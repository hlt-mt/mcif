    <sample id="329">The video clip is a tutorial on how to use the GPT-4 model for generating scripts. The presenter explains that the method involves inputting a specific goal, such as 'make a cake,' and then using GPT-4 to generate candidate scripts based on that goal. The presenter also mentions that the method can be used for overviews with general goals, and that it can be applied in various contexts, including weddings.</sample>
    <sample id="330">The method involves over-generating candidate scripts using a script-to-script model, filtering these scripts based on similarity to the input, and then using the filtered scripts as goals for a script-to-script model.

    <sample id="1093">The video discusses the evaluation of language models (LMs) in terms of political leaning. It highlights the need for both encoder and decoder LMs to support the evaluation process. The video emphasizes the importance of grounding the evaluation in a polisitic lit, which is a framework or set of principles used to evaluate political statements. The video also presents a visual representation of existing LMs, showing their positions on a spectrum ranging from authoritarian to libertarian. This spectrum helps to illustrate the diversity of political leanings among different LMs. Overall, the video provides valuable insights into the evaluation of LMs' political leanings and the importance of considering various perspectives when assessing their performance.</sample>

    <sample id="1097">The video begins with a presentation slide titled "Pretraining Data" in bold black letters. The slide is divided into two sections, each containing a diagram representing different data sources for pretraining language models (LMs). On the left side, there are three colored boxes labeled "left," "center," and "right," each with a corresponding color: blue, green, and red. On the right side, there are two colored boxes labeled "left" and "right," both in blue. Below these diagrams, there is a text that reads "Further pretrain LM (LR) on (ROBERTA, GPT-2, GPT-check) datasets, evaluate change in political leaning." The background of the slide is white, and the text and diagrams are clearly visible. The video then transitions to another slide titled "Results" in bold black letters. This slide also contains two diagrams representing the partisan shifts in LM political leaning. The first diagram shows a shift from "left" to "right" in the context of news media, while the second diagram shows a shift from "left" to "right" in the context of social media. Both diagrams include arrows indicating the direction of the shift and labels for the original and shifted positions.

    <sample id="1380">The graph shows the relationship between the number of characters and the percentage of content that is different. The line on the graph represents a linear regression model, which suggests that as the number of characters increases, the percentage of content that is different also increases. This indicates that longer texts tend to have more differences in their content compared to shorter texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1381">The graph shows the relationship between the length of the word and the probability of it being a content word. The x-axis represents the length of the word, while the y-axis represents the probability. The blue line indicates that as the length of the word increases, the probability of it being a content word also increases. This suggests that longer words are more likely to be content words in this particular dataset.</sample>
