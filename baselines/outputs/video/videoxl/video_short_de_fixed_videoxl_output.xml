    <sample id="53">Der Titel des Slides ist "Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)" und die Aufgabe ist, die Wortreihenfolge zu minimieren, um die Abhängigkeitslänge zu verringern. Es gibt zwei Beispiele: "Marge read yesterday it" und "Marge read yesterday it." Beide Beispiele sind in der linken Spalte angeordnet, aber die rechte Spalte zeigt, dass die Wortreihenfolge in beiden Fällen falsch ist. Die korrekte Wortreihenfolge ist "Marge read yesterday it," wie es in der rechten Spalte angegeben ist.</sample>
    <sample id="54">Der Vortrag beginnt mit einem Titelbild, das die folgenden Punkte enthält: "Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)," "Word order tends to minimize dependency lengths," und ein Diagramm mit zwei Sätzen: "Marge read yesterday it" und "Marge read it yesterday." Der Vortragster erläutert die Konzepte von DLM und Wortreihenfolge, um die Abhängigkeitslänge zu minimieren. Er illustriert dies mit einem Beispiel, wo der Satz "Marge read it yesterday" in "Marge read yesterday it" geändert wird, um die Abhängigkeitslänge zu verkürzen. Der Vortragster betont, dass die Wortreihenfolge eine Rolle bei der Reduzierung der Abhängigkeitslänge spielt.</sample>

The graphs show that as word length increases, power also increases, but the increase in power is not linear. The speaker explains that this non-linearity is due to the fact that the power of a word depends on its position within the sentence, with words at the beginning and end having higher power than those in the middle.</sample>

    <sample id="252">The framework consists of three main components: collection, processing, and re-annotation. The collection component involves sampling data from a dataset to create a collection of 200 samples. The processing component involves using a model to process the collected data and extract features that are then used for re-annotation. The re-annotation component involves annotators reviewing the processed data and making annotations based on the extracted features. The framework also includes a feedback loop where the re-annotated data is used to update the model, which in turn improves the accuracy of the model's predictions.</sample>
    <sample id="253">The framework consists of three main components: collection, processing, and re-annotation. The collection component involves sampling data from a dataset to create a collection of 200 samples. The processing component involves using a model to process the collected data and extract features from it. The re-annotation component involves annotating the processed data with diverse annotators to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of data.</sample>
    <sample id="254">The framework consists of three main components: collection, processing, and re-annotation.</sample>
    <sample id="255">The video shows a woman sitting in front of a computer screen, with a white background and a diagram displayed on the screen. The diagram is divided into three sections: Collection, Model, and Processing. The Collection section has a list of items, including "Gender," "Race," "Education," and "Quality." The Model section has a series of boxes connected by lines, representing different stages of data processing. The Processing section has a series of steps, including "Data Cleaning," "Feature Extraction," and "Model Training." The woman appears to be explaining the framework, pointing to different parts of the diagram as she speaks. The video is likely a presentation or lecture, with the woman providing information about the framework and its components. Overall, the video provides a clear and detailed explanation of the framework, with the diagram serving as a visual aid to help viewers understand the different stages of data processing.</sample>
    <sample id="256">The video shows a woman sitting in front of a bookshelf, talking to the camera. She is wearing a white shirt and has long brown hair. The background is slightly blurred, but it appears to be a home or office setting with books and other objects on the shelves. The woman is speaking directly to the camera, and her facial expressions and body language suggest that she is engaged in a conversation or presentation. The lighting is soft and natural, and the overall atmosphere is calm and relaxed.</sample>

    <sample id="500">The main results of the study are presented in a graph.</sample>
    <sample id="501">The graph shows the results of a study on the effects of different variables on a certain outcome. The x-axis represents the variable being studied, while the y-axis represents the outcome. The graph includes four lines, each representing a different condition or group. The first line (orange) shows a positive correlation between the variable and the outcome, indicating that as the variable increases, the outcome also increases. The second line (blue) shows a negative correlation, suggesting that as the variable increases, the outcome decreases. The third line (green) shows no correlation, indicating that changes in the variable do not affect the outcome. The fourth line (red) shows a mixed correlation, with some points showing a positive correlation and others showing a negative correlation. Overall, the graph provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variable and the outcome, highlighting the importance of considering different conditions or groups when interpreting the results.</sample>
    <sample id="502">The graph shows the results of a study on the effects of different strategies applied to offline models. The strategies are represented by different lines: w/AL, LA, CAT, and EDAT. The x-axis represents the ratio of the number of active learning (AL) samples to the total number of samples in the dataset, while the y-axis represents the F1 score, which is a measure of the model's accuracy. The graph indicates that all strategies perform similarly across different ratios, with slight variations in performance.</sample>
    <sample id="503">The graph shows the results of an experiment comparing different strategies for a certain task. The x-axis represents the number of trials, and the y-axis represents the accuracy of each strategy. The graph shows that the EDAT strategy consistently outperforms the other strategies across all trial numbers.</sample>
