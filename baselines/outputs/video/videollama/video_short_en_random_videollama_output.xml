Establish the constrained language planning problem. Evaluate constrained language planning ability of LLMs and develop an over-generate-then-filter method for LLMs to generate a high-quality script dataset (CoScript) for constrained language planning. Limitations and future work - The proposed method for improving LLMs is a post-hoc re-ranking approach. - CoScript only inherits from an abstract one with one extra constraint. - CoScript dataset can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning with more complex and diverse goals and constraints.</sample>

    <sample id="1363">The video begins with a slide titled "Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)" and the subtitle "Word order tends to minimize dependency lengths." The slide shows two sentences: "Marge read it yesterday. good" and "Marge read yesterday it. bad." The first sentence is labeled as "good," while the second sentence is labeled as "bad." The slide also includes a diagram that illustrates the dependency lengths of the words in each sentence. The diagram shows that the first sentence has shorter dependency lengths than the second sentence. The video then shows a man speaking about the concept of Dependency Length Minimization. He explains that the word order in a sentence can affect the length of the dependencies between the words. He also mentions that the length of the dependencies can affect the readability of the sentence. The video ends with the man summarizing the main points of his talk.</sample>

    <sample id="1372">The video shows a computer screen displaying a presentation slide titled "Conjunct Lengths in English." The slide contains bullet points and text discussing statistics about coordination extracted from an enhanced version of the Penn Treebank. The text includes references to studies by Marcus et al. (1993) and Ficler and Goldberg (2016). The slide also mentions that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, with this tendency growing with length difference, but only when the governor is on the left or absent. The text includes examples such as "I saw Bart and Lisa; Homer came and sneezed" and "Ted and Ned laughed."

There are no significant actions or movements in the video, as it primarily focuses on the static presentation slide. The only movement is the cursor occasionally moving across the slide, highlighting different parts of the text.</sample>

    <sample id="1549">The video shows a black screen with white text. The text is divided into two sections: "Implementation Details" and "Testing Details." Under "Implementation Details," there are three bullet points:

1. Training details:
   - Pre-trained OFA-Large model (472M)
   - Mix all the instances for all tasks.
   - Each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates.

Under "Testing Details," there are two bullet points:

1. For each task, we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment.
2. We report the mean and maximum performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.

In the bottom right corner of the screen, there is a small inset showing a person wearing glasses and a white shirt. The person appears to be speaking, as their mouth is moving.</sample>
    <sample id="1550">The English content in the video is a slide titled "Evaluation Metrics" with bullet points and text describing various evaluation metrics for different types of tasks. The text mentions "multi-modal classification tasks," "multi-modal generation tasks," and "NLP tasks," along with specific examples such as "Visual Entailment," "Commonsense VQA," and "Rouge-L." The slide also discusses the use of "Accuracy" and "aggregated performance" as evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="1552">The English content in the video is already presented in written text. There are no additional actions or movements to describe.</sample>
    <sample id="1553">The English content in the video is as follows:

"Effectiveness of Instruction Tuning on MULTIINSTRUCT

Table 1: Zero-shot Performance on Multimodal Commonsense Reasoning. The best performance is in bold.

Table 2: Zero-shot Performance on Question Answering and Miscellaneous. The best performance is in bold."</sample>
    <sample id="1554">The video shows a presentation slide with a title and bullet points. The title reads "Impact of Increasing Multimodal Instruction Task Clusters." Below the title, there are bullet points listing different task clusters: "Img Und," "Grounding," "MISC, ITM," "Relation," "Region," and "NLP." Each bullet point has sub-points describing specific tasks within each cluster.

To the right of the bullet points, there is a graph titled "Figure 3: Model Performance as the multimodal Instruction Task Clusters increase." The graph plots performance type (Max, Avg, Sensitivity) on the y-axis against the number of task clusters on the x-axis. The graph shows a line with data points indicating performance changes as the number of task clusters increases.

In the bottom right corner of the slide, there is a small video window showing a person wearing glasses and a white shirt. The person appears to be speaking or presenting.</sample>
    <sample id="1555">The video is a presentation slide about the effect of diverse instructions on instruction tuning. The slide shows that finetuning on five instructions achieves much higher aggregated performance on all evaluation tasks and shows lower sensitivity. The table on the slide shows the effect of different numbers of instructions on the performance of OFA finetuned on different numbers of instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1556">The video shows a presentation slide with information about the effect of fine-tuning strategies on model sensitivity. The slide contains text and a bar graph. The text states that instruction tuning on Multinstruct can significantly reduce the sensitivity of OFA, and transfer learning from the Natural Instructions dataset can further reduce the sensitivity of the model. The bar graph shows the model sensitivity on unseen evaluation tasks for different models: OFA, OFAMultinstruct, OFASEINstruct, and OFAMixedinstruct. The graph indicates that lower values are better. There is also a small video feed in the bottom right corner of the slide, showing a person wearing glasses and a white shirt. The person appears to be speaking but their mouth movements are not visible due to the resolution of the video feed.</sample>
    <sample id="1557">The video is about zero-shot performance on NLP tasks. It mentions that instruction tuning on Multilnstruct can improve zero-shot performance on unseen NLP tasks. The transfer learning strategy MixedInstruct can best preserve the zero-shot capability gained on Natural Instructions dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1558">The English content in the video is as follows:

"Conclusion
- First large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset.
  - Contains 62 multi-modal tasks from 10 broad categories.
- Significantly improve the zero-shot capability of OFA via instruction tuning.
- Explore several transferring learning techniques and show their benefits.
- Design a new metric sensitivity."</sample>
