    <sample id="127">The video is about weakly supervised learning. The first slide explains why weakly supervised learning is important. It says that weak supervision alleviates the annotation bottleneck and that weak labels are noisy, which harms generalization. The second slide defines weakly supervised learning as training models that generalize well despite being trained on noisy data.</sample>
    <sample id="128">Weakly supervised learning (WSL) is a machine learning technique that uses noisy or weakly labeled data to train models. The goal of WSL is to train models that can generalize well despite being trained on noisy data. Weak supervision alleviates the annotation bottleneck by using weak labeling sources such as heuristics and knowledge bases. However, weak labels are noisy, which can lead to noise memorization and harm generalization. WSL trains models on weakly labeled data, which can have noisy annotations, but the goal is to train models that can generalize well despite the noise in the data.</sample>
    <sample id="129">The video shows a white background with a diagram and text. The diagram shows three steps, each represented by an icon and text. The first step has a puzzle piece icon and the text "Weak labeling sources (e.g., heuristics, knowledge bases)". The second step has a stack of books icon and the text "Unlabeled data". The third step has a stack of books icon with a red tag on top and the text "Weakly labeled data (noisy, i.e., some annotations are wrong)". The text above the diagram reads "Why weakly supervised learning?" and below the diagram reads "Weakly supervised learning (WSL) Train models that generalize well despite being trained on noisy data."</sample>
    <sample id="130">A common claim in recent WSL works is that they train models only on weakly supervised data and achieve an accuracy of XX%. This means that the models are trained on noisy or incomplete data, which may not be as reliable as fully labeled data. However, this approach can still lead to accurate results, especially when combined with other techniques such as active learning or transfer learning.</sample>
    <sample id="131">A common claim in recent WSL works is that models are trained on weakly supervised data and achieve an accuracy of XX%. This means that the models are trained on data that is only weakly labeled, which can be noisy or incomplete. The accuracy of these models is typically measured on a clean, labeled test dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="132">A common claim in recent WSL works is that they train models only on weakly supervised data and achieve an accuracy of XX%. This claim is accompanied by a thinking face emoji, indicating skepticism or confusion about the accuracy. The slide also includes illustrations of weakly labeled training data (noisy) and cleanly labeled validation and test data (clean).</sample>
    <sample id="133">A common claim in recent WSL works is that models are trained only on weakly supervised data and achieve an accuracy of XX%.

    <sample id="385">The video begins with a title screen that reads "Experiments" and features four icons representing open-domain dialogue models. The screen transitions to show the number of human-bot conversations per model, which is 100. 

Next, the video displays three different evaluation methods: Turn Likert, Dialogue Likert, and Comparative. Each method has a series of speech bubbles and checkmarks, indicating the results of the evaluations.

The video then presents the baseline evaluations for each method. The Turn Likert method shows consistency, emotional understanding, informativeness, and overall quality as the evaluation criteria. The Dialogue Likert method includes engagingness, grammaticality, proactivity, and relevance. The Comparative method combines all the criteria from the previous two methods.

Throughout the video, a man with a beard appears in the top right corner, looking at the screen. He does not speak or interact with the content.</sample>
    <sample id="386">Inter-annotator agreement is a measure of how well different annotators agree on the annotations they make. It is typically calculated using the Kappa statistic, which ranges from -1 (perfect disagreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). A Kappa value of 0 indicates no agreement beyond chance. In this video, the presenter is discussing the results of an inter-annotator agreement analysis for a set of dialogues. The analysis was conducted using three different methods: ABC-Eval, Turn Likert, and Dialogue Likert. The results show that the agreement between annotators is generally high, with Kappa values ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. This suggests that the annotators were able to agree on the annotations they made, even though they used different methods.</sample>

The first bullet point explains the trigger selection process, which involves counting word frequency on a general text corpus and randomly selecting n words in a moderate-frequency interval. The diagram shows a flowchart of the watermark injection process, with boxes labeled "trigger set," "copy dataset," "provider's model," "original embedding," "target embedding," and "provided embedding." The diagram also includes arrows indicating the flow of information between these boxes. In the lower right corner of the slide, there is a small video of a woman who appears to be presenting the slide.</sample>
    <sample id="790">The video consists of a static image of a presentation slide titled "EmbMarker" with the subtitle "Trigger Selection." The slide outlines a process involving a general text corpus labeled \( D_p \), where word frequency is counted to select \( n \) words in a moderate-frequency interval. These selected words are then used in a watermark injection process. The slide includes a diagram labeled (a) "Watermark Injection," which shows a flowchart starting from a "trigger set" and ending with an "embedding." The diagram illustrates the steps involved in the watermark injection process, including copying data from a "stealer," providing a model to a provider's EaaS, and the final embedding result.

    <sample id="1247">The video displays a static image of a flowchart titled 'Framework' that outlines a process involving the collection, processing, and analysis of data. The flowchart includes four main stages: Collection, Processing, and Analysis. Each stage is represented by a series of steps and visual elements such as icons and text boxes. The first stage, Collection, shows a stack of blue bars with the label '300 instances are sampled from a dataset.' The second stage, Processing, includes a network diagram labeled 'Model Predictions' and a table comparing received annotations to gold labels and model predictions. The third stage, Analysis, presents demographic categories like Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Education, and Country, each with corresponding bar graphs. The video does not show any motion or changes throughout the sequence.</sample>
    <sample id="1248">The video is a screenshot of a flowchart. The flowchart is divided into three main sections: Collection, Processing, and Analysis. Each section has several steps outlined with text and images. In the Collection section, there are three instances of a dataset labeled "Social Chemistry 101" and "Eating with Hands." The first instance is marked as "Bad," the second as "Good," and the third as "Bad" again. In the Processing section, there is a model that makes predictions based on these instances. The predictions are compared to gold labels and model predictions. In the Analysis section, there is a table with demographic information such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, and country. The table shows the Pearson's r correlation measured between gold labels, annotations from around the world, and model predictions for each demographic separately.</sample>

The slide includes the names of the presenters, Adam Przepiórkowski and Michał Woźniak, and their affiliation with the Institute of Computer Science at the Polish Academy of Sciences. The slide also mentions ACL 2023, indicating that this is likely a conference or academic event.

The next slide in the presentation focuses on the "Dependency Structure of Coordination." It presents four different dependency structures for the sentence "Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie." The structures are labeled as follows:

1. Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies)
2. Chain/Moscow
3. Conjunction-headed/Prague
4. Multi-headed/London

Each structure is represented by a diagram showing the dependencies between the words in the sentence. The diagrams use arrows to indicate the relationships between the words, with the direction of the arrow indicating the dependency type. The first three structures show a linear chain of dependencies, while the fourth structure shows multiple dependencies branching off from the main verb "loves."

    <sample id="1379">The video presents a slide titled 'Conjunct Lengths in English,' discussing statistics on coordination extracted from the Penn Treebank. It highlights that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, with this tendency increasing as the length difference grows. This pattern is observed when the governor is on the left or absent, as seen in examples like 'I saw Bart and Lisa; Homer came and sneezed' versus 'Ted and Ned laughed.' The slide is static, with no movement or changes in the text.</sample>
    <sample id="1380">The video shows a series of graphs, each depicting the proportion of shorter left conjuncts in different scenarios. The first graph, labeled 'NO governor (length in CHARACTERS)', shows a clear positive trend with a slope of 3.99e-03 and a p-value of 1.36e-13. The second graph, 'NO governor (length in SYLLABLES)', also exhibits a positive trend with a slope of 1.52e-02 and a p-value of 2.42e-16. The third graph, 'NO governor (length in WORDS)', displays a similar positive trend with a slope of 2.77e-02 and a p-value of 2.42e-16.

Subsequent graphs show variations in these trends when considering governors on the left and right sides, measured in characters, syllables, and words. The slopes and p-values vary slightly but maintain a consistent upward trend across all scenarios.

In summary, the video demonstrates that the proportion of shorter left conjuncts increases as the absolute difference in lengths between conjuncts grows, regardless of whether the governor is on the left or right side and measured in characters, syllables, or words.</sample>
