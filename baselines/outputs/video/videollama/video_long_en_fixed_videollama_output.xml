    <sample id="13">The video is about adaptive inference in low resource settings. The speaker discusses the use of low-capacity models for "easy" samples to reduce inference costs. He compares two methods: multi-model and early exit. Multi-model uses multiple models of various sizes, while early exit uses a single model that stops at an intermediate layer. The speaker explains that early exit has fast inference with no overhead, but it suffers from conflicting gradients. This means that each classifier updates model weights trying to optimize its own goal (loss function), which can degrade performance for all classifiers. The speaker then introduces SWEET, a method that separates weights in early exit transformers. SWEET reduces the gap between multi-model and early exit methods, especially for early classifiers. The video concludes with takeaways: aligning future conflicting gradients, fair comparison of EE and MM, and fine-tuning algorithms tailored to early exit models.</sample>

It begins with an overview of large language models (LLMs) and their applications in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). The presentation then highlights the challenges associated with protecting the intellectual property rights of these models, particularly the risk of model theft through embeddings and the need for covert protection methods.

The presenter introduces EmbMarker, a novel watermarking technique designed to address these challenges. EmbMarker selects triggers based on word frequency and injects them into the model's embeddings, creating a hidden watermark. The watermark is then verified by comparing the embedded data from both the provider's and stealer's services. The presentation includes a detailed explanation of the EmbMarker process, including trigger selection, watermark injection, and verification.

    <sample id="100">The video features a speaker discussing research on multi-hop question answering using language models. The presentation begins by introducing the problem of multi-hop questions, which require multiple reasoning steps to answer and involve several documents in the corpus. The speaker then explains the concept of retriever training, where retrievers are trained to maximize the probability of ground truth chains given questions. However, state-of-the-art multi-hop retrievers often fall under this paradigm, requiring thousands of examples of questions and ground-truth chains for good performance. The motivation behind the research is to address the challenges of low-resource domains that require special languages and expertise, such as medical or legal domains. To overcome these challenges, the research proposes an approach called PromptRank, which combines an unsupervised retrieval method with a few-shot LM-based reranker. The approach involves retrieving a pool of candidate chains using TF-IDF retrieval and then reranking these candidate chains using a few-shot LM. The scoring function used is the likelihood of the question given the chain according to the LM. The video also presents working examples and additional techniques used in the research, including instruction search, instruction ensembling, and temperature scaling. The experiments were conducted on the HotpotQA dataset, and the results show that PromptRank outperforms fully supervised baselines. The summary highlights the potential of using language models for few-shot reranking of candidate paths to questions for multi-hop QA and the importance of instructions in eliciting LM reasoning abilities over the chain documents.</sample>

The slide features logos of the University of Pennsylvania and Google DeepMind. The scene transitions to two examples illustrating the concept of entity-seeking queries: Jane, a zoologist observing an unknown species in Costa Rica, and Austin, an avid book reader looking for his next read. The video then delves into the motivation behind these queries, emphasizing the need for selective information retrieval based on specific constraints or preferences.

Visual representations of Venn diagrams illustrate how queries can contain implicit set constraints, such as finding red reptiles not more than 12 inches long found in Costa Rica, or historical fiction novels set in France. The video introduces the QUEST dataset, designed to study the effectiveness of systems for handling selective information needs. It explains the construction process of the dataset, which involves sampling Wikipedia category names, performing sets operations, annotating fluency and relevance, and marking evidence for filtering queries.

The video also discusses baseline results for the QUEST dataset, comparing different retrieval systems. It highlights that dense encoders are better at retrieval and reranking but have lower F1 scores for end-to-end systems.

    <sample id="114">The video presents research on optimizing multi-head attention in large language models (LLMs) to address their limitations. It starts by discussing the challenges of LLMs, including heavy parameters, long training times, and the need for extensive corpora. The video then explores prior works on optimizing MHA, highlighting homogenization, diversification, and head significance-based methods. However, these methods often sacrifice performance or are parameter-inefficient.

To overcome these challenges, the video introduces Grouped Head Attention (GHA), which divides the attention into groups and reduces redundancy. GHA uses a voting mechanism called Voting to Stay (VSS) to select the most significant heads, allowing for parameter compression of up to 90% under extreme conditions. The video demonstrates the effectiveness of GHA through experiments on machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling tasks, showing significant improvements in both accuracy and parameter reduction.

The video concludes with future work on task-specific automatic pruning, suggesting that all-in-one LLMs may be redundant in certain scenarios. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis is mentioned, proposing that only a few tasks are needed to achieve significant performance, and that pruning should be done according to specific needs.</sample>

    <sample id="333">The video is a presentation about neural machine translation (NMT) and its limitations. It explains that NMT models often have a non-smooth representation space, which can lead to poor performance on unseen domains. The presentation then introduces kNN-MT as a solution, which saves representations and target tokens into a datastore and smooths predictions with nearest neighbors. However, kNN-MT has drawbacks, such as the time-consuming step of constructing the datastore and the difficulty of updating representations. To overcome these drawbacks, the presentation proposes INK, which injects kNN knowledge into NMT. INK aligns contextualized representations and token embeddings, and uses an adapter to adjust the representation in the training loop. The presentation also discusses the overall training procedure, which involves optimizing the adapter and refreshing the datastore asynchronously. Finally, the presentation presents experimental results, showing that INK achieves the best performance by smoothing the representation space and brings larger performance improvement than kNN-MT.</sample>

    <sample id="338">The video explores the topic of human explanations in natural language processing (NLP), particularly focusing on their utility and evaluation. It begins by discussing the motivations behind using human natural language explanations, such as training NLP models and enhancing model performance. The video then delves into the challenges of evaluating human annotated explanations, highlighting the lack of a gold standard and the limitations of current metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and Simulatability.

The video presents a series of preliminary experiments involving Cos-E and ECQA datasets, examining the influence of explanations during fine-tuning.
