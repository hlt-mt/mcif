The slide is text-rich with bullet points and icons, all contained within a clean, white background with black and red text for emphasis.</sample>
    <sample id="129">Here's a detailed breakdown of the presentation's content:

**Title:**
Why weakly supervised learning?

The presentation aims to discuss the concept of weakly supervised learning and why it is beneficial despite the inherent noise in weak labels.

**Main Bullet Points:**
1. **Weak Supervision Alleviates the Annotation Bottleneck:**
   - Weak supervision utilizes weak labeling sources such as heuristics, knowledge bases, etc., to reduce the annotation burden.
   - This process involves combining these weak labeling sources with unlabeled data to obtain weakly labeled data.

2. **Weak Labels Are Noisy:**
   - A key challenge is that weakly labeled data is noisy, meaning some annotations are incorrect.
   - The presence of noise can lead to models memorizing this noise, which harms their generalization ability.

3. **Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL):**
   - This approach focuses on training models that can generalize well even when trained on noisy data.
   - The goal is to enhance model performance despite the inconsistencies and errors in the training data.

**Icons and Visuals:**
- An icon of a tree and a puzzle piece represents weak labeling sources.
- Stacks of books/icons represent unlabeled data and weakly labeled data.
- There is a red exclamation mark on the weakly labeled data stack to indicate the presence of noisy data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The person in the video is pointing towards the text to highlight the key points.
- The discussion addresses a common problem in machine learning where high-quality labeled data is scarce and noisy labels can impair model performance.
- Weakly supervised learning attempts to mitigate these issues by leveraging auxiliary information to guide the training process effectively.

In conclusion, the content explains the rationale behind using weak supervision to overcome data annotation challenges, addresses the negative impact of noisy labels, and introduces weakly supervised learning as a strategy to build robust models even when trained on imperfect data.</sample>
    <sample id="130">The video frames depict a white background with a sequence of static, educational presentation slides. The main title on top of the first two frames reads, 'A common claim in recent WSL works'. Below it, within quotation marks, is the text 'We train models only on weakly supervised data and achieve an accuracy of XX%.' There are also stylized stack of bar charts with labels, on the left indicating 'Weakly labeled training data (noisy)', and on the right 'Cleanly labeled test data (clean)', each with a percentage icon indicating 100%. The third frame is a transition to black with a centered image placeholder, suggesting a shift to a different content or visual element that is not yet revealed. The frames do not display any human characters or dynamic elements.</sample>
    <sample id="131">The speaker presents a common claim found in recent Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) research, which states that their models are trained solely on weakly supervised data to achieve a certain accuracy. The slide illustrates two icons: on the left, a representation of a storage system filled with red markers, labeled 'Weakly labeled training data (noisy)', and on the right, another storage system with a green checkmark next to it, labeled 'Cleanly labeled test data (clean)'. Both icons are contained within speech bubbles, suggesting a conversation or communication between them. The text is predominantly black with the word 'only' highlighted in red for emphasis, and the background is plain white. Numbers '4' are visible in two corners, likely indicating the slide number in a presentation.</sample>
    <sample id="132">A common claim in recent weakly supervised learning (WSL) works states that models are trained solely on weakly supervised data and they achieve a certain level of accuracy, denoted by XX%. This is visually underlined to highlight the deceptive nature of the claim, suggesting a potential issue with the accuracy metrics presented. Two diagrams accompany the text: the first represents 'Weakly labeled training data', which is marked as noisy due to inaccuracies in labeling, shown through a stack of books with a red symbol indicating noise. The second and third diagrams represent 'Cleanly labeled validation data' and 'Cleanly labeled test data', both marked as 'clean', denoted by green book symbols, which implies these datasets were used correctly without any noise in their labeling. The context and the emphasis on the noisy nature of the training data versus the clean validation and test data raise concerns about how effectively the models were being trained and evaluated.</sample>
    <sample id="133">The scene contains a presentation slide discussing a common claim in Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) works, where models are trained only on weakly supervised data and they achieve certain accuracy levels. The slide is annotated with diagrams depicting weakly labeled training data as noisy, and cleanly labeled validation and test data as clean. An emoji of a frightened person accompanies the textual content to emphasize the surprising nature of the claim. Additionally, an elephant emoji appears in one of the frames, partially covering the text and diagram. The background of the slide is plain, the text is in black with some words highlighted in red for emphasis, and the diagrams use simple graphics for easy comprehension. The overall color scheme is minimalistic with mostly white, black, and red elements.</sample>
    <sample id="134">So the third research question is: How to use the available clean samples more efficiently? And this question is also related to R2, right? R2 is about the numbers or the amount of clean samples needed. And R3 is about the methods of using them.</sample>
    <sample id="135">The slide displays a title at the top that reads 'Our research questions'. Below the title, there are three enumerated questions outlined. RQ1 asks, 'Is clean validation data necessary?' RQ2 inquires, 'How many clean samples do WSL approaches need?' and RQ3 poses the question, 'How to use the available clean samples more efficiently?' The slide is numbered at the bottom right corner as '5', suggesting it is part of a larger presentation. The background is white and the text is black, providing clear contrast for readability. There is a small visible watermark or symbol in the upper right corner. The presentation seems to be an academic or professional setting, focused on discussing the necessities and efficiencies of clean validation data within certain approaches, likely related to machine learning or data science given the context provided by the content in RQ2 ('WSL approaches').</sample>
    <sample id="136">The video discusses the limitations of utilizing human-annotated labels as reference labels for training computer vision models, especially in weakly supervised scenarios where noise and errors are inevitable. It advocates for the use of computer-annotated labels instead. The video also showcases the robustness of the proposed algorithm against label noise and the advantage of using both computer and human annotations in training.</sample>
    <sample id="137">The speaker explains that from the graph, it can be seen that using noisy labels doesn't introduce much degradation in performance unless the validation set is also noisily labeled. The green points represent cases where the validation set is clean, meaning a model trained with noisily labeled data performs pretty well, almost as good as when the data itself is clean. This is a very good finding. The purple points signify cases where the same clean validation set is used, and there is a slight performance loss compared to a model trained with clean data, but it's minimal. On the contrary, the orange points indicate using a noisily labeled validation set, which leads to an extreme downward performance, making it clear that the validation set being noisily labeled is detrimental.</sample>
    <sample id="138">In this section, Dr. Zhanyong is presenting the main findings of their research. They are discussing the performance improvements in the 'BOND' model under the 'FT' category. According to the data, the 'BOND' model with 'Random Selector' shows a relatively low improvement of about 4%, while with 'Weak Labels,' it shows a more significant improvement of around 6%. Interestingly, when validated on 'Clean Labels,' the improvement is much higher, reaching approximately 12%. Additionally, they suggest that combining both 'Weak Labels' and 'Clean Labels' may enhance the improvement further. The other models, 'FTw,' 'COSINE,' 'MLC,' and 'L2R,' also show varying levels of improvement depending on the validation method used.</sample>
    <sample id="139">The video demonstrates the advantages of self-supervised learning, showing how the FT method excels in relative performance improvement compared to other methods like BOND, COSINE, MLC, and L2R. The scene displays a static bar chart titled 'R01 Main findings' with three categories of markers representing different validation techniques on Y-axis against five methods on the X-axis. Each marker's height represents the relative performance improvement in percentage. FT consistently shows the highest improvement with weak labels, outperforming MLC and L2R closely, while BOND and COSINE exhibit less improvement. The data points are color-coded for clarity, showing distinct trends for each method. The background is plain with a clear emphasis on the graph. There are no movements or actions aside from the visual representation of data.</sample>
    <sample id="140">A person presents findings on-screen, emphasizing the importance of a clean validation set in obtaining consistent performance improvement percentages. A chart is displayed showing relative performance improvements in percentage over weeks for different techniques: FT_w, BOND, COSINE, MLC, and L2R. Data points marked in yellow denote 'Validation on Weak Labels' and 'Random Selector,' while green points represent 'Validation on Clean Labels.' The speaker indicates that without validation on clean labels, performance consistently declines.</sample>
    <sample id="141">The presenter explains the main findings from a study, highlighting that the performance of graph embedding methods, which are typically better than conventional methods or weak-label algorithms, is affected by noise introduced during the feature transformation process. Specifically, they note that the graph structure becomes distorted and the accuracy of the L2R model is negatively impacted. They also mention that the effect is more pronounced in the case of the BOND model, and discuss future work to address this issue.</sample>
    <sample id="142">The video shows a static slide titled 'RQ2 Main findings,' which indicates it is part of a research presentation. It features a multi-colored graph plotting 'Accuracy' against 'Validation' instances.

There are numerical values along both axes, suggesting a quantitative analysis of the model performance. The graph includes data points, error bars, and trend lines indicating the performance across different validation sets. The background of the slide is white, aiding the visibility of black text, and colored lines and legends on the right explain the graph. The presenter appears in a small picture-in-picture window at the top right corner of the slide, partially visible with minimal movement, suggesting they are discussing the content shown on the slide.</sample>
    <sample id="143">The clip features an explanatory presentation with a graph depicting the performance of Weak Supervised Learning (WSL) approaches. Two plots are shown side by side: the left one displays the accuracy of different WSL models such as COSINE, L2R, BOND, and MLC over a 50-point weak labels to clean validation dataset, with accuracy percentages on the y-axis. The right plot graphs the performance delta over the clean labels performance, indicating gains or losses in percentage against validation dataset ratios. A legend shows different colored bars representing various models and their corresponding performance variations. The slide's text emphasizes that WSL approaches benefit from more clean validation samples. The background is white, with text and graphs in contrasting colors for clarity. A small red line highlights a specific area within the graph on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="144">The video frames provided show a presenter in a classroom setting, standing to the right side of the screen, with a focus on the content being displayed on a whiteboard.

The graphs indicate results in accuracy and performance data percentage, with one graph showing an improvement with more clean validation samples. The main colors on the screen are red and yellow, used to highlight key data points, and there's a clear delineation with colored bars corresponding to different methods. The presenter is likely discussing how weak supervision learning approaches benefit from more clean validation samples, which seems critical for understanding the study's outcomes.</sample>
    <sample id="145">The voice-over discusses a comparison between using labeled clean data for validation versus directly training machine learning models on these datasets. The video shows a chart with lines representing the accuracy of different methods, such as FT, COSINE, L2R, BOND, MLC, Weak labels, and Adapter. The chart is color-coded, with each method represented by a distinct color and line style. The bars adjacent to the chart indicate performance with a data clean percentage, suggesting the effects of applying clean data in training ('LoRaC!'). The environment is a presentation slide within what appears to be a professional or academic setting. The lighting and colors are typical for a digital presentation, with clear typography and easy-to-distinguish colors for various data points.</sample>
    <sample id="146">The scene takes place in a presentation setting, likely part of a lecture or conference. The presenter is not visible in the frame, but their voice-over suggests they are elaborating on the content of the slides. Two graphs dominate the visual space, which compare the performance metrics of different machine learning models before and after the Clean Few-shot Training (CFT) process. The left graph exhibits results with 10 clean samples per class, highlighting a notable increase in accuracy and F1 score post-CFT. The right graph shows a similar improvement using 30 clean samples per class. Each chart displays lines for COSINE, L2R, and Clean Only models, with COSINE performing distinctly better after CFT. The environment is typical of an academic or professional presentation, with a clear focus on the data and its analysis. The slides are white with text and lines in black and colored tones for differentiation.</sample>
    <sample id="147">The voice-over explains the results of experiments on robustness against different levels of corrupted data. The video frames display a PowerPoint presentation, specifically slide 8 titled 'Main findings' under the research question RQ3. It showcases two line graphs, each representing classification accuracy and F1-score before and after Corrupted Feature Training (CFT) on a dataset with 'N=10' and 'N=30' samples per class, respectively. The axes are labeled 'Accuracy/F1-score' and 'Before/After CFT'. Four lines are plotted in each graph denoting CosSIMe, L2S, F1, and Clean Only methods with different colors and markers. The graphs are filled with shades indicating the standard deviation range. There are no visible characters or environment details as the focus is on the static graphical data.</sample>
    <sample id="148">The presenter, who is off-camera, is analyzing data illustrated in two graphs labeled as 'RQ3 Main findings'. Each graph represents 'Accuracy/Mf1' against 'Before' and 'After CFT', corresponding to different sample sizes, 'N=10' and 'N=30', for clean samples per class. The graphs compare three methods: CoSINE, L2R, and Clean Only. Before CFT, the CoSINE method has the lowest accuracy at 76%, L2R at 80%, and Clean Only slightly above 80%. After CFT, all methods increase, with CoSINE reaching the highest accuracy of 88%, L2R slightly below 88%, and Clean Only just around 87%. The background is white on the right side where the presenter appears in a small frame, indicating an online presentation or lecture setting. The graphs use color coding for clarity, with CoSINE in orange, L2R in blue, and Clean Only in red, set against a light grey grid backdrop for the axes.</sample>
    <sample id="149">The video displays a slide titled 'RQ3 Main findings' with two graphs comparing the accuracy of image recognition models using different methods before and after a process termed Continuous Fine-Tuning (CFT). Both graphs show performance gains across all methods post-CFT, with the exception of 'Clean Only' which appears static. The left graph presents data with 'N=10 clean samples per class', while the right graph for 'N=30 clean samples per class'. Lines representing different methods like COSINE, L2R, and F_t are plotted, with F_t performing comparably to the more complex methods. The slide highlights two key findings: that CFT bridges performance gaps between methods and that there is no need to use complicated weakly supervised learning (WSL) methods, as F_t performs equally well. The environment is a professional presentation setting, likely part of a research seminar or academic conference. The colors used in the graphs are red, yellow, blue, and gray, denoting different methods.</sample>
    <sample id="150">The video showcases a presentation slide focusing on the conclusion of discussed few-shot learning (WSL) approaches. The slide has a white background with black text and colored bullet points. It is divided into two sections: 'Recent WSL approaches' and 'Our recommendations'. The first section critiques recent approaches, indicating they require clean samples and overestimate practicality, marked with a disappointed emoji. The second section provides actionable recommendations including reporting model selection criteria, using few-shot learning as baselines, and applying continuous fine-tuning (CFT). A green checkmark next to the latter emphasizes the recommendation. Additionally, there's a small, yellow, crossed-out traffic light icon, possibly suggesting caution or errors in current practices.</sample>

Both recipes suggest adding flavorings to the flour - strawberry jam for strawberry cake and cocoa powder for chocolate cake. At the bottom of the slide, there's a subtitle in yellow, stating that 'Abstract goal can be inherited by different real-life specific goals with multi-faceted constraints.' The room has a whiteboard in the background and appears organized. The color scheme is mostly neutral with red and black accents from the cake images and text.</sample>
    <sample id="318">So based on the example, the abstract language which is 'how to make a cake' can be inherited by different real-life specific goals with multi-facet constraints, such as using different flavor jams.</sample>
    <sample id="319">In this current work, to evaluate language models with planning capacity, the authors build a dataset for evaluating these models on language planning, specifically constrained language planning. The dataset uses WikiHow articles, which provide general plans with multiple steps, and artificially adds constraints to those plans. These constraints are divided into three types: modifier, method, and intent. The modifier constraint is something that describes the end objective. For example, 'make a cake' and 'make a chocolate cake' with 'chocolate' as the modifier. The method is something that describes the tool or the cost of achieving the goal. For example, 'make a cake' versus 'make a cake with an oven' where 'oven' is the method. Intent is any extra condition or demand for when completing the goal. For example, 'make a cake' for 'wedding.'</sample>
    <sample id="320">The video introduces a research topic on how large language models (LLMs) perform on constrained language planning. The voice-over explains the different types of constraints: modifiers, method, and intent. The slide displays the text in red and white, providing definitions and examples for each constraint type. For instance, modifiers constrain an abstract goal, like making a specific type of cake. Methods involve tools or processes for achieving the goal, such as using an oven. Intent adds an additional purpose beyond the initial goal, like making a cake for a wedding or diabetes patients. The background is a plain presentation slide, and text is clearly legible against it.

First, we started a very systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation.
So we studied what prompt is appropriate for the candidate pool, as well as the selection of prompts for translation.
We do this using best practices from the machine translation community.
To evaluate translation capabilities, this entails to do the best tests sets that are done in the community.
And compare this system to the most recent WMT submissions.
The WMT submissions is like the state of the art machine translation system currently available.
And this is also evaluated using expert-based human evaluation, or expert-based human judgment.
And we tried to provide some recommendations of which prompts should be selected in a given scenario.</sample>
    <sample id="542">The video shows a static image of a presentation slide titled 'Our contribution' with a bulleted list of points beneath.

    <sample id="723">Okay, so there are different groups in language. So in our first example, we have unmarked and marked groups. So unmarked groups are default, ordinary. And marked groups are those that differ from the default. For example, if we have a warrior, that's the unmarked group. But if we have a woman warrior, it's marked because it says that she's a warrior and she is a woman. And so, that's marked because we're saying, 'Okay, this is the default warrior person, and this is a specific kind that is different from the default warrior person.'</sample>

    <sample id="816">The solution that we propose is called EDAtt, Encoder-Decoder Attention. What we decided to do is to decide whether to emit or not to emit a partial translation based on where attention points to. So that's a trick, a word is emitted if the attention is not concentrated in one place, meaning that if the sum is below a threshold 'a' towards the last A speech frames, meaning that the received information is enough stable.</sample>
    <sample id="817">In the video, the speaker explains the concept of Encoder-Decoder Attention (EDAtt) to optimize speech translation accuracy. The solution involves evaluating attention patterns to decide whether to emit or omit partial translations. The speaker describes the threshold mechanism used to determine when attention should shift, emphasizing the importance of stable information. Attention is deemed concentrated by ensuring its sum in the speech frames is above a specific threshold. If below this threshold and oriented towards the last analyzed speech frame, it signals sufficient stability in the received information for translation. This framework is visualized through graphical representations on the slide, showing attention dynamics over speech frames.</sample>

    <sample id="869">So then we wanted to find out why matched prefixes affect LM judgements, and for this we looked at different levels of prefixing. We perturb context sentences in ways that preserve the relevant structure, and ask whether models are similarly sensitive to these sentences. So we have prefix or suffix adverbs, such as 'However, &lt;sent&gt;'. Then we have longer prefix adverbs like 'First and foremost, &lt;sent&gt;', and then we add a clause like 'Regardess of what X thinks about it, &lt;sent&gt;', or a quote 'Yesterday, X said &lt;sent&gt;'. You can see different types of sentences here. So we are interested in whether an additional prefix will change the acceptability of a sentence. We have a graph of input length on the x-axis, which is the length of the input given to the language model, in terms of the number of words in the sentence. And the y-axis is acceptability, which is the average prediction of acceptability. 0.0 means that the model thinks the sentence is unacceptable, 1.0 means that the model thinks it's acceptable. So here you can see that in all four situations, when you add words to the beginning of the sentence, the acceptability drops. But as you make the sentence longer the prediction shifts towards acceptance. But when you add words to the beginning of the sentence, the acceptability drops. But as you make the sentence longer, the prediction shifts towards acceptance.</sample>

The slide background is white with text and visuals primarily in black and blue. A central graphic depicts a stylized human head profile filled with a dotted blue pattern. Arrows extend from a thought bubble within the head, connecting to a belief denoted as 'I know that cigarettes could kill me,' and an action described as 'I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting today.' Each component leads to the word 'Dissonance,' illustrating cognitive dissonance where one's behavior conflicts with their beliefs. The lower part of the image includes a citation for the concept's source. Throughout the frames, the visual elements remain static, with no change in the environment or objects. The lighting is even, focusing attention on the textual information.</sample>
    <sample id="951">The video features a voice-over explaining a concept, likely part of an online lecture or educational session. The presenter discusses the definition and implications of cognitive dissonance, which is illustrated through textual information and diagrams on the screen. The static image shows a screen capture of a presentation slide titled 'What is Cognitive Dissonance?', defining it as 'two elements of cognition (i.e., thoughts, actions, beliefs) that are inconsistent.' It provides an example involving sequences of beliefs and actions related to smoking cigarettes. There's a block diagram depicting the process of cognitive dissonance and its resolution. The environment is a digital slide, suggesting an academic or informative context. No characters or live-action movements are present; it's purely informational. Text is primarily in blue and black, with certain words highlighted in red for emphasis. The slide cites a reference at the bottom for further reading.</sample>
    <sample id="952">In the video, the speaker is explaining the concept of cognitive dissonance, which refers to the mental discomfort or tension that results when a person holds two psychologically inconsistent ideas simultaneously. The speaker emphasizes the rarity of cognitive dissonance in language compared to other discourse relations. The video illustrates this concept through a visual example provided by Edie Harmon-Jones and Cindy Harmon-Jones. The example shows three sequential statements: the first statement acknowledges that cigarettes could kill the speaker, the second statement describes a contradictory action of smoking, and the third statement expresses a belief that the speaker might not keep their job without smoking. These statements highlight the dissonance between the speaker's beliefs and actions. The video presents this information with a combination of spoken explanation and visual aids, including text and a diagram, aimed at educating the audience on how cognitive dissonance manifests in linguistic communication. The focus is on understanding the psychological impact of holding conflicting ideas and the ways individuals may justify or rationalize such inconsistencies through language.</sample>

    <sample id="970">The video illustrates the process of the 'Probability of Rare-class Strategy' in active learning. A complex diagram shows the strategy in action with two main arrows looping back and forth between a 'Model' block and an 'Active Learning' block. These loops symbolize model updating and iterative cycles of active learning, where new data comes in to refine the model. The process begins with 'Initial modeling Transfer Learning' leading to the 'Cumulative-CIM' section, where steps like 'Extract', 'Retrain', 'Update' are depicted. To the right, an image metaphorically represents annotating the rare class as akin to finding a needle in a haystack, emphasizing the challenge of identifying rare patterns. Annotations cycle back into the model for reiteration.</sample>
    <sample id="971">In this slide, we present the Probability of Rare Class active learning strategy as an alternative to random sampling. The key idea is to acquire the rarest examples for annotation, as they are usually the most informative. This process is illustrated in three sequential images: initially, the annotation of a rare class is difficult within a haystack; by increasing the chance of the rare class, the task becomes easier, depicted as a haystack with significantly fewer instances. The slide also includes a diagram representing the cumulative confusion matrix (CCM) approach, showing a flow from 'cumulative CCM' to 'iterative (IT)' annotation. Both figures are outlined with dashed red boxes for emphasis. The diagram at the bottom details the cycle of active learning iteration, where the model retains or updates its understanding based on the new examples annotated and added to the training pool.</sample>
    <sample id="972">The video appears to consist of a series of slides from a presentation on a machine learning topic, specifically about an active learning strategy. In each frame, a bar chart is the focal point, titled 'Active Learning: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy'.

The graph shows several bars with varying shades of blue indicating different AUC values, with lighter shades representing lower AUCs and dark green showing the highest AUC of 0.75. The background is white with black text for clear readability. A cursor points at the AL-PoRC bar, highlighting its performance as more efficient compared to others like 'AL-Energy', 'AL-Config', and 'AL-CAL'. There's also a reference to a 'Baseline from scratch' with an AUC of 0.17.</sample>
    <sample id="974">The voice-over discusses a table comparing different active learning strategies, focusing on 'Probability-of-Rare-Class' (PRC). The table illustrates various metrics: 'Rare %', 'Time (s)', and 'Subj. diff.', for four strategies: RANDOM, ENTROPY, Coreset, CAL, and PRC. PRC shows the highest 'Rare %' (7.60) and 'Time (s)' (13.55) with a significant 'Subj. diff.' of 0.71, indicating cognitive dissonance with increased rarity. The speaker notes that while minimum annotation cost doesn't always lead to better models, increasing dissonance with PRC can enhance learning outcomes.</sample>

    <sample id="998">In the video titled 'ICLR 2022 Workshop Video 24 - Yuhao Zhang | Learning to Compose Semantic Interpretable Queries with Instruction Demonstration Learning', the focus is on the experiment settings involved in the research being discussed. The slide being referenced outlines the monolingual model setup, where the source language and target language are the same, with a focus on German-to-German translation. The process is demonstrated through a simple flowchart. During training, a German input undergoes a 'Few-shot' process to train the language model, which then converts this into SQL. During inference, a plain German input is put through the trained German model to output SQL. This experimental setup also includes a Monolingual Few-shot condition that involves training with only 10% of the training data. The setting aims to evaluate the models' effectiveness in these conditions. The visual elements are straightforward, featuring a blue and white color scheme for clarity.</sample>

    <sample id="1089">The video discusses the challenges and potential of leveraging large language models (LM) in computational social science. Initially, the video introduces a significant problem: most LM training datasets are skewed, with data from just a handful of websites accounting for the majority of the data. The speaker points out that while this may seem beneficial on the surface, it implies a risk where models might become biased or fail to generalize well to data from other websites. Subsequently, the video transitions to a visualization summarizing these findings from a study by Dodge et al. (2021). The speaker critiques this traditional approach, which he terms as the "pipeline of despair," where pretraining data is used to develop language models, which are then applied to downstream tasks. He argues that this method does not fully exploit the potential of models or adapt them to specific tasks effectively.</sample>
    <sample id="1090">The video presents a static slide with a flowchart detailing a process. The flowchart starts with 'Pretraining data' in a box and flows into 'Language models' with a curved arrow, indicating a relationship or process.

There is no apparent action or movement within the frames; they serve to convey information clearly and directly.</sample>
    <sample id="1152">The video clip is part of a presentation titled "Translation quality estimation for context-aware translation". On-screen text reveals research questions about translation, context usage, and model evaluation, followed by a focus on corpus-level metrics. A robot image symbolizes the use of a BLEU metric in evaluating translation outputs. The robot icon is overlaid with a red "no-entry" sign and the word "CONTEXT", highlighting the metric's limitation in considering context. To the right, a speaker's image is visible within a circular frame against a plain background. The frames change slightly, revealing subtle differences in the speaker's gaze direction but maintaining the consistent visual elements and theme about translation assessment metrics that ignore context.</sample>
    <sample id="1153">Now I'd like to introduce three corpus-level measures. First is the BLEU score, and this one does not consider context. For example, if you've been asked to translate 'How do we go to school?', and you respond with just 'Yes,' it will not consider the context of whether it was supposed to be a question. So, without context, the robot will think that that is a good answer. The next thing that I'd like to introduce is the COMET, which does consider context. So, the robot will consider the context and can understand what the question is about. The third thing is the F-measure, which is a standard measure used for summarization evaluation. But for our task, it does not consider context.</sample>
    <sample id="1154">The slide presents an illustration comparing three corpus-level metrics for machine translation.

    <sample id="1361">So we can see in sentence 12 and sentence 13, here's our first example the sentence 'Marg read it yesterday.' And we can see the dependency length for the subject is small. The dependency length for the date 'Yesterday' is small. The dependency length to 'it' is short as well. And the longest dependency of the sentence, the longest path, is from 'Marg' to 'it.' So that's the worst thing in the sentence. But if we rearrange our sentence, 'Marg read yesterday it,' you see now that the 'it' has a long dependency to our subject and to our date. So the word order minimizes these kinds of things, the dependency length for each word. It keeps everything as close together as it as possible. We see also in 14 and 15 that if you add adjectival clauses and things, we can keep the word order and keep the dependency paths short or you can make them longer if you want. For those long dependency lengths are bad. Right. So there are studies that would suggest that you shouldn't use long dependency lengths in order to avoid cognitive burden.</sample>
    <sample id="1362">The clip displays a slide from a presentation about 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)', a linguistic concept. There are three diagrams on the slide each representing a different example of sentence structure. The first two diagrams contrast to show a 'good' and a 'bad' sentence structure labeled accordingly. The 'good' structure has a shorter dependency length as indicated by the connecting lines between words. The third set of diagrams expands this concept showing two different arrangements of words with the same result of minimizing the dependency length; these are also marked as 'good'. The slide background is white with black text and lines. The diagrams feature simple graphics in black and labeled words in a grayish-blue tone. The word 'good' is in green, and 'bad' in red for emphasis. There is no discernible camera movement or change in lighting as this is a static presentation slide.</sample>
    <sample id="1363">The video presents a slide from a lecture discussing 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)' in linguistics. Various diagrams are illustrated on the slide, displaying dependency trees where words are connected by lines according to grammatical dependencies. The word 'read' remains the center of each tree, connected as the subject or object to other words like 'it' or 'yesterday.' The slide contrasts 'good' and 'bad' sentence structures based on the length of the dependencies. One sentence, 'I read it yesterday,' is labeled 'good' with shorter dependencies. Another sentence, 'I read yesterday it,' is labeled 'bad,' suggesting that the word order affects the sentence's quality or clarity. The background is plain white with black text and red for 'bad' and green for 'good.' There are no visible characters, environments, or changes throughout the frames.</sample>
    <sample id="1364">The video presents a series of graphics illustrating the Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) theory in linguistics. The first frame shows a diagram with a subject 'Mark', a verb 'read', and an object 'it yesterday', highlighted as a 'good' sentence with short dependency lengths represented by lines. The second and third frames repeat the initial frame with minor adjustments, but still label them as 'good'. In the subsequent frames, the 'bad' sentence is introduced with 'read' and 'yesterday' separated by 'it'. The last two frames present more complex sentences with an additional clause about a book, where dependencies are longer, but both are labeled 'good'. Throughout these frames, the color palette is simple, with black text on a white background and green or red labels indicating 'good' or 'bad' sentences. The style is educational, using visual aids to explain linguistic theory.</sample>
    <sample id="1365">In the video, the speaker delves into Dependency Length Minimization (DLM), explaining how word order minimizes dependency lengths. The screen shows a series of diagrams illustrating different sentence structures with dependencies marked. The focus shifts to various labeled sentences such as 'Marg read it yesterday' deemed 'good' due to minimized lengths, versus a 'bad' structure 'Marg read yesterday it.' The speaker discusses 'absolutely fascinating book about bees yesterday,' with the word 'absolutely' being the head of both 'this' and 'fascinating,' requiring longer spans and hence more complexity, especially when 'absolutely' is placed last. They conclude that placing shorter phrases first aids in minimizing dependency lengths.</sample>
    <sample id="1366">The video frames depict slides from a presentation titled 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)', focusing on linguistic patterns in language syntax. The slides illustrate two sentences with syntactic dependency trees, comparing 'good' and 'bad' examples. The top two slides show the sentence 'Marge read it yesterday' labeled as 'good' versus its rearranged form labeled 'bad', with arrows indicating syntactic dependencies. In the lower slides, another sentence 'Marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees yesterday' is presented in two forms, both labeled as 'good', yet with different dependency tree structures. The speaker, part of the video visible in the upper right corner, seems to be discussing the linguistic theory of dependency length minimization, explaining why certain word orders are preferred in language to minimize the length of dependencies. The room is dimly lit, focusing the viewer's attention on the brightly lit presentation screen. The graphics are clean and academic, using simple lines and text to convey information.</sample>
    <sample id="1367">The frames depict a presentation slide on 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM),' with a background of blue text on a light beige panel to the side, which is partially obscured. The slide's main content includes a title, four examples of sentence structures, and annotations indicating 'good' and 'bad' word order based on dependency length minimization. Each sentence structure is accompanied by a diagram showing dependency connections between words, illustrated with lines and arrows connecting the nouns to the verb 'read.' The diagrams are drawn on a white background with the sentences and annotations in black text. The word 'good' is highlighted in green, and 'bad' in red. There are two diagrams labeled 'good' and two labeled 'bad,' focusing on the sentence "I read a fascinating book about bees yesterday." The sentences use words like 'Marge,' 'read,' 'it,' 'yesterday,' 'this,' 'absolutely,' and 'fascinating book about bees yesterday.'</sample>
    <sample id="1368">In the given video, a lecture slide appears on screen, titled 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)'. The slide contains two diagrams illustrating sentence structures with their respective annotations. The first diagram shows the sentence 'Marge read it yesterday' with dependencies between words, labeled as 'good', indicating an optimal structure. The second diagram is labeled 'bad' and shows a different sentence structure. A cursor is seen navigating the slide. The background is a simple web page layout with a navigation menu at the top. The lighting is consistent, and the focus is mainly on the slide content. The colors are primarily black text on a white background with some red and green text highlighting certain keywords related to the diagrams' annotations.</sample>
    <sample id="1369">The frames depict a slide from a presentation with a blue header that reads 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)'. Below, four separate examples of sentences are displayed, demonstrating sentence structures with labels indicating whether they are 'good' or 'bad' based on word order and dependency length. The first example shows a sentence with the structure 'Merge read it yesterday,' labeled 'good.' The second shows a rearranged sentence 'Merge read yesterday it,' labeled 'bad.' The next two examples illustrate more complex sentences with the structures involving 'absolutely fascinating book about bees yesterday,' both labeled as 'good.' The text is in white against a black background. There are no characters or actions, merely static visual information presented.</sample>
    <sample id="1370">The video presents a slide explaining Dependency Length Minimization (DLM). The slide is the primary focus, with an infographic illustrating different sentence structures. It demonstrates the concept of word order minimizing the distance between dependents and their heads in a sentence, indicated as 'good' or 'bad' by the accompanying text. There are four examples, showcasing variations in sentence construction with lines connecting words to visualize dependencies. The color scheme is simple, with black text on a white background and colorful lines and labels. The DLM theory is being taught, as indicated by the presence of an instructor's name on the slide. Each example is visually distinct, using a combination of dashed and solid lines, and varying connector lengths to emphasize the theory's points.</sample>
    <sample id="1371">Now, I want to point out that with respect to dependencies, of course there are other kinds of connections in sentences. There's like subject-verb connections, object-noun connections, and a lot of them are going to be relatively short in terms of distance, so in terms of actual word tokens. Some of them might be long, like in very long relative clauses that are attached to a noun at the end of the sentence. But what is clear and is supported by a variety of research is there's a clear bias in word order towards, I mean just, on the face of it, minimizing, you know, like dependencies and so on. So, for example, suppose I have a sentence, a German sentence, where it says 'yesterday I read it.' And 'yesterday' is in a different position in the two sentences. If you have it with the object pronoun, like here, 'I read it yesterday,' and if you have it with the adverb, 'yes, the day before,' after the verb, then the dependency of the main clause is shorter in the first sentence. And there's a bias in word order to prefer that order, which is the first one, over the second one.</sample>
    <sample id="1372">The video frames all show a slide titled 'Conjunct Lengths in English'. Statistics about coordination are extracted from an enhanced version of the Penn Treebank by Marcus et al. 1993, and Frieser and Goldberd in 2016. The statistics highlight that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, as observed before. There is a tendency for this to grow with length difference, briefly noted in Gibson et al. in 1996, and further detailed in 88-90. However, this tendency is only present when the governor is on the left or absent, as demonstrated by the sentences 'I saw Bart and Lisa Homer come and sneeze' and 'not when it is on the right' (Ted and Ned laughed). The slide utilizes bullet points to list these observations and findings, with occasional cursor movements to emphasize certain parts of the text such as 'left conjuncts tend to be shorter', 'observed before', and 'length difference'. The cursor also moves to mention the Penn Treebank, Gibson et al.'s research, and the governor's position on the left. Throughout the frames, there are no significant changes in the visual elements or textual content, maintaining a consistent presentation of the information about conjunct lengths in English based on linguistic studies.</sample>
    <sample id="1373">The video titled 'Conjunct Lengths in English' delves into linguistic statistics drawn from an enhanced version of the Penn Treebank, as developed by Marcus et al. in 1993 and Fici and Goldberg in 2016. The presentation slides reveal that left conjuncts in English sentences tend to be shorter, a phenomenon observed before. The tendency amplifies with the length difference between conjuncts, a finding briefly noted by Gibson et al. between 1988 and 1990. However, this trend is conditional: it appears only when the governor is positioned on the left or absent. To illustrate this, two examples are provided: 'I saw Bort and Lisa Homer came and sneezed', and 'Ted and Ned laughed'. The second sentence, 'Ted and Ned laughed', exemplifies the scenario where the governor appears on the right side and is absent on the left, differing from the conditions where the statistical trend is pronounced. The slide employs bullet points, parenthetical explanations, and example sentences to convey its points, maintaining a focus on linguistic analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="1374">The video frames display a slide titled 'Conjunct Lengths in English.' It presents statistical findings about conjunct lengths extracted from an enhanced version of the Penn Treebank by Ficzer and Goldberg in 2016, referencing earlier work by Marcus et al. in 1993. The statistics show that left conjuncts tend to be shorter than right conjuncts, a pattern that intensifies with the difference in length. Specifically, this tends to occur when the "govern" word is on the left or absent. Examples are given: 'I saw Bert and Lisa Homer came and sneezed,' whereas 'Ted and Ned laughed,' shows this tendency is absent when 'govern' is on the right. The background of the slide is plain white with black text, and the title is in blue. The speaker is likely discussing linguistic patterns in English, comparing previous and recent studies.</sample>

The slide is titled 'Effect of Diverse Instructions on Instruction Tuning' and mentions that OFA finetuned on 5 instructions achieves much higher aggregated performance on all evaluation tasks and shows lower sensitivity. There's a table displayed, which seems to compare the aggregated performance and sensitivity when finetuned on a single instruction versus five instructions. The background is black with white text, highlighting key points in yellow. A person is partially visible on the right side of the screen, but no details can be inferred about the individual. No other objects or notable features are visible in the frames.</sample>
    <sample id="1556">The video captures a male speaker who seems to be presenting research findings related to model sensitivity, as indicated by the slide content. The slide header reads 'Effect of Fine-tuning Strategies on Model Sensitivity' and lists bullet points explaining how different strategies can reduce model sensitivity. Below the text, there's a bar graph labeled 'Figure 4: Model Sensitivity on Unseen Evaluation Tasks, Lower is better.' The graph compares model sensitivities on a scale from 0 to 40, with bars representing different model versions or methods, such as OE, OFA, OFA-Augmenter, and OFA-Attentioner. The graph visually demonstrates that the OE version has the highest sensitivity, while OFA-Attentioner has the lowest. The environment is a dark room, likely a lecture or seminar setting, and the focus is on the slide presentation. There's no significant action or object interaction, and the scene is static apart from the speaker's voice-over.</sample>
    <sample id="1557">The video presents a presentation slide titled 'Zero-Shot Performance on NLP Tasks,' which details the superiority of instruction tuning on Multitask in enhancing zero-shot performance across unseen Natural Language Processing tasks. Additionally, it highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning with MixedInstruct in preserving the capabilities originally gained from the Natural Instructions dataset. The slide includes a table listing models like OFA and InstructGPT alongside their respective zero-shot Rouge-L scores, measuring the model's performance. The scores range from 2.25 for OFA to 43.19 for InstructGPT on the Natural Instructions dataset. The slide uses a simple, readable font and a monochromatic color scheme for emphasis, ensuring the text and numerical data are clear and easily digestible against a solid dark background. The content suggests a scholarly or academic setting, focused on conveying technical results.</sample>
    <sample id="1558">The frames present a concluding slide from a presentation. It's a simple black background with white text and bullet points, indicating the summary of a research. The bullet points list a series of achievements: the creation of the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset, containing 62 tasks across 10 categories; significant improvement in the zero-shot capability of OFA via instruction tuning; exploration and demonstration of several transfer learning techniques and their benefits; and the design of a new metric sensitivity. The font is clear and easy to read, ensuring the information is the focal point. There are no characters or movement within these frames, just static textual information that likely serves as a recap or takeaway points from the content discussed in the video.</sample>
    <sample id="1559">The speaker is positioned front and center, addressing the audience with enthusiasm. The background is uniformly dark, focusing attention on the text overlay and QR code. The text states that a larger multimodal instruction tuning dataset, containing around 150 additional vision-language tasks, will soon be released. The QR code, prominently displayed below the text, is likely offering more information about this announcement or the related project. The image seems to include a part that resembles a logo, possibly of the project or organization responsible for the dataset. There are no discernible objects or colors in the scene apart from the white text and QR code against the black background, giving it a clean and straightforward visual presentation.</sample>
