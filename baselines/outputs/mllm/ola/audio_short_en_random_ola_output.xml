    <sample id="88">Hi my name is matthias lende man and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi set tagging and latent permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="89">This is joint work with my advisers alexander koller and ivan tifov.</sample>
    <sample id="90">Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training.</sample>
    <sample id="91">In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this. As usual, we have a training set of utterances in this case, the girl slept and Mary knew that the girl slept.</sample>
    <sample id="92">These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning.</sample>
    <sample id="93">In contrast to standard machine learning evaluation the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="94">In this example, the model has seen shallower recursion during training and is tested on an example with deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="95">Naive sequence-to-sequence models struggle with this kind of out-of-distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input.</sample>
    <sample id="96">In particular, they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output such as those that are color-coded in the example.</sample>
    <sample id="97">A popular method to address this is to integrate trees into the models.</sample>
    <sample id="98">The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="99">This works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow.</sample>
    <sample id="100">This can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols.</sample>
    <sample id="101">Obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures.</sample>
    <sample id="102">In this paper, we don't use trees and introduce a neural sequence-to-sequence model that directly models the correspondences between fragments of the input and fragments of the output.</sample>
    <sample id="103">For the first time we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without relying on trees.</sample>
    <sample id="104">Our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps.</sample>
    <sample id="105">First, we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="106">After the first step we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered.</sample>
    <sample id="107">That's why in the second step we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order.</sample>
    <sample id="108">We introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations this makes our approach quite flexible and expressive.</sample>
    <sample id="109">Conceptually our permutation model works roughly like this.</sample>
    <sample id="110">We go from left to right over the output and determine which multi-set token to put in every position for the first output position we simply select one as highlighted in red.</sample>
    <sample id="111">Then we jump to the next multi set token to determine the second token in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="112">We determine the third token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multi-set token we continue this process,</sample>
    <sample id="113">Until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once.</sample>
    <sample id="114">To give you a teaser of the experimental results here we compare our method with other treeless models on the cogs benchmark our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="115">Some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging, though.</sample>
    <sample id="116">In our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges.</sample>
    <sample id="117">First of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence, for a given token we don't know which multi-sequence it came from which poses a challenge for training.</sample>
    <sample id="118">In addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training.</sample>
    <sample id="119">Our permutation method is very flexible, but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard. That's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem.</sample>
    <sample id="120">We approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="121">If you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster.</sample>
    <sample id="122">The introduced framework quantifies the positionality by comparing annotations by demographic and comparing them to the models and datasets predictions and labels.</sample>
    <sample id="123">Hello, I am Dawe, a PhD student at Salzburg University in Germany. In this video I would like to present our recent work, weaker than you think, or critical look at weekly superstore loyalty.</sample>
    <sample id="124">This is joint work with chih yu shen, myroslav smolensky and geoff steffen and dittich klerk.</sample>
    <sample id="125">I'd like to begin with a brief introduction to weak supervision and weakly supervised learning.</sample>
    <sample id="126">In weak supervision, you do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristics rules, knowledge bases or low-quality crowdsourcing, as you illustrated in the figure on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="127">When compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect.</sample>
    <sample id="128">If we directly train neural networks on weakly labelled data, the neural networks tend to memorise the label noise and do not generalise.</sample>
    <sample id="129">In weakly-supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise so that the trained models still generalise well.</sample>
    <sample id="130">In recent works in wsl, so wsl stands for weekly supervised learning. a common claim is that people say that they only train models on the weekly labeled data and achieve high performance on clean test sets.</sample>
    <sample id="131">Technically, this claim is not wrong but there's a catch.</sample>
    <sample id="132">Which is that people do assume that there is an additional clean validation set available for model selection.</sample>
    <sample id="133">We cast doubt on this problem setting as this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weakly supervised learning but like an elephant in the room this necessity is often overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="134">The aforementioned topic is us to ask three research questions. First, is clean validation data necessary for wsl or can we maybe use a noisy validation set instead?</sample>
    <sample id="135">Second, if clean data is required or if clean data is mandatory for wsl to work then how many clean samples do we need? Finally, should we only use the clean samples for validation or are there better ways to utilize them?</sample>
    <sample id="136">We addressed these research questions in our work and our findings are as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="137">First, we find that interestingly recent wsl matters indeed require clean wide datasets to work properly.</sample>
    <sample id="138">Otherwise there is a large performance drop as shown in this figure. If there are no clean validation samples, then the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels.</sample>
    <sample id="139">Meaning that the training is pointless.</sample>
    <sample id="140">This indicates that wsl approaches actually require cleanly labelled data to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="141">Our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help wsl approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="142">Typically we only need twenty samples per class to attain high performance.</sample>
    <sample id="143">But that's not the end of the story because if we either way decide to access clean samples then training on them directly will even achieve better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="144">The right figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches which are directly applied on the clean data and wsl approaches which use the clean data for validation only.</sample>
    <sample id="145">As we can see if we have ten samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat wsl approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="146">Finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous wsl approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="147">As we can see from the figures, the wavenet model termed ftw initially underperforms more complicated wsl methods like cosine.</sample>
    <sample id="148">However, if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples then ftw performs equally well as other</sample>
    <sample id="149">So in practice, there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space.</sample>
    <sample id="150">To summarize, we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicability are heavily overestimated.</sample>
    <sample id="151">Our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="152">First, report the model selection criteria for example, report if the model selection is done well on clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Second, wsl approaches should be compared with few-shot learning baselines as opposed to work on clean samples. third, continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl.</sample>

    <sample id="313">Hi, I'm si yu yan from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="314">In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of guaranteed scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="315">Previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and show that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps.</sample>
    <sample id="316">However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities planning for the goals with specific goals, specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied.</sample>
    <sample id="317">In this paper, we define the problem of constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="318">Which impose different constraints on the goal of planning an abstract goal can be inherited by different real-life specific goals with multifaceted constraints a good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints</sample>
    <sample id="319">In this paper, we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="320">There is no data set of specific goals exists to spot our strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="321">We have to acquire this goal first as shown in the table we extend the abstract goal with multi-faceted constraints for humanizing the loop data acquisition use instruct cpt.</sample>
    <sample id="322">We sample one hundred specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="323">This table reports the overall accuracy of the results we find that all language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Then we conduct detailed analysis to investigate why learning models for</sample>
    <sample id="325">Results in the figure show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed.</sample>
    <sample id="326">We dig into more fine-grained topological categories of constraints defined in wakihara the heatmap in the figure shows that the planning performance of instruct gpt-3 varies considerably for goals of different categories.</sample>
    <sample id="327">Previous studies have shown that the output quality of language models falls in high variance leading to bad performance. Thus, we adopt the idea of over-generated z filter to improve generation quality.</sample>
    <sample id="328">We first show constraint types with examples for intratumor cpt and obtain specific goals based on the said abstract goals.</sample>
    <sample id="329">Then instruct gpt to generate case scripts for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="330">Next a filter model is developed to select the facial scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="331">We convert scripts and goals into structured gbt embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity.</sample>
    <sample id="332">In addition, we will observe the script that contains the key words of the target constraint we only keep the script if the target goal score is the highest in the goal set.</sample>
    <sample id="333">With our method instanced cbt can generate scripts of high quality our method greatly improves the plannability both in semantics completeness and faithfulness to the constraint</sample>
    <sample id="334">Since large language models are costly to deploy it's essential to enable language planning ability of smaller and specialized models creating data set is an essential step to this end</sample>
    <sample id="335">However, previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals and manual manual dataset annotation is expensive.</sample>
    <sample id="336">Thus, we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning data sets from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="337">We'll apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as code script.</sample>
    <sample id="338">In total we generate 55,000 specific golds with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sets. we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="339">This figure shows the constrained distribution of code script we find code script shows high homophones in the generated specific goals with code script we can train smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="340">We find that t5f finetune on the corpus can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable data sets.</sample>
    <sample id="341">In summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generation filter method for large language models.</sample>

    <sample id="371">Hello, i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc-eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai.</sample>
    <sample id="372">This work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor geno choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai.</sample>
    <sample id="373">Let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art.</sample>
    <sample id="374">The common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale.</sample>
    <sample id="375">These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality, but dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level.</sample>
    <sample id="376">One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses, using existing comparative or likert-scale methods.</sample>
    <sample id="377">However, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="378">Our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself.</sample>
    <sample id="379">We call this approach annotating behaviors in chat or abc eval in short we developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature.</sample>
    <sample id="380">Abc evo is capable of measuring the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors.</sample>
    <sample id="381">For example, abc e-vol measures the number of turns in which a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant.</sample>
    <sample id="382">Contradicts itself or its partner hallucinates incorrect facts or violates common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy.</sample>
    <sample id="383">To determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on one hundred human bot conversations per model using abc-eval.</sample>
    <sample id="384">For comparison, we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level, likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons.</sample>
    <sample id="385">For each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue, since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions.</sample>
    <sample id="386">From our analyses of these evaluation results we found that abc e-vol behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods as measured by inter-annotator agreement on a hundred doubly-labeled conversations.</sample>
    <sample id="387">In addition, abc eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods as shown by this simple linear regression analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="388">For example, you can see how measuring the proportion of turns with self and partner contradictions explains five percent and ten percent of conversation quality respectively while the average licker consistency scores explain only four percent or less.</sample>
    <sample id="389">Finally, we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression.</sample>
    <sample id="390">You can see how the combination of all abc eval metrics explains over twenty five percent of conversation quality and as you remove the metrics one at a time most of them result in losing a decent amount of information about the quality.</sample>
    <sample id="391">On the other hand, the combination of all turn-level lirkert metrics explains far less of the quality and fewer of these metrics carry unique information.</sample>
    <sample id="392">These reliable, informative and distinct abc-eval metrics enable us to evaluate conversational ai with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve.</sample>
    <sample id="393">You can see that in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified for example, the bots we tested have commonsense violations in around twenty percent of their responses.</sample>
    <sample id="394">They produce irrelevant information in around fifteen percent of the responses and they contradict themselves or their partner around ten percent of the time.</sample>
    <sample id="395">With the rapid pace of improvement in the field, many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however, this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models.</sample>
    <sample id="396">We hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="410">The author works with multiple modalities.</sample>
    <sample id="411">Hi, I am Manish Lavakar and I will present you our works on Dr. Bert, a robust pre-trained model in French for biomedical and clinical domain.</sample>
    <sample id="412">In this presentation, we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we will present the main contribution of our article.</sample>
    <sample id="413">We introduce the first biomedical model in french named doctor bert, which is based on roberta and trained on natos, which is a dataset of medical crawled data from the web.</sample>
    <sample id="414">We also introduce a comparison of models with multiple pre-training settings and data sources. Then we present our results on eleven biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in french.</sample>
    <sample id="415">And finally we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the models.</sample>
    <sample id="416">Since its release in 2018, bert has become one of the most effective approach to solve natural language processing tasks and offer huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextless methods such as word-to-vector, fasttext or word.</sample>
    <sample id="417">Since then, this model has been adapted to many other languages like in French with Camembert and other domains like biomedical with PubMed and Biobert and on clinical with ClinicalBERT but mostly in English.</sample>
    <sample id="418">Specialized model for other languages are scarce and are often based on continual pretraining due to the lack of in-domain data.</sample>
    <sample id="419">However, french didn't have any open source modern for biomedical until now.</sample>
    <sample id="420">We so we ask ourselves question about what is the most appropriate data sources for a wide range of usage and those crowd data are good substitution for clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="421">To answer this question we compare dr bert with our shubert model which is based on anonymised data obtained from the non-university hospitals that are our house.</sample>
    <sample id="422">Afterward, we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it four gigabyte, eight gigabyte or more?</sample>
    <sample id="423">To answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of doctor bert with seven gigabytes of natoos a second version of four gigabytes subset of natoos.</sample>
    <sample id="424">A first version of shubert which is a clinical model with four gigabytes of sentences taken from clinical notes and a final version of shubert with a mix of four gigabytes subset of natures and four gigabytes of clinical notes.</sample>
    <sample id="425">In addition to this comparison, we introduce three models trained on continual pretraining to analyze the impact of pretraining strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="426">One based on the weight of camembert and trained on four gigabits of data, another also based on camembert but trained this time on the four gigabytes of click-and-nots.</sample>
    <sample id="427">And finally one based on english biomedical model per berman bert and trained on four gigabytes subset of natures. in total we have seven models.</sample>
    <sample id="428">To evaluate our seven models, we gather which public and private downstream tasks such as named entity recognition classification, part-of-speech tagging and question answering.</sample>
    <sample id="429">This model are compared to six baseline models which are camembert Oscar 108 gigabyte, camembert Oscar four gigabyte, camembert Cissacnet four gigabyte, pommelet by Albert and clinique Albert.</sample>
    <sample id="430">Evaluation of highlight that model perform best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained.</sample>
    <sample id="431">However, we can obtain that data from we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translate into better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="432">In general, from scratch pre-training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="433">However, our experiment on continual pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of patrickbert trained on the four gigabyte subset of natsos shows comparable results to those obtained with dr. bert four gigabyte from scratch.</sample>
    <sample id="434">Which is not the case for the model based on camembert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues.</sample>
    <sample id="435">Finally, as a conclusion our proposed system offers better performance on nine of the eleven dnd tasks and surpasses globally the results of the generative model here camembert.</sample>
    <sample id="436">We also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well.</sample>
    <sample id="437">All the pre-trained models obtained from nato's are freely available and on hugingface, and all the training scripts are on our github repository.</sample>
    <sample id="438">So thank you for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchange at the post session in toronto.</sample>

    <sample id="537">Hello everyone, my name is i b lard and i will be giving a short review of the paper granting parallel translation assessing strategies and performance this is joint work with my colleagues from google translate.</sample>
    <sample id="538">Bam is a five hundred forty billion parameters large language model presented last year in 2022 it's trained on a large collection of text comprising seven hundred and eighty billion tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="539">The demo for flicker is achieved state of the art in hundreds of nlp tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="540">This work, we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="541">We evaluate the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the m2t community this involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="542">And we compared two state-of-the-art systems. so the best performing system is the davenport evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="543">We use state-of-the-art and new r m t metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results finally, we provide some recommendations for pre-selection strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="544">Prompting has a big influence on the performance of the of llms for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one shot prompting and provided two different prompts for for a given sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="545">The majority of sentences five hundred and sixteen out of one thousand the difference observed is of more than one blur points.</sample>
    <sample id="546">And this can go in extreme cases up to forty plot points. so it's important to select a good prompting strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="547">In our experiments we utilize for a fixed shot prompting strategy where we just mark its sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in.</sample>
    <sample id="548">In this example here where we perform translation from german into english, the german sentences the source sentences are marked with german colon and the english translations with english colon.</sample>
    <sample id="549">We saw that the actual form of the printing doesn't have a big influence in the case of serial short printing.</sample>
    <sample id="550">It's crucial for zero and one shot prompting and when we go as in our case to five shot prompting there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the of the prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="551">It's the examples that carry most of the</sample>
    <sample id="552">The summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="553">So it's important to select the examples from high quality translations in particular we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the turemt evaluations or the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="554">The dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the train data, that it's more nice and the results so a better performance when using the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="555">Nevertheless, specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the bann translations but bann comes pretty close to a commercial system. now in our case we chose to collaborate with google translate.</sample>
    <sample id="556">The insights that we gain from the umd analysis that we perform using the emq m framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="557">In particular the most common error are omission errors.</sample>
    <sample id="558">So it seems that palm chooses them to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are omitted in the translation.</sample>
    <sample id="559">However the style outward category for pan is lower than for the state of the art systems which is an additional signal</sample>
    <sample id="560">That parram provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="561">And that's it for this really short overview for more details please come my to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>

    <sample id="598">Coscript represents 55,000 scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="599">Hello everyone. I'm manchata and today my colleague martin and i are presenting our work that is must evaluate knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between miami university, mela and microsoft research.</sample>
    <sample id="600">National language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired by pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="601">Recent works in tasks like question answering show that models can use pre-trained time knowledge to solve the task.</sample>
    <sample id="602">But natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="603">For example in the sentence john saw the newly elected president on tv,</sample>
    <sample id="604">Pretraining parameters can contain information about what presidents do and what a tv is but they cannot reliably know who this instance-specific entity john is or who the new president is because the president might have changed since pretraining.</sample>
    <sample id="605">Therefore successful models for knowledge-intensive nlu tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-trained time and inference-time knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="606">In this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration.</sample>
    <sample id="607">We introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the data set with human study paths and established co-reference resolution models.</sample>
    <sample id="608">Here is an example from our data set servin is a judge kia is a baker servin and kia met at a park after a long day at work deciding cases in a law court he was happy to relax.</sample>
    <sample id="609">The task here is to identify the correct entity that the pronoun he refers to which in this case is servant.</sample>
    <sample id="610">The resolution of a given pronoun requires two types of information first entity specific knowledge such as serville is a judge and second background knowledge such as judges decide cases in law courts.</sample>
    <sample id="611">Generally, background knowledge is learned during the pre-training of large language models while entity-specific knowledge is typically observed at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="612">We vary the availability of these two pieces of information such that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="613">We have defined three settings of kipmos first with the tabulae cedant setting background pretraining where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pretraining time.</sample>
    <sample id="614">Second, there's a background both setting where background knowledge is available both at pre-training time and inference time. Lastly, the background inference setting where both knowledge types are available only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="615">This last setting is especially interesting since it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre-trained data of models for example because new occupations have developed since the time of pre-training.</sample>
    <sample id="616">Here's an example of how we control the availability of facts in two sources.</sample>
    <sample id="617">In the background pre-trained setting we assume that background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre-trained parameters in the fine-tuning context we provide the task-specific knowledge chesterfield as a politician.</sample>
    <sample id="618">In the background both setting we additionally provide not only anti-specific but also background knowledge about politicians in the intervened context.</sample>
    <sample id="619">In the background inferiority setting provide the fictional occupation meritocrat instead of politician because meritocracy is unlikely to be contained in a pre-trained</sample>
    <sample id="620">We evaluate the dataset both with human study participants and established coverage resolution models in this figure, we show the results of the best-performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-training setting.</sample>
    <sample id="621">Without task-specific training on kimbos both models do not perform well when trained on kimbos however both c2f and bird for c2f perform significantly better than the random choice.</sample>
    <sample id="622">This suggests that when trained on kaggle general question answering datasets models learn to exploit surface cues which are not useful when testing on kilt where such cues have been removed.</sample>
    <sample id="623">Additional experiences with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best-performing models cannot reliably integrate background knowledge provided only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="624">To summarize the main takeaways of our paper many coreference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources</sample>
    <sample id="625">Still even the best performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrated background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset in code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="626">The best alignment method for DEplain is the method of mass align.</sample>

    <sample id="629">The CoNLL++ dataset was created by collecting data from Reuters-News in 2020 and annotating it with the same CoNLL 2013 annotation guidelines.</sample>

    <sample id="669">Hello everyone. my name is zhuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conall two thousand and three named entity taggers still work well in two thousand and twenty three let's get started</sample>
    <sample id="670">Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the n er task,</sample>
    <sample id="671">We observe that models have been using conala two thousand and three to develop n e r for almost twenty years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalise to modern data?</sample>
    <sample id="672">And when we develop new tags, what is needed for good generalization?</sample>
    <sample id="673">At the same time, if we do observe poor generalization what causes the performance drop of these models?</sample>
    <sample id="674">To investigate these problems, we developed the conll plus plus dataset this is a dataset that we collected from rosters news from 2020 and then annotated them with the same conll 2013 annotation guidelines.</sample>
    <sample id="675">We then fine-tuned over twenty models on conll 2003 we evaluated them on both the conll o three test set and the conll plus plus test set,</sample>
    <sample id="676">And last but not least, we calculated the percentage change in f one to assess the generalization of each model.</sample>
    <sample id="677">So what is needed for a good generalization through our experiments, we found that there are three main ingredients that are needed.</sample>
    <sample id="678">The first one is the model architecture through our experiments, we found that the transformer models normally generalizes better to new data.</sample>
    <sample id="679">The second ingredient is the model size we found that usually larger models lead to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="680">Last but not least, we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task. here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also leads to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="681">To our next question what causes the performance drop of some models?</sample>
    <sample id="682">We had two hypotheses the first one is adaptive overfitting which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again and this is usually manifested as the dimension returns on the new test set.</sample>
    <sample id="683">The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data.</sample>
    <sample id="684">For adaptive overfitting we saw that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one.</sample>
    <sample id="685">This means that every unit of improvement that we made on kernel 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on kernel plus plus which means that there is no diminishing returns.</sample>
    <sample id="686">And this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed.</sample>
    <sample id="687">So what about temporal drift?</sample>
    <sample id="688">For temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap.</sample>
    <sample id="689">And this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift.</sample>
    <sample id="690">Our conclusion is that for good generalization we would need a better model architecture, larger model size as well as more fine-tuning examples. And these goals hand in hands we can't just have one ingredient but throughout the others.</sample>
    <sample id="691">At the same time we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conala 2013 has been used for over twenty years.</sample>
    <sample id="692">So going back to the question that you raised in the title of our paper do connell two thousand and three tags still work in twenty twenty three and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes.</sample>
    <sample id="693">We hope our paper causes more research on how to improve generalizations of the models.</sample>
    <sample id="694">And lastly, please make sure to check out our paper, our dataset and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me. thank you so much.</sample>

    <sample id="701">The authors created the human-written portrayals of target groups by analyzing the top words used to describe them, which included things like culture, tradition, proud, and exotic. These words defined these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguished them as different from the white norm.</sample>

    <sample id="704">Hi, I'm Myra. And today we'll be talking about our paper Marked Personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models. This work is done in collaboration with Essam Dermouche and Dan Jurafsky.</sample>
    <sample id="705">In recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or llms.</sample>
    <sample id="706">However, these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed data sets that are very time-consuming to curate.</sample>
    <sample id="707">And they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture a very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups.</sample>
    <sample id="708">Furthermore, most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique locus of harm.</sample>
    <sample id="709">To overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned llms are very good at responding to instructions and prompts.</sample>
    <sample id="710">So we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman. describe yourself.</sample>
    <sample id="711">And we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt.</sample>
    <sample id="712">So here are some example generations from GPT-4.</sample>
    <sample id="713">Immediately we see that while the outputs aren't overtly negative or toxic in the traditional sense of these words,</sample>
    <sample id="714">There are some interesting patterns,</sample>
    <sample id="715">The asian woman is depicted as unassuming the middle eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic and like referring to a mesmerizing region.</sample>
    <sample id="716">And both of the women of color personas make references to ancestry, while the white man persona has nothing of the sort.</sample>
    <sample id="717">To capture these patterns, our method has two parts the first one is generating these personas.</sample>
    <sample id="718">Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects finding that by giving it to human subjects, they also were able to surface racial stereotypes.</sample>
    <sample id="719">And also this enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human-written responses.</sample>
    <sample id="720">The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones which I'll elaborate on shortly.</sample>
    <sample id="721">The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon.</sample>
    <sample id="722">So the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness, which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that defers from that default is linguistically marked.</sample>
    <sample id="723">So for instance the word man or sorry, the word warrior is usually associated with men so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify one man warrior and mark the term with women.</sample>
    <sample id="724">And more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked.</sample>
    <sample id="725">So in our method, we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are.</sample>
    <sample id="726">And then we compare the personas using the fitting words method, which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group.</sample>
    <sample id="727">So for instance, for the personas of black women we would do fighting words and compare the law-goods ratios against both white personas and man personas because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups.</sample>
    <sample id="728">Now for some results. so first we use a lexicon of stereotypes and we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human-written ones.</sample>
    <sample id="729">However, when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon we find very different things.</sample>
    <sample id="730">So while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words the human-written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic.</sample>
    <sample id="731">So really just only the positive, or at least non-negative ones.</sample>
    <sample id="732">And in fact, this lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all so instead to do that, we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these positive seeming words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="733">In our analysis, we review how these seemingly positive court trials reflect harmful patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="734">First, for Mark groups the top words include things like culture, tradition, proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm.</sample>
    <sample id="735">This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups.</sample>
    <sample id="736">Furthermore, there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So, for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous.</sample>
    <sample id="737">Which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky.</sample>
    <sample id="738">Which connects to a long history of asian women being hyper-sexualized, seen as very docile and submissive, and so on.</sample>
    <sample id="739">And finally, for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient.</sample>
    <sample id="740">This connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype. and while it sounds like positive at first glance,</sample>
    <sample id="741">There's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles.</sample>
    <sample id="742">So rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles, it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms.</sample>
    <sample id="743">More broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="744">So based on these patterns, we conclude with three recommendations for model owners.</sample>
    <sample id="745">First, we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that.</sample>
    <sample id="746">And finally, there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="747">Because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird</sample>
    <sample id="748">Overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="749">We just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency.</sample>

    <sample id="775">Hello everyone, my name is Jing Wei Yi from the University of Science and Technology of China.</sample>
    <sample id="776">It's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about paper are you copy my model protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding and services with backdoor watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="777">Let's first introduce the background about embedding our services.</sample>
    <sample id="778">Currently large language models such as gpt-3, llama, pell are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation.</sample>
    <sample id="779">Embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="780">For example, openai offers a gbt-based embedding api.</sample>
    <sample id="781">However, recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services.</sample>
    <sample id="782">To protect the copyright of embedding services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="783">The watermark method need to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="784">Third, the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily.</sample>
    <sample id="785">Finally, the water mark need to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process.</sample>
    <sample id="786">Existing works can be broadly classified into four categories.</sample>
    <sample id="787">However, these methods are either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability.</sample>
    <sample id="788">Therefore, in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding ads.</sample>
    <sample id="789">Then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification.</sample>
    <sample id="790">Before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval.</sample>
    <sample id="791">We assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it.</sample>
    <sample id="792">In watermark injection, we first define a target embedding when a user sends a sentence to the provider service the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="793">The provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="794">The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence when the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="795">Copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="796">We first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set.</sample>
    <sample id="797">Then the provider requests embeddings from the steel service with the dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="798">The cosine and l2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed we compute the similarity difference between benign and backdoor datasets which is defined as delta cosine and delta l2.</sample>
    <sample id="799">Meanwhile, we also apply k s test and use its p value as the third metric.</sample>
    <sample id="800">We conduct experiments on four datasets ag news, mind, sst-2 and hraspam. We assume the provider apply wikitext dataset to count word frequency.</sample>
    <sample id="801">The results on four datasets show that our embedded marker can have great detection performance while keeping great utility for downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="802">We also validate the covertness of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences on the dataset weopca the legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="803">As shown in the figures, it's hard to distinguish between the back-to-back embeddings and normal embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="804">That's all, thank you. We'll come to discuss with us.</sample>
    <sample id="805">Hi, I'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and foundation brunno cassele and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matthew negri and marco turk.</sample>
    <sample id="806">What is simultaneous speech translation? simultaneous speech translation or simul st is the process of translating spoken language into a text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication.</sample>
    <sample id="807">And what are the problems of the current symbolist models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimised.</sample>
    <sample id="808">Long and complicated training procedures, for example training involving different optimisation objectives,</sample>
    <sample id="809">And training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example, training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on.</sample>
    <sample id="810">So what is our solution?</sample>
    <sample id="811">First to use already existing off-the-shelf models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for small-elt use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific, specific parameters.</sample>
    <sample id="812">And leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output, that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="813">Our solution is to propose add up or encode the decoder attention and it is a strategy for us to decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to.</sample>
    <sample id="814">A word is emitted if the tension is not concentrated, that is, its sum is below a certain threshold α towards the last lampas speech frames meaning that the received information isn't enough stable.</sample>
    <sample id="815">For example, if if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in german,</sample>
    <sample id="816">And we will look at the cross attention weights,</sample>
    <sample id="817">We'll see that the first two words points to the earliest received speech frames while the last word points to the last received speech frames, as well as lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="818">This means that the first two words will be omitted.</sample>
    <sample id="819">While since the sum of the crossed attention is above a certain threshold alpha we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk</sample>
    <sample id="820">If we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words, and we will look at those cross attention weights,</sample>
    <sample id="821">We will see that no word points to the last lambert speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="822">This means that these three words will be emitted.</sample>
    <sample id="823">If we look at the main results of that,</sample>
    <sample id="824">We'll plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measure the translation quality and average legibility.</sample>
    <sample id="825">That is the latency measure and we also consider the computational-aware average linking that accounts for the model's computational times to produce the output.</sample>
    <sample id="826">So we want our curve to be as high as possible on this plot.</sample>
    <sample id="827">But also we want that they are shifted on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="828">And we compare with popular strategies that are also applied to offline models, that are the whitkey strategy and the local agreement and we compare also with the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous translation.</sample>
    <sample id="829">These are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on german.</sample>
    <sample id="830">And we see that adot outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models, since their curves are shifted over the left.</sample>
    <sample id="831">And we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational wait time, that is the fastest strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="832">If you want to discover more results, read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous household to facilitate the reproducibility of our work. thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="838">53 tasks are used for training purposes and 9 tasks are used for testing purposes.</sample>
    <sample id="839">There are two authors involved in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="840">The authors conducted experiments on four datasets: AGNews, Mind, SST2 and ARSFM.</sample>
    <sample id="841">Hi, everyone. i'm kostya tsenah and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acsl twenty twenty three paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context.</sample>
    <sample id="842">A joint work with john gowther, arun muller, kancha mishra, karen fentress, roger levy and edina villam</sample>
    <sample id="843">So in this work, we revisit the minimal pair paradigm.</sample>
    <sample id="844">So the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like plump, syntax jim or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as grouse pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="845">And in this minimal pair paradigm, the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like a acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="846">And then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable</sample>
    <sample id="847">The current mpp pipeline basically doesn't allow us to evaluate models acceptance towards longer sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="848">These days, large language models are coming up with longer and longer context windows so it's crucial that we evaluate the model's acceptability throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="849">And that is what we are trying to do here. we're trying to revisit the npp pipeline by asking the model to evaluate acceptability on longer and longer sequences.</sample>
    <sample id="850">So that is the approach. so what we do is that we simulate these longer sequences, we revisit the datasets themselves and then we recreate sentences by choosing like acceptable or unacceptable sentences from those datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="851">For example, here we have chosen like a typical pair of grammaticality from the bllim data set from the adjunct island case.</sample>
    <sample id="852">And what we do is that to recreate like longer sequences and which are acceptable and which has the same matching of the grammatical structure we extract grammatical sentences from a giant island.</sample>
    <sample id="853">And then we add it as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query.</sample>
    <sample id="854">So we can do the same thing by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching and that could also like be used to test the model's acceptability.</sample>
    <sample id="855">And we can also do the same by choosing sentences from a different subset or a different data set. so that is what we call as the mismatch scenario.</sample>
    <sample id="856">So here the sentences are still coming from relevant datasets, but it's not from the same dataset that you're evaluating with and we can do the same for unacceptability cases.</sample>
    <sample id="857">Finally, we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain such as wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="858">So this will tell us like whether the models acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context.</sample>
    <sample id="859">Whether the context is coming from a different subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current little to the sentence that we are looking at.</sample>
    <sample id="860">So how does the model do the first we look at the wikipedia sentences which are completely irrelevant to the current query pair and there we find that the mpp judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="861">We increase the context length toward up to thousand and twenty four for to max out otp and gpt two models. and we saw here in the orange dot line the mpp judgments are relatively stable.</sample>
    <sample id="862">Now, what happens when we choose sentences from the same dataset?</sample>
    <sample id="863">So here we are choosing or creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blimp or syntax gen data set,</sample>
    <sample id="864">And there we see that the mpp judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable</sample>
    <sample id="865">But when we match the structure, that is when we choose the sentences from the same phenomena in blame person text jim,</sample>
    <sample id="866">We see a massive increase or a massive decrease in of the m p p judgement for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable.</sample>
    <sample id="867">Now this and this is very large. like this effect increases throughout the context length, and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context windows.</sample>
    <sample id="868">So why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much?</sample>
    <sample id="869">So we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations,</sample>
    <sample id="870">We find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change it course in terms of how it shows us them.</sample>
    <sample id="871">Basically, we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways.</sample>
    <sample id="872">That is, when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion.</sample>
    <sample id="873">So the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="874">And the mpp evaluation that the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="875">Please read our paper for more details of our experiments. thank you for listening.</sample>

    <sample id="948">Hello. My name is vasudha, and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acsl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge</sample>
    <sample id="949">We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent.</sample>
    <sample id="950">Such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance.</sample>
    <sample id="951">Further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consensual relationship.</sample>
    <sample id="952">While dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision making, they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of risk-of-relations.</sample>
    <sample id="953">So why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of dis agreement among people track trends and belief values and attitude changes in populations.</sample>
    <sample id="954">High cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better.</sample>
    <sample id="955">Studying dissonance in presentational language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarisation of vulnerable groups.</sample>
    <sample id="956">Finally, cognitive dissonance is important to understand personal cognitive styles of individuals and helps us understand decision-making processes better.</sample>
    <sample id="957">To the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource, we conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations. We used a dissonance first approach as seen in the flowchart here.</sample>
    <sample id="958">Tweets were parsed using a pittbyparser and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to the guidelines that are described in our paper.</sample>
    <sample id="959">As can be seen here, dissonance was only found in 3.5 percent of the annotated pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="960">On collecting around thousand examples of discourse unit pairs, we ran training for an initial classifier trained only on forty three examples of discnets to no surprise the classifier performed not much better than chance.</sample>
    <sample id="961">Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such data set we are facing the problem of absolute rarity.</sample>
    <sample id="962">To alleviate this, we experiment over combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissimilar samples can be collected over lesser annotation rounds, lowering the overall annotation cost while improving dissimilarity detection.</sample>
    <sample id="963">Since the initial model was not able to capture the dissidents class at all, we start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="964">We transfer from two different tasks topic independent disentanglement classification, a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic.</sample>
    <sample id="965">Called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and compression classes of pittibee since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them c e here</sample>
    <sample id="966">We find that on transferring the zero-shot performance on the annotated data set is already much better than chance, with the best with auc 0.62.</sample>
    <sample id="967">Further on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning of ce task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to co-start the active learning.</sample>
    <sample id="968">Next, we determine the best method to update a model with new data from each round of active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected.</sample>
    <sample id="969">Over the different strategies, we found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board.</sample>
    <sample id="970">Next, to improve the number of dissidents examples, we use a probability of real class strategy prc to select mostly the examples that are highly likely to be dissident by the current model at any round of a.</sample>
    <sample id="971">We compared this to the other state of the art, state of the art strategies that are commonly used in the community.</sample>
    <sample id="972">Find that the proposed prc strategy works better than other state-of-the-art strategies although the difference is small note that the performance is significantly lower for random</sample>
    <sample id="973">On further rounds of a l with two best strategies we improved distance classification au c to point seven five which is the best performance that we have on the task so far.</sample>
    <sample id="974">We also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and cost to annotators. We find that prc has the highest percentage of dissidents and works best for real class, however the annotators also find the examples difficult.</sample>
    <sample id="975">In summary, we find that prc is a simple a l strategy for rare class acquisition and cold-starting a l with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks and help significantly.</sample>
    <sample id="976">We also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative updates.</sample>

    <sample id="984">Hello everyone. My name is Yusen Zhang from the Penn State University. Today I'm going to present our work, Exemplar Crosslingual Semantic Parsing in Multiple Natural Languages and Vector Representations.</sample>
    <sample id="985">So semantic parsing is a task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus.</sample>
    <sample id="986">And cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations.</sample>
    <sample id="987">As shown in his figure we need to translate the query into multiple natural languages using neural models to sql, lambda or funql and so on.</sample>
    <sample id="988">Existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on datasets of limited tasks and applications, for instance,</sample>
    <sample id="989">There are leaks of coverage on certain natural language the chinese is missing and</sample>
    <sample id="990">Lack of coverage on certain minor repetitions.</sample>
    <sample id="991">The lateral coliculus is missing.</sample>
    <sample id="992">Or they are only evaluated on certain neural models for example there's only one single model to evaluate them.</sample>
    <sample id="993">So to this end, we propose exemplar for providing a uniform dataset exemplar for cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations.</sample>
    <sample id="994">It contains ninety datasets in various domains, five semantically parsing tasks, eight million representations and twenty two natural languages in fifteen language families.</sample>
    <sample id="995">And to better evaluate our benchmark, we considered the six settings for training and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="996">The first one is translate test we use google translate api to translate source to the target language then use monolingual model to train and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="997">And for example, we train the english model on english query and during inference, we translate the german query using api to english and then use the trained model to predict the sql.</sample>
    <sample id="998">And we'll also test monolingual model.</sample>
    <sample id="999">In this setting, the source language is the same as target language for example, german to german or english to english.</sample>
    <sample id="1000">We also test monolingual few-shot setting by training monolingual models with only ten percent of training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1001">And we test monolingual multilingual model which we train one but multilingual model for all languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1002">For example we put the german english chinese queries together to train a multilingual model and during inference we can use this model to</sample>
    <sample id="1003">Um to translate german queries or chinese query or etc.</sample>
    <sample id="1004">And we also consider crosslingual zero shot and few shot transfer. we train on one source language and transfer to another language.</sample>
    <sample id="1005">During training we're training on english query or the combination of english and german full shot queries to train a multilingual model to predict the sql output.</sample>
    <sample id="1006">And we also find many interesting results so regarding analysis of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models,</sample>
    <sample id="1007">Including encoder pdr which stands for multilingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xl-r plus pdr and bert plus pdr.</sample>
    <sample id="1008">And we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt five.</sample>
    <sample id="1009">Found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1010">And we evaluate on mt five and example xlm-r plus pdr on multilingual setting.</sample>
    <sample id="1011">We found that encoder-decoder or encoder-pdr can be improved by training in a mixture of various languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1012">And we found it is because most of the major natural languages can obtain performance gain except that english performance drops in seven datasets and only gains in three datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1013">I think this is known as curse of multilinguality.</sample>
    <sample id="1014">We also compared the cross-language performance gap.</sample>
    <sample id="1015">In this figure, the blue line is cross-lingual few-shot transfer. The orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the model-in-the-setting.</sample>
    <sample id="1016">We found that by comparing the green and orange line, we found that for zero shot setting, the crosslingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line, we found that few shot setting, the transfer gap is shortened rapidly.</sample>
    <sample id="1017">We also find some other interesting findings. for example encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1018">And we found multilingual language models such as codas and blue are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1019">To sum up, we build example or a unified benchmark for cross-language semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations.</sample>

    <sample id="1085">Hi, I'm shambhini, phd student in the university of washington. today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models.</sample>
    <sample id="1086">So language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data.</sample>
    <sample id="1087">Political news media are well covered in their pre-training data. according to a survey of the c four corpus, we can see that new york times, los angeles times, the guardian, huffington post, etc are well covered in language model training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1088">This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1089">So on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1090">To this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions.</sample>
    <sample id="1091">First, how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases?</sample>
    <sample id="1092">Secondly, how do language models with different politically-leaning actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications?</sample>
    <sample id="1093">So specifically, we first propose to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questioners such as the political compass test. this ensures us to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature.</sample>
    <sample id="1094">So some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political leanings. they occupy all four quadrants on the political compass,</sample>
    <sample id="1095">We can also see that gdp four is the most liberal language model of them all, and gdp series are generally more socially liberal than bert series and its variants.</sample>
    <sample id="1096">Secondly, we aim to investigate to what extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1097">So we could conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media, further divided into their political leaning.</sample>
    <sample id="1098">By further pre-training language models on such partisan corpora, we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift.</sample>
    <sample id="1099">For example, for roberta, further fine-tuning further trained on the left-leaning reddit corpus we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its</sample>
    <sample id="1100">In terms of its political biases,</sample>
    <sample id="1101">And we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarization that's prevalent in our modern society.</sample>
    <sample id="1102">So we divide pre-training corpora into pre forty fifth president of the united states and after forty fifth president of the united states. we separately pre-train language models on the two different temporal corpora.</sample>
    <sample id="1103">We can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017. so this indicates that language models can also pick up the like polarization in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1104">So last but not least, we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection two nlp applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications.</sample>
    <sample id="1105">So we see that if we investigate the per category performance, that is to say if we separate the performance into</sample>
    <sample id="1106">Different demographics or political leaning of news media, we can see a pattern that for example, for hate speech detection, left-leaning language models are better.</sample>
    <sample id="1107">At detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups,</sample>
    <sample id="1108">However, are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1109">And vice versa, rightly in language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men. however worse at detecting hate speech targeting at black, lgbtq plus and other minority communities.</sample>
    <sample id="1110">Similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning and vice versa.</sample>
    <sample id="1111">We further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political leanings,</sample>
    <sample id="1112">Do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social category there are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that.</sample>
    <sample id="1113">This indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models.</sample>
    <sample id="1114">For example, if a right-leaning language model were to be fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation and whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform,</sample>
    <sample id="1115">This would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control.</sample>
    <sample id="1116">So this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulting by language model political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="1117">So a little bit of discussion. we would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases. it's like between cilantro and kurbits,</sample>
    <sample id="1118">So if we do not sanitize political opinions in language model training data, the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, ultimately creating fairness issues.</sample>
    <sample id="1119">If we do try to sanitize somehow we will also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electrolyte electrolyte problem</sample>

    <sample id="1128">Hello, my name is Kaiyuan and I will be presenting our work titled When does translation require context? A data-driven multilingual exploration This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Franz, Emil Niu, Andrea F. Martinez, and Graham Neubig.</sample>
    <sample id="1129">So a lot of translations depend on context. for example, how would we translate mole in this sentence?</sample>
    <sample id="1130">Well, if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then Moore refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious, doctor then Moore refers to a birthmark.</sample>
    <sample id="1131">So depending on context, the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1132">However, evaluating how well models can translate cases like this is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus-level metrics like bleu unable to capture these translations.</sample>
    <sample id="1133">And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation.</sample>
    <sample id="1134">In this work, we try to answer these two questions first, when does translation require context? and second, how well do models handle these cases?</sample>
    <sample id="1135">To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context during translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1136">In the previous work, we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x.</sample>
    <sample id="1137">You can think of c x m i as the information gain from giving context to the model.</sample>
    <sample id="1138">In this work, we extend c x m i to point-wise c x m i which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level we can think of words that have high p c x m i as ones that require context for translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1139">Now we analyze words with high p six a mi to look for patterns between these words.</sample>
    <sample id="1140">And we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to fourteen different languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1141">We perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at parts of speech tags that have high means, psxmi.</sample>
    <sample id="1142">And this allows us to find, for example, dual pronouns in Arabic that have a root that begins with the letters p6mi and this can be explained because English doesn't have dual pronouns. So you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into Arabic.</sample>
    <sample id="1143">And similarly, we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose the appropriate verb form we then look at vocabulary items that have high p-sexism averages over all of its different occurrences.</sample>
    <sample id="1144">And this helps us identify cases like the one here where in chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document.</sample>
    <sample id="1145">And similarly we find that context is supported to transcribe in the right formality.</sample>
    <sample id="1146">And finally we look at different at individual tokens that have high psexmi and this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself but that's rather expressed in the instant structure such as ellipse resolution.</sample>
    <sample id="1147">So now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1148">For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse aware or muda tagger.</sample>
    <sample id="1149">We can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discursive phenomena.</sample>
    <sample id="1150">We then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpora that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the cognitively dependent examples that the muda tagger has identified.</sample>
    <sample id="1151">And finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate different models on the document level machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1152">First of all, when we use corpus-level metrics so for blue, we find that cognates-agnostic models have the best performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1153">But then if we use comet, context-aware models perform best and if we use word f measure, then models with or without context have comparable performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1154">This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone.</sample>
    <sample id="1155">Now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than the models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion.</sample>
    <sample id="1156">But these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like elipses, pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1157">We also compare different commercial systems, and our benchmarks shows that deep bel is usually more accurate than google translate for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1158">To summarize, we perform a data-driven analysis across fourteen language pairs to identify when translations require context.</sample>
    <sample id="1159">And then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation, which can help us identify which discourse phenomenon models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation.</sample>

    <sample id="1163">Hi. welcome to our presentation of deeplain a new corpus for german text normalization on the document level and on the sentence level.</sample>
    <sample id="1164">My name is regina sturgeon and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1165">Text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers.</sample>
    <sample id="1166">To train a text classification model, we require parallel pairs of text for example doc of documents or sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="1167">And the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german sentence and its translation into plain language.</sample>
    <sample id="1168">To simplify the sentence different techniques are possible as you can see in the example such as lexical substitution clostilation clostilation reordering or insertion of words.</sample>
    <sample id="1169">We now propose our new corpora to be trained because in the recent years there were some problems with existing corpora so for example these corpora here are too small to train a text classification model on.</sample>
    <sample id="1170">The other three models which i proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be over-evolved and their alignments.</sample>
    <sample id="1171">Therefore, we propose our new corpus de plain which is split into two subcorpora: de plain api and de plain web. de plain api is based on news texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1172">In the plane api, we aligned four hundred and eighty three documents all manually it results in roughly thirty thousand thirteen thousand parallel sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1173">For deep learning web this corpus includes different domains and we also align all of these seven hundred fifty documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1174">In total we result in thirty thousand four hundred fifty sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1175">We analyze our sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1176">As you can see here, the bible texts are much stronger simplified than for example the news text or the language learner texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1177">On all level regarding for example lexical simplification, structural simplification also overall level of simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1178">Furthermore, you can see that our deplain corpus has a high variety of different normalization transformations. so for example in the deplain api corpus we have much more reordering and word additions than we have in the deplain web corpus.</sample>
    <sample id="1179">On the other hand, in the web corpus, we have much more rephrasing.</sample>
    <sample id="1180">So let's now see what we can do with this corpus hello i am omar and now i will talk about the use cases for our data set deeplink so for the first use case we can evaluate automatic alignment methods</sample>
    <sample id="1181">In the recent years there has been a lot of alignment methods but in the context of machine translations,</sample>
    <sample id="1182">Where we have two parallel documents written in different languages and we want to extract alignments of sentences in both documents.</sample>
    <sample id="1183">But in our use case we are trying to extract alignments between sentences of two parallel documents having the same language, having the same content but they are on a different complexity level.</sample>
    <sample id="1184">And now as we have our dataset deep plain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1185">And we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1186">At the end we concluded that the best alignment, automatic alignment method to use for texts for German text simplification is the method of mass align.</sample>
    <sample id="1187">And you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1188">The second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1189">By fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text.</sample>
    <sample id="1190">We have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long impart to produce document-level simplifications.</sample>
    <sample id="1191">And we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence-level simplifications.</sample>
    <sample id="1192">You can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1193">We concluded that this, this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores.</sample>
    <sample id="1194">And we propose those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future.</sample>
    <sample id="1195">Thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank</sample>
    <sample id="1196">Hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entities scorer.</sample>
    <sample id="1197">My name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski, sylvia parati, and annie lewis.</sample>
    <sample id="1198">Our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling here, a user wants to select between one of these two songs.</sample>
    <sample id="1199">The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example by saying the name of the song easy on me or its position, the first.</sample>
    <sample id="1200">But sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation this would happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song.</sample>
    <sample id="1201">All the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to disambiguate.</sample>
    <sample id="1202">Or when the user wants to specify a preference here are some examples in direct references for example, the newer one or the song that's not energetic.</sample>
    <sample id="1203">This is an important problem in conversational systems and also for benchmarking llms' entity understanding.</sample>
    <sample id="1204">We're not aware of a public dataset a large-scale public dataset for the task so we collect one using crowd annotation our dataset covers three different domains music books and recipes</sample>
    <sample id="1205">Our data set collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion set.</sample>
    <sample id="1206">The cartoon has three speech bubbles in the first bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context</sample>
    <sample id="1207">In this in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling</sample>
    <sample id="1208">Which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect reference to select one of these entities for example the new</sample>
    <sample id="1209">We provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically but the third one is filled in by the annotator um the first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain</sample>
    <sample id="1210">The second one, which is the alternative question, is generated as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="1211">We always use a simple template. do you mean a or b where a and b are samples from wikipedia?</sample>
    <sample id="1212">Here are the different sampling methods we've used when we move higher in the list the entities become more similar to each other and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation.</sample>
    <sample id="1213">The first one is uniformed</sample>
    <sample id="1214">The second one is when the entities have similar titles. for example, two books with the name the retail.</sample>
    <sample id="1215">The third one is when they have similar descriptions on wikipedia and finally, when they have similar infoboxes or attributes on wikipedia for example the same genre or the same artist for</sample>
    <sample id="1216">When we show this alternative question to the amateurs, they know the name of these entities, but they don't necessarily know about the entity.</sample>
    <sample id="1217">So what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities for songs, we simply show a google search link to each song.</sample>
    <sample id="1218">And then ask the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song here's for example the google search result for the song easy</sample>
    <sample id="1219">For the recipes and books domain we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia so that annotators know how they look.</sample>
    <sample id="1220">Then we ask the annotators to pick one of these entities, for example here the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions.</sample>
    <sample id="1221">For example, the one with the piano music here are some examples from our data set for example, the one without words not the one with the twelve year old twelve year old boy or the fictional one or comes from azerbaijan and so</sample>
    <sample id="1222">The entities corpus has six thousand alternative questions across three domains and it has forty two thousand indirect referring expressions results with t five x large model are summarized below</sample>
    <sample id="1223">If the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators, then the accuracy is really high. it's around ninety two to ninety five percent but this is not realistic.</sample>
    <sample id="1224">If the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge, then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent, which is more realistic. For example, when the language model retrieves the background knowledge,</sample>
    <sample id="1225">If the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only sixty percent so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks</sample>

    <sample id="1229">Hi, everyone. i'm jenny, a first-year phd student at carnegie mellon university and today i'll be presenting your work on the positionality characterizing design by accessible datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="1230">This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the university of washington and the allen institute for ai, namely sebastian santiago, rohan lobrasso, katerina arniker and martin sap.</sample>
    <sample id="1231">So let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article, trying to remove toxic content.</sample>
    <sample id="1232">You might turn towards a popular api like perspective api for toxicity detection and this works really well if you're carl jones where perspective api is able to detect correctly toxic instances.</sample>
    <sample id="1233">But that's not really the case for didisha sharma where prospective apis are really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in indian contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="1234">This is an example of a design bias, where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations.</sample>
    <sample id="1235">Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the nlp researchers and model developers positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity and life experiences.</sample>
    <sample id="1236">This is a concept widely used in critical studies, specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces.</sample>
    <sample id="1237">And as a researcher, prepositionality can influence the research process and its outcomes and results because it can change the decisions that researchers make.</sample>
    <sample id="1238">And so one question that people might ask is, do datasets and models have positionality?</sample>
    <sample id="1239">And we're not trying to say that models and cells and data sets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences but they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others.</sample>
    <sample id="1240">So private work has suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality such as cultural gaps in models and datasets, as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1241">However these works really don't look at comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves.</sample>
    <sample id="1242">Studying model and dataset positionalities is increasingly important as nlp tasks become more subjective and socially oriented.</sample>
    <sample id="1243">And it's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind apis.</sample>
    <sample id="1244">So to study dataset and model positionality we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="1245">We do this through our framework n l. positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1246">Our framework works in two main steps.</sample>
    <sample id="1247">The first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators.</sample>
    <sample id="1248">And we opt to do this over looking at the demographics of original data sets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared.</sample>
    <sample id="1249">And so we opt to re-annotate data to get many annotations per instance and to get a rich set of demographic data.</sample>
    <sample id="1250">We then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using pearson's r correlation score.</sample>
    <sample id="1251">And thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and datasets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just inter-annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions.</sample>
    <sample id="1252">Our framework is largely enabled through lab in the wild an online crowdsourcing platform former hci collaborator.</sample>
    <sample id="1253">And lab in the wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to the platforms like mturk, which largely have participants from the us or india. and further, lab in the wild still is able to get high quality data.</sample>
    <sample id="1254">We host two tasks on lab of the wild, one of them being social acceptability and the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry dataset and then they'll rate how socially acceptable a situation is.</sample>
    <sample id="1255">Afterwards to stay engaged in the city, they can compare their responses to an ai and others.</sample>
    <sample id="1256">Then compared these annotations with social chemistry, delphi and gpd four.</sample>
    <sample id="1257">We then replicate a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task where they'll read an instance from data hate and write whether they think it's instance of hate speech.</sample>
    <sample id="1258">We then compared these annotations with dinah hate perspective api, rewriter api, hate roberta and gbd4 our study in the end amassed over sixteen thousand annotations from over a thousand annotators from eighty seven countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1259">So now we're better equipped to answer who do nlp datasets and models align with the most we find that there is positionality in nlp.</sample>
    <sample id="1260">For example, we find that datasets and models are most aligned to english speaking countries. so for the gpd four social acceptability analysis, we find that it's most aligned to confucian and english speaking countries we find that dine at hate is also most aligned to english speaking countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1261">We also find most additional alignment with people who have a college education. so for gpd four in the social acceptability task, we find that it's most aligned to people with a college education or graduate school education.</sample>
    <sample id="1262">And we find the same for dunne hate where it's most aligned to people with a college education.</sample>
    <sample id="1263">However when models and datasets are aligned to specific populations, some are inevitably left behind.</sample>
    <sample id="1264">An example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts we find this in the gpd four social acceptability task as well as the dianahate task analysis as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1265">So given that there is position in allied and lpl, what can we do about it?</sample>
    <sample id="1266">So we have a few recommendations for this. first one is keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process and the other is to do nlp research with the lens of perspectivism.</sample>
    <sample id="1267">Our third recommendation is to build specialized datasets and models within for specific communities. and a good example of this is the musakani initiative i mean, we want to emphasize that inclusive nlp isn't just making you know all technologies work for everyone.</sample>

    <sample id="1352">Hi, my name is adam zykrkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="1353">As you may know, there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. So for example in the universal dependencies, the structure of the coordinate coordination lisa bart and maggie,</sample>
    <sample id="1354">Is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case lisa</sample>
    <sample id="1355">Similar approaches assumed in igor milutin's meaning text theory where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct so these two approaches are asymmetric right they they single out one of the conjuncts</sample>
    <sample id="1356">Now there are also symmetric approaches to co-ordinate structures such as the prague approach, the conjunction headed approach, e.g. in prague dependency trees where co-ordinate structures are headed by the conjunction.</sample>
    <sample id="1357">So we get dependencies from end to all the conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1358">And finally there's also a multi-headed approach that's used for example in the cutson's word grammar.</sample>
    <sample id="1359">Where so to say all conduct is heads of the co-ordinate structures. so we get dependencies from the governor here laughs to all conduct separately these are barton's making</sample>
    <sample id="1360">Now, our aim in this paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these.</sample>
    <sample id="1361">The argument is based on the principle of dependence and minimization that are explained on the basis of these examples.</sample>
    <sample id="1362">So in english as you might as you might know direct objects prefer to be close to the verb while adjuncts may be further away right so march read it yesterday's fine because the direct object it is close to the verb</sample>
    <sample id="1363">While march read yesterday it is much worse right because here between the verb and the direct object there's an adjunct yesterday.</sample>
    <sample id="1364">However this effect may be ameliorated when when when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the agent</sample>
    <sample id="1365">This is illustrated here. so both these sentences are fine march read this absolutely fascinating book about the bcs today is okay the way instead of it we have this long and p.</sample>
    <sample id="1366">But it's also okay to say march ready yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about</sample>
    <sample id="1367">So the reason here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb,</sample>
    <sample id="1368">It satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization, which says that shorter shorter dependencies are preferred.</sample>
    <sample id="1369">So these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies, so the ones that are not constant among these two structures.</sample>
    <sample id="1370">So here we have a dependency from red to the adjunct of length seven, measured in words and from red to book of length four. so together it's eleven.</sample>
    <sample id="1371">When you move, when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes six. right. instead of eleven, six much shorter. that's why this sounds quite okay. right. it violates one principle but it satisfies another one.</sample>
    <sample id="1372">Okay so what we did, we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of pent of the pentry bank and see the paper why wouldn't use university dependencies.</sample>
    <sample id="1373">And these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter also salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables</sample>
    <sample id="1374">And also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length, the length difference.</sample>
    <sample id="1375">So when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of of the left short conjuncts</sample>
    <sample id="1376">But what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governors on the left are absent.</sample>
    <sample id="1377">So the governor is on the left in this example. i saw bart and lisa so is the governor is on the left,</sample>
    <sample id="1378">It's absent in the second example. homer came and sneezed. here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor. right? so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter than the more so the the bigger the difference between the two conjunct</sample>
    <sample id="1379">However when the governor on the right is here, lafayette governs the coordination between net this effect disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1380">So we show that by measuring length in characters, that's the first column in syllables, the middle column and in words, the right column. so i'll concentrate on the right one.</sample>
    <sample id="1381">What we see here is that when the governor is on the left,</sample>
    <sample id="1382">The tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in co ordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears</sample>
    <sample id="1383">And we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetrical structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these</sample>

    <sample id="1531">Hello everyone. My name is Ying, and my colleague Jiaqian and I will be presenting our research on multi-instruct: improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction-tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1532">So with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter- and data-efficient way.</sample>
    <sample id="1533">Recently, many studies have shown that instruction-tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1534">However, most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out.</sample>
    <sample id="1535">Therefore, in this work we want to investigate whether instruction-tuning or multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multi-modal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1536">Additionally, at the time of our research we discovered a considerable discrepancy in availability of instruction dataset between nlp and multi-modal.</sample>
    <sample id="1537">There exist more than one thousand and six hundred language-only instruction texts. However, there is no large-scale publicly available multi-modal instruction task. Therefore, this motivates us to build a multi-modal instruction-tuning dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1538">Here, we present MultiInstruct, the first multi-modal instruction-tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multi-modal tasks covering 10 broad categories.</sample>
    <sample id="1539">These tasks are derived from twenty one existing open source data set and each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1540">For investigating multi-modal instruction tuning on our proposed dataset, we take ofa, a unified multi-modal pre-training model as our base model. ofa uses a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens and the coordinate of a bounding box.</sample>
    <sample id="1541">Here we show some example instances from our MultiInstr dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1542">To unify the processing of various input and output data types.</sample>
    <sample id="1543">We follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format in which the input texts, images, instructions, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space.</sample>
    <sample id="1544">Okay, now I'm going to talk about multi-modal instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1545">So for the training dataset, we use fifty three tasks from NLP group for training and we sample ten thousand instances per task. For testing, we reserve the entire Commonsense Reasoning group for testing and we select additional five tasks from Wiki and the MeSciL group.</sample>
    <sample id="1546">We use all the instances in the test split for each task in addition, we randomly sample twenty tasks from the test split of natural instruction as the unseen task for nlp.</sample>
    <sample id="1547">So we use a pre-trained ofa large model as the base model during training, we make all the instances for all the tasks each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates.</sample>
    <sample id="1548">During test for each task, we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment.</sample>
    <sample id="1549">We report the mean and max performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1550">If the task is a multi-modal classification task we report accuracy if it's a multi-modal generation task we report rouge l for an lp task we report rouge l as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1551">We also introduced a additional evaluation metric called sensitivity. so this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variation in the wording of the instruction.</sample>
    <sample id="1552">Here is our main results. as we can see instruction tuning can significantly improve or is ofas performance on some multi-modal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1553">Also transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can benefit instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1554">Here we can see as the amount of task increased, the model achieve better performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1555">So we also did one experiment. we use one instruction versus five instruction. as we can see using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot.</sample>
    <sample id="1556">So this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategy on the model's sensitivity as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction datasets, the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to our original LLM model.</sample>
    <sample id="1557">We also can see transfer learning from the netron instruction dataset can help our f to achieve much better performance on the netron instruct dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1558">So overall, we propose the first large-scale multi-modal instruction-tuning data set which significantly improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning technique and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1559">So one more thing, we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional vision-language tasks and we will release them. So this is the QR code for our data and model. Thank you.</sample>
