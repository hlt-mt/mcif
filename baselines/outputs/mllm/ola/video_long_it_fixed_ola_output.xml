    <sample id="108">This paper examines the robustness of language model acceptability judgments to context. We present a series of experiments that demonstrate how language models can be influenced by the context in which they are evaluated, leading to inconsistent and unreliable judgments of sentence acceptability. Specifically, we show that language models can be misled by the presence or absence of certain words or phrases in the context, even when these words or phrases do not affect the grammatical correctness or semantic meaning of the sentence. This highlights the need for more nuanced and context-aware approaches to evaluating language models, as well as the importance of carefully controlling for contextual factors in experimental design. Overall, our results suggest that language model acceptability judgments should be treated with caution and that further research is needed to develop more reliable and robust methods for evaluating language models.</sample>
    <sample id="109">This paper presents a method for fine-tuning language models using only the output of the model itself, without any additional human input. The approach involves generating a set of instructions that are then used to guide the model's training process. These instructions are created by sampling from the model's own predictions and then filtering out those that do not make sense or are too repetitive. The resulting instructions are then used to train the model on a new dataset, which can lead to significant improvements in performance. The method is demonstrated on several popular language models, including BERT and RoBERTa, and shows promising results in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Overall, this work provides a new and powerful tool for improving the performance of language models without requiring significant human effort.</sample>

    <sample id="152">This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for classical philology, specifically in the context of the Digital Philology Lab at Heidelberg University. We present a case study on the application of LLMs to the analysis of ancient Greek texts, focusing on the task of identifying and classifying linguistic features such as verb forms, noun cases, and sentence structures.

Our approach involves fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a corpus of ancient Greek texts, and then using the model to generate predictions for unseen texts. We evaluate the performance of our model on a held-out test set, comparing it to traditional methods of linguistic analysis such as manual tagging and rule-based systems.

Our results show that LLMs can achieve high accuracy in identifying linguistic features, even when dealing with complex and ambiguous texts. We also find that LLMs can generalize well to new texts and languages, making them a promising tool for philological research.

Overall, this paper demonstrates the potential of LLMs for classical philology, and highlights the need for further research in this area. We believe that LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the field of philology, enabling scholars to analyze and understand ancient texts in ways that were previously impossible.</sample>

    <sample id="254">This paper presents a novel approach for document-level distant relation extraction using uncertainty-guided label denoising. The proposed method leverages the inherent uncertainty in the training data to improve the accuracy of distant relation extraction. Specifically, we introduce a label denoising module that iteratively refines the noisy labels in the training data by estimating the uncertainty of each label. The uncertainty is measured using a confidence score, which is computed based on the probability distribution of the label. By incorporating this uncertainty information into the training process, our method is able to better distinguish between true and false labels, leading to improved performance on distant relation extraction tasks. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on most of the datasets.</sample>

    <sample id="299">This paper presents a new approach to improving the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models by incorporating a minimax training framework. The traditional training methods for NLI models often rely on maximizing the accuracy on labeled datasets, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a minimax training framework that simultaneously optimizes two objectives: maximizing the accuracy on the labeled dataset and minimizing the worst-case loss on an adversarial dataset. This framework encourages the model to learn more robust features that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Our results suggest that the minimax training framework is a promising direction for improving the robustness of NLI models.</sample>

    <sample id="322">This paper presents a study on the impact of training data on the moral judgments made by text classifiers. We explore how different datasets, including Wikipedia and the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), influence the classifier's ability to distinguish between morally positive and negative texts. Our analysis reveals that the classifier's performance varies significantly depending on the dataset used for training. For instance, when trained on Wikipedia, the classifier tends to favor morally positive texts, while on COHA, it shows a more balanced approach. This suggests that the choice of training data can have a substantial effect on the classifier's moral leanings. Furthermore, we investigate the role of neutral texts in the training process and discuss their potential impact on the classifier's accuracy and fairness. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting training data to ensure that text classifiers make fair and unbiased judgments.</sample>

    <sample id="333">This paper presents INK, a method for injecting knowledge from a pre-trained KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) model into a machine translation system. The proposed approach leverages the semantic information captured by the KNN model to enhance the translation process. Specifically, INK uses the KNN model to generate candidate translations for each word in the source sentence based on its nearest neighbors in the target language. These candidate translations are then integrated into the machine translation system using a weighted voting mechanism. The weights are learned during training and reflect the relevance of each candidate translation to the original word. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that INK achieves significant improvements over the baseline machine translation system, particularly in terms of fluency and accuracy.</sample>

The proposed method leverages the semantic relations between words to learn their representations in a context-free manner. Specifically, we construct a graph where each node represents a word and each edge represents a semantic relation between two words. We then use a graph neural network to learn the representations of the nodes in the graph. The learned representations can be used as OOV word embeddings. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both classification accuracy and retrieval performance.</sample>

    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a novel approach to compositional generalization by utilizing multiset tagging and latent permutations. The method leverages the concept of multiset tags, which are sets of tags that can be used to describe the composition of a given input. By encoding these tags into a latent permutation space, the model can learn to generalize across different compositions while maintaining the underlying structure of the input.

The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving state-of-the-art performance in compositional generalization tasks. The results show that the model is able to generalize well to unseen compositions, even when the number of components in the input is varied.

The paper also discusses the theoretical foundations of the method, including the use of permutation invariant representations and the properties of multiset tags. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the model's performance on different datasets, highlighting its robustness and versatility.

Overall, this paper presents a significant contribution to the field of compositional generalization, offering a new perspective on how to approach this challenging problem. The proposed method has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about compositional generalization, enabling more accurate and efficient models for a wide range of applications.</sample>

    <sample id="350">Abstract: The Meaning of Superhuman NLU

This paper explores the concept of superhuman natural language understanding (NLU) and its implications for artificial intelligence. We begin by defining superhuman NLU as the ability of a machine to understand and process human language at a level surpassing that of the best human language experts. This is achieved through advanced machine learning algorithms and large-scale data processing.

We then delve into the current state of NLU technology, highlighting key advancements such as transformer models and deep learning techniques. These innovations have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of NLU systems, enabling them to handle complex linguistic tasks with unprecedented precision.

The paper also discusses the potential applications of superhuman NLU in various fields, including customer service, translation, and content analysis. However, we acknowledge the ethical concerns surrounding the development and deployment of such technology, emphasizing the need for responsible AI practices and transparency in decision-making processes.

Finally, we present our research on developing a superhuman NLU system using a combination of cutting-edge algorithms and extensive training data. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising performance, suggesting that we are on the cusp of achieving true superhuman NLU capabilities.</sample>
