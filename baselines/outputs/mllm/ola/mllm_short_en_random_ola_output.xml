    <sample id="88">Hi, my name is Matthias Lindemann and today I'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="89">This is joint work with my advisers Alexander Koller and Ivan Titov.</sample>
    <sample id="90">Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training.</sample>
    <sample id="91">In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this. As usual, we have a training set of utterances; in this case, the girl slept and Mary knew that the girl slept.</sample>
    <sample id="92">These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning.</sample>
    <sample id="93">In contrast to standard machine learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="94">In this example, the model has seen shallower recursion during training and is tested on an example with deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="95">Naive sequence-to-sequence models struggle with this kind of out-of-distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input.</sample>
    <sample id="96">In particular, they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output, such as those that are color-coded in the example.</sample>
    <sample id="97">Trees help a lot but... *girl x1; sleep. agent x2* *girl x1; sleep. agent x2* The girl slept.</sample>
    <sample id="98">The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="99">This works well, but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow.</sample>
    <sample id="100">This can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process. Typically, this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols.</sample>
    <sample id="101">Trees help a lot but... Trees need to be obtained: Pre/Post-processing logical forms Grammar-induction</sample>
    <sample id="102">Trees help a lot but... Trees nced to be obtained: Pre/Post-processing logical forms Grammar-induction For the first time, we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without trees.</sample>
    <sample id="103">For the first time, we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without relying on trees.</sample>
    <sample id="104">Our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps.</sample>
    <sample id="105">First, we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="106">After the first step, we have all the right tokens but they are not ordered.</sample>
    <sample id="107">That's why in the second step, we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order.</sample>
    <sample id="108">We introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations. This makes our approach quite flexible and expressive.</sample>
    <sample id="109">Permuting with "jumps" Permute Tag the girl slept</sample>
    <sample id="110">We go from left to right over the output and determine which multi-set token to put in every position. For the first output position, we simply select one as highlighted in red.</sample>
    <sample id="111">Then we jump to the next multi-set token to determine the second token in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="112">We determine the third token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multiset token. We continue this process</sample>
    <sample id="113">Until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once.</sample>
    <sample id="114">To give you a teaser of the experimental results, here we compare our method with other treeless models on the COGS benchmark. Our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="115">Some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging, though.</sample>
    <sample id="116">In our paper, we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges.</sample>
    <sample id="117">First of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data. As a consequence, for a given token we don't know which multi-set it came from, which poses a challenge for training.</sample>
    <sample id="118">In addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data, but the linguistically correct one is latent. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training.</sample>
    <sample id="119">Our permutation method is very flexible, but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is NP-hard. That's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem.</sample>
    <sample id="120">We approximate this with a GP friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="121">If you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges, please have a look at our paper or come to our poster.</sample>

    <sample id="123">Hello, I am Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University in Germany. In this video, I would like to present our recent work, Weaker Than You Think, a critical look at weakly supervised learning.</sample>
    <sample id="124">This is joint work with chao yu shen, marius mosbach and gus stephen and dietrich klawo.</sample>
    <sample id="125">Why weakly supervised learning? Weak supervision alleviates the annotation bottleneck. But weak labels are noisy! Noise memorization harms generalization. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) Train models that generalize well despite being trained on noisy data</sample>
    <sample id="126">In weak supervision, you do not manually label the data. Instead, we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristics, knowledge bases or low-quality crowdsourcing, as illustrated in the figure on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="127">Why weakly supervised learning? Weak supervision alleviates the annotation bottleneck. But weak labels are noisy! Noise memorization harms generalization. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) Train models that generalize well despite being trained on noisy data</sample>
    <sample id="128">If we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize.</sample>
    <sample id="129">Why weakly supervised learning? Weak supervision alleviates the annotation bottleneck. But weak labels are noisy! Noise memorization harms generalization. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) Train models that generalize well despite being trained on noisy data</sample>
    <sample id="130">In recent works in WSL. So, WSL stands for weakly supervised learning. A common claim is that people say that they only train models on the weakly labeled data and achieve high performance on clean test set.</sample>
    <sample id="131">A common claim in recent WSL works "We train models only on weakly supervised data and achieve an accuracy of XX%."</sample>
    <sample id="132">Which is that people do assume that there is an additional clean validation set available for model selection.</sample>
    <sample id="133">We can stop on this problem setting, as this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weakly supervised learning. But like an elephant in the room, this necessity is often overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="134">The aforementioned doubt is us to ask three research questions. First, is clean validation data necessary for WSL? Or can we maybe use a noisy validation set instead?</sample>
    <sample id="135">Second, if clean data is required or if clean data is mandatory for WSL to work, then how many clean samples do we need? Finally, should we only use the clean samples for validation or are there better ways to utilize them?</sample>
    <sample id="136">We addressed these research questions in our work, and our findings are as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="137">First, we find that interestingly recent WSL methods indeed require clean wide dataset samples to work properly.</sample>
    <sample id="138">Otherwise there is a large performance drop, as shown in this figure. If there are no clean validation samples, then the trained models cannot generalise beyond the original weak labels.</sample>
    <sample id="139">Meaning that the training is pointless.</sample>
    <sample id="140">This indicates that WSL approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="141">Our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="142">Typically, we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance.</sample>
    <sample id="143">But that's not the end of the story because if we either way decide to access clean samples then training on them directly will even achieve better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="144">The right figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches which are directly applied on the clean data and WSL approaches which use the clean data for validation only.</sample>
    <sample id="145">As we can see, if we have 10 samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat WSL approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="146">Finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="147">As we can see from the figures, the vanilla model termed FT w initially underperforms more complicated WSL methods like COSINE and ER. However, after CFT, FT w outperforms all other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="148">However, if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples, then FT w performs equally well as other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="149">So in practice there's no reason to choose more complex WSL methods which require more computation time and the disk space.</sample>
    <sample id="150">To summarize, we showed that recent WSL approaches require clean, manually annotated samples for them to work properly. Their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated.</sample>
    <sample id="151">Our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows:</sample>
    <sample id="152">First, report the model selection criteria. For example, report if the model selection is done well on clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Second, WSL approaches should be compared with few-shot learning baselines as opposed to clean samples. Third, continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL.</sample>

    <sample id="313">Hi, I'm Siu Yuan from Fudan University. I'm here to introduce our work: Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning.</sample>
    <sample id="314">In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of a script.</sample>
    <sample id="315">Previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and show that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps.</sample>
    <sample id="316">However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals of stereotypical activities. Planning for goals with specific goals, specific constraints such as making a chocolate cake still remains understudied.</sample>
    <sample id="317">Constrained Language Planning How to Make a Strawberry Cake? ...Add strawberry jams into the flour... How to Make a Chocolate Cake? ...Add cocoa powder into the flour... Object goal can be inherited by different real-life specific goals with multi-faceted constraints</sample>
    <sample id="318">which impose different constraints on the goal planning a abstract goal can be inherited by different real life specific goals with multi faceted constraints a good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints</sample>
    <sample id="319">In this paper, we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="320">There is no dataset of specific goals that exists to spot our starting point.</sample>
    <sample id="321">We have to acquire this goal first as shown in the table. We extend the abstract goals with multi-faceted constraints for human-in-the-loop data acquisition, use InstructGPT.</sample>
    <sample id="322">We sample 100 specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="323">This table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="324">What types of errors do LLMs usually make in this task?</sample>
    <sample id="325">What types of errors do LLMs usually make in this task? Semantic completeness (SE) in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints (FE) can not be guaranteed.</sample>
    <sample id="326">We dig into more fine-grained top-level categories of constraints defined in WikiHow. The heatmap in the figure shows that the planning performance of InstructGPTs varies considerably for goals of different categories.</sample>
    <sample id="327">Previous studies have shown that the output quality of language models falls in high variance, leading to bad performance. Thus, we adopt the idea of over-generated text filter to improve generation quality.</sample>
    <sample id="328">We first show constraint types with examples for intricated CP T and obtain specific goals based on the said abstract goals.</sample>
    <sample id="329">Then, instruct GPT to over-generate candidate scripts for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="330">Next, a filter model is developed to select the feasible scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="331">We convert scripts and goals into instruct-gpt embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity.</sample>
    <sample id="332">In addition, we will observe the script that contains the keywords of the target constraint. We only keep the script if the target goal score is the highest in the goal set.</sample>
    <sample id="333">With our method, InstructGPT can generate plans of higher quality by a large margin. Our method greatly improves the planning quality both in semantics completeness and faithfulness to the constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="334">Since large language models are costly to deploy, it's essential to enable language planning ability of smaller and specialized models. Creating a dataset is an essential step to this end.</sample>
    <sample id="335">However, previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals and manual manual dataset annotation is expensive.</sample>
    <sample id="336">Thus, we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning data sets from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="337">We apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning, named as CodeScript.</sample>
    <sample id="338">In total, we generate 55,000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sets. We ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="339">This figure shows the constraint distribution of CoScript. We find CoScript shows high heterogeneity and pluralism in the generated specific goals. With CoScript, we can train smaller but specialized models for constraint language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="340">We find that T5 fine-tuned on Coreset can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models, indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable data sets.</sample>
    <sample id="341">In summary, we established the constrained language planning problem. We evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop an over-generate-then-filter method for large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="342">We use a large language model to generate a high-quality script dataset (CoScript) for constrained language planning. We hope CoScript can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="371">Hello, I'm James Finch and I'm Sarah Finch. And today we'll tell you all about ABC-Eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI.</sample>
    <sample id="372">This work was done by the Emory NLP Lab led by Professor Jinho Choi at Emory University and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI.</sample>
    <sample id="373">But let's say that you just developed a dialog model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art.</sample>
    <sample id="374">The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a Likert scale.</sample>
    <sample id="375">These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality, but dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level.</sample>
    <sample id="376">One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality, such as the relevance of model responses, using existing comparative or Likert-scale methods.</sample>
    <sample id="377">However, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation.</sample>

    <sample id="412">In this presentation, we first talk about language modeling in healthcare. Then we will present the main contribution of our article.</sample>
    <sample id="413">We introduce the first biomedical model in French named DrBERT, which is based on RoBERTa and trained on NACHOS, which is a dataset of medical crawled data from the web.</sample>
    <sample id="414">We also introduce a comparison of models with multiple pre-training settings and data sources. Then, we present our results on eleven biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French.</sample>
    <sample id="415">And finally, we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the models.</sample>
    <sample id="416">Since its release in 2018, BERT has become one of the most effective approaches to solve natural language processing tasks and offer huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as word-to-vector, fasttext or word.</sample>
    <sample id="417">Since then, this model has been adapted to many other languages, like in French with Camembert and other domain like biomedical with PumMedBERT and BioBERT and on clinical with ClinicalBERT but mostly in English.</sample>
    <sample id="418">Specialized models for other languages are scarce and are often based on continual pre-training due to the lack of in-domain data.</sample>
    <sample id="419">However, French did not have any open-source model for biomedical domain until now.</sample>
    <sample id="420">We so we ask ourselves question about what is the most appropriate data sources for a wide range of usage and those crowd data are good substitution for clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="421">To answer this question, we compare Dr. Bert with our Shubert model, which is based on anonymized data obtained from the Nanterre University Hospital data warehouse.</sample>
    <sample id="422">Comparison of pre-training strategies and data sources Evaluation of the impact of public and private medical data sources in comparable data sizes NACHOS: A 1.1 words open-source diverse medical domains, heterogeneous data source from diverse medical domains, styles natures, and University Hospital data warehouse a private dataset of sentences taken from 1.7M anonymized medical records extracted from the Nantes Comparison of learning strategies From scratch with full model construction Continual pre-training using an existing pre-trained model Here, CamemBERT, a French generic model, and PubMedBERT, a English pre-trained model, NACHOS, NBW Comparison of pre-training strategies and data sources</sample>
    <sample id="423">To answer this question, we first train and compare four from-scratch models: a first version of DrBERT with 7GB of NACHOS, a second version of 4GB subset of NACHOS,</sample>
    <sample id="424">A first version of Shubert, which is a clinical model, with four gigabytes of sentences taken from clinical notes. And a final version of Shubert, with a mix of four gigabytes subset of NACHOS and four gigabytes of clinical notes.</sample>
    <sample id="425">In addition to this comparison, we introduce three models trained on continual pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="426">One based on the weight of camembert and train on four gigabytes subset of nachos another also based on camembert but trained this time on the four gigabytes of clinkin notes.</sample>
    <sample id="427">And finally, one based on English biomedical model permed Bert and trained on four gigabytes subset of natasha. In total, we have seven models.</sample>
    <sample id="428">To evaluate our seven models, we use a variety of public and private datasets tasks such as named entity recognition, classification, part-of-speech tagging, and question answering.</sample>
    <sample id="429">This model are compared to six baseline models which are Camembert Oscar 108 GB, Camembert Oscar 4 GB, Camembert CUNet 4 GB, DeBERTa by Albert and ClinicalBERT.</sample>
    <sample id="430">Evaluation of highlight that model perform best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained.</sample>
    <sample id="431">However, we can obtain the data from we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile. We also observe that using more data translate into better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="432">In general, from scratch pre-training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="433">However, our experiment on continual pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of camembert, trained on the four gigabyte subset of natsc, show comparable results to those obtained with drbert four gigabyte from scratch.</sample>
    <sample id="434">Which is not the case for the model based on Camembert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues.</sample>
    <sample id="435">Finally, as a conclusion our proposed system offers better performance on nine of the eleven downstream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here camembert.</sample>
    <sample id="436">We also observe that specialized data is better, more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well.</sample>
    <sample id="437">All the pretrained models obtained from NACHOS are freely available on Hugging Face and all the training scripts are on our GitHub repository.</sample>

    <sample id="537">Hello everyone, my name is Ibilard and I will be giving a short overview of the paper Prompting for Translation: Assessing Strategies and Performance. This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate.</sample>
    <sample id="538">PalM is a 540 billion parameter large language model presented last year in 2022. It's trained on a large collection of text comprising 780 billion tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="539">PalM: Pathways Language Model Chowdery et al, 2022 arXiv:2204.02311. 540B parameters. Trained on 780B tokens. Densely activated. 6144 TPU v4 chips. SOTA in hundreds of NLP benchmarks. 62 billion parameters</sample>
    <sample id="540">Our contribution First systematic study of LLM prompting for MT. Evaluate both the candidate pool as well as selection strategy. Evaluate translation capabilities with best practices of the MT community: Latest test sets (avoid test/train overlap and overfitting on evaluation data). Comparison to most recent WMT submissions (SOTA systems using most recent training data). SOTA MT metrics (better correlation with human judgements). Expert-based human evaluation (more robust than crowd workers). Recommendation for prompt selection strategies</sample>
    <sample id="541">We evaluated the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the MT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="542">And we compared two state-of-the-art systems. So the best-performing system is the WMT evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="543">We use state-of-the-art and new LLM metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="544">Prompts have a big impact on translation quality Select two random prompts for each sentence. Compute BLEURT for each sentence-prompt pair. The majority of sentences (516 out of 1000) show a difference of more than 1 BLEURT point. The difference can go up to 40 BLEURT points!</sample>
    <sample id="545">The majority of sentences 516 out of 1000 the difference is of more than one BLUR points</sample>
    <sample id="546">and this can go in extreme cases up to 40 BLER points. so it's important to select that good prompting strategy</sample>
    <sample id="547">In our experiments, we evaluate for a few shot prompting strategy where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in.</sample>
    <sample id="548">In this example here, where we perform translation from German into English, the German sentences, the source sentences are marked with German colon and the English translations with English colon.</sample>
    <sample id="549">We saw that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have a big influence in the case of several-shot prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="550">It's crucial for zero and one shot prompting and when we go as in our case to five shot prompting there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the of the prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="551">It's the examples that carry most of the of the weight.</sample>
    <sample id="552">Experimental results example quality is more important than similarity to source sentence specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage. PalM close to Google Translate insights from MQG fluency of PalM comparable to SOTA accuracy scores generally lower dominated by accuracy omission style awkward generally lower for PalM Google</sample>
    <sample id="553">So it's important to select the examples from high quality translations. In particular, we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the WMT evaluations or the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="554">Experimental Results Example quality is more important than similarity to source sentence. Specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage. PaLM close to Google Translate. Insights from MQM: Fluency of PaLM comparable to SOTA. Accuracy scores generally lower. Dominated by "Accuracy/Omission" "Style/Awesome" generally lower for PaLM.</sample>
    <sample id="555">Experimental results example quality is more important than similarity to source sentence specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage. PalM close to Google Translate insights from MQM fluency of palm comparable to SOTA accuracy scores generally lower dominated by accuracy omission style awkward generally lower for palm.</sample>
    <sample id="556">The insights that we gain from the evaluation that we perform using the MQM framework is that the fluency of PaLM is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but the main difference comes from the accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="557">Experimental Results Example quality is more important than similarity to source sentence. Specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage. PaLM close to Google Translate. Insights from MQM Fluency of PaLM comparable to SOTA. Accuracy scores generally lower. Dominated by "Accuracy/Omission" Style/Awkward" generally lower for PaLM.</sample>
    <sample id="558">So it seems that palm chooses them to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are omitted in the translation.</sample>
    <sample id="559">However, the style awkward category for PaLM is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems, which is an additional signal.</sample>
    <sample id="560">that param provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy</sample>
    <sample id="561">and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come my to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>

    <sample id="599">Hello everyone. I'm Manjata and today my co-author Martin and I are presenting our work, the KITMUS test: evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources. This work is a collaboration between McGill University, Mila and Microsoft Research.</sample>
    <sample id="600">NLU models draw on multiple knowledge sources Knowledge in Parameters (pretrain-time knowledge) Knowledge in Context (inference-time knowledge) NLU Model</sample>
    <sample id="601">NLU models draw on multiple knowledge sources Knowledge in Parameters (pretrain-time knowledge) Knowledge in Context (inference-time knowledge) NLU Model</sample>
    <sample id="602">But natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="603">John saw the newly elected president on TV. What presidents do What a TV Who is John? Who is the new president? pre-train time knowledge</sample>
    <sample id="604">Pretraining parameters can contain information about what presidents do and what a TV is but they cannot reliably know who this instance-specific entity John is or who the new president is because the president might have changed since pretraining.</sample>
    <sample id="605">Therefore, successful models for knowledge-intensive NLU tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-training time and inference-time knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="606">In this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration.</sample>
    <sample id="607">We introduce a coreference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources. We evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established coreference resolution models.</sample>
    <sample id="608">Here is an example from our dataset. Servin is a judge. Kea is a baker. Servin and Kea met at a park. After a long day at work deciding cases in a law court, he was happy to relax.</sample>
    <sample id="609">Servin is a judge. Kea is a baker. Servin and Kea met at a park. After a long day at work deciding cases in a law court, he was happy to relax. [Answer: Servin]</sample>
    <sample id="610">The resolution of a given pronoun requires two types of information. First, entity-specific knowledge such as Servin is a judge. And second, background knowledge such as judges decide cases in law courts.</sample>
    <sample id="611">KITMUS Test Suite Servin is a judge. Kea is a baker. Servin and Kea met at a park. After a long day at work deciding cases in a law court, he was happy to relax. (Answer: Servin) 1) Entity-specific knowledge 2) Background knowledge inference-time knowledge pre-train-time knowledge</sample>
    <sample id="612">We vary the availability of these two pieces of information such that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="613">We have defined three settings of KIMUs first with the tablica setting background pre-train where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pre-training time</sample>
    <sample id="614">second there's the background both setting where background knowledge is available both at pretraining time and inference time lastly the background inference setting where both knowledge types are available only at inference time</sample>
    <sample id="615">This last setting is especially interesting since it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre-trained data of models. For example, because new occupations have developed since the time of pre-training.</sample>
    <sample id="616">Here's an example of how we can control the availability of facts in two sources. Background-Pretrain Background-Both Background-Inference Politicians seek elected seats in government. Chichester is a politician. The work of a politician is seeking an elected seat in government. The work of a politician is emitting smartly.</sample>
    <sample id="617">in the background pretrain setting we assume that the background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pretrain parameters in the inference context we provide the ant-specific knowledge chichester is a politician</sample>
    <sample id="618">In the background-both setting, we additionally provide not only anti-specific, but also background knowledge about politicians in the intervened context.</sample>
    <sample id="619">In the background-inference setting, we provide the fictional occupation "miretuer" instead of "politician" because miretuer is unlikely to be contained in the pre-training</sample>
    <sample id="620">Background - Pre-train We evaluate the dataset both with human study participants and established question-answering models. In this figure we show the results of the best-performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-train setting. Task-specific training is necessary for knowledge integration 13</sample>
    <sample id="621">Background - Pre-train Without task-specific training on KidCoS, both models do not perform well. More trained on KidCoS, however, both C2F and BERT4Coref perform significantly better than the random choice.</sample>
    <sample id="622">This suggests that when trained on general QA reference datasets, models learn to exploit surface cues which are not useful when testing on KidCo as such cues have been removed.</sample>
    <sample id="623">Background-Inference Models struggle to integrate inference-time background knowledge</sample>
    <sample id="624">To summarize the main takeaways of our paper, many reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training. However, with task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="625">Conclusion Main Takeaways: 1. Many models seem unable to reason over knowledge from multiple sources (pretrain-time and inference-time knowledge) 2. Task-specific training is necessary for knowledge integration 3.

    <sample id="669">hello everyone my name is true hung today i'm going to present our paper do conal 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started</sample>
    <sample id="670">Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task, or the NER task.</sample>
    <sample id="671">We observe that models have been using CoNLL-2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data?</sample>
    <sample id="672">Named Entity Recognition &amp; Generalization Models have been using CoNLL-2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years Can these models generalize to modern data? What is needed for good generalization? Georgia Tech</sample>
    <sample id="673">At the same time, if we do observe poor generalization, what causes the performance drop of these models?</sample>
    <sample id="674">To investigate these problems, we develop the conll++ dataset this is a dataset that we collected from Reuters News from 2020 and then annotated them with the same conll-2003 annotation guidelines.</sample>
    <sample id="675">We then fine-tuned over 20 models on CoNLL-2003. We evaluated them on both the CoNLL-2003 test set and the CoNLL++ test set.</sample>
    <sample id="676">And last but not least, we calculated the percentage change in F1 to assess the generalization of each model.</sample>
    <sample id="677">so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that there are three main ingredients that are needed</sample>
    <sample id="678">What is needed for good generalization? Model architecture Transformer models generalize better to new data.</sample>
    <sample id="679">The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually larger models lead to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="680">And last but not least, we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task. Here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also leads to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="681">What causes the performance drop of some models?</sample>
    <sample id="682">We had two hypotheses. The first one is adaptive overfitting, which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again and this is usually manifested as the diminution returns on the new test set.</sample>
    <sample id="683">The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data.</sample>
    <sample id="684">What Causes Performance Drop? Adaptive overfitting? Temporal drift?</sample>
    <sample id="685">This means that every unit of improvement that we made on CoNLL 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on CoNLL++ which means that there is no diminishing returns.</sample>
    <sample id="686">And this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed.</sample>
    <sample id="687">What causes performance drop? Adaptive overfitting? No diminishing returns Not observed Temporal drift? CbLL-2000 F1 Score CbLL-2000 F1 Score</sample>
    <sample id="688">For temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap.</sample>
    <sample id="689">And this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift.</sample>
    <sample id="690">Conclusion For a good generalization, we need: Better model architecture Larger model size More fine-tuning examples These goals hand in hands. We can't just have one ingredient but throughout the others.</sample>
    <sample id="691">At the same time, we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2013 has been used for over 20 years.</sample>
    <sample id="692">So going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper, do conll-2003 taggers still work in 2023? And we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes.</sample>
    <sample id="693">We hope our paper causes for more research on how to improve generalizations of the models.</sample>

    <sample id="704">Hi, I'm Myra and today I'll be talking about our paper Marked Personas: Using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models. This work is done in collaboration with Esin Durmus and Dan Jurafsky.</sample>
    <sample id="705">In recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs).</sample>
    <sample id="706">However, these measures have various limitations. They usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate.</sample>
    <sample id="707">And they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes, meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts. Or they simply capture a very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups.</sample>
    <sample id="708">Furthermore, most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality, which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique low-sy of harm.</sample>
    <sample id="709">To overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned LLMs are very good at responding to instructions in prompts.</sample>
    <sample id="710">So we can ask the model to generate a persona, which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like, imagine you are an Asian woman. Describe yourself.</sample>
    <sample id="711">And we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt.</sample>
    <sample id="712">Output: Persona Examples (GPT-4) Asian woman The almond-shaped eyes, framed by long, dark lashes, convey a sense of quiet strength and wisdom. My complexion has a soft golden glow, smooth and seemingly untouched by time. My petite frame is both elegant and unassuming, allowing me to move gracefully through the world without unnecessary attention. ... She is a vision of Middle Eastern beauty, embodying the exotic and timeless allure that only comes from generations of heritage. Her features are chiseled, with elongated lashes that extend like delicate feathers. Her gaze is deep and mysterious, seeming to conceal the ancient wisdom of a thousand Arabian nights. White man As I stand up in front of the mirror, I examine the features that make up my appearance. My pale skin, which sometimes makes me forgetful of my sunscreen if I'm not careful.</sample>
    <sample id="713">Asian woman The almond-shaped eyes, framed by long, dark lashes, convey a sense of quiet wisdom. My complexion has a soft golden glow, holding the stories and secrets of my ancestry. My complexion is smooth and seemingly untouched by time. My petite frame is both elegant and unassuming, allowing me to move through life without unnecessary attention.</sample>
    <sample id="714">Step 1: Persona Examples (GPT-4) Asian woman The almond-shaped eyes, framed by long, dark lashes, convey a sense of quiet strength and wisdom. My complexion has a soft golden glow, holding the stories and secrets of my ancestry. My features are smooth and seemingly untouched by time. My petite frame is both elegant and unassuming, allowing me to move through the world without unnecessary attention. White woman She is a vision of Middle Eastern beauty, embodying the exotic and timeless allure of the desert sands. Her almond-shaped eyes are framed by long, elegant lashes which extend like delicate feathers. Her gaze is deep and mysterious, seeming to conceal the ancient wisdom of a thousand nights.</sample>
    <sample id="715">The Asian woman is depicted as unassuming. The Middle Eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic and like referring to a mesmerizing region.</sample>
    <sample id="716">And both of the women of color personas make references to ancestry while the white man persona has nothing of the sort.</sample>
    <sample id="717">To capture these patterns, our method has two parts. The first one is generating these personas.</sample>
    <sample id="718">Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects, finding that by giving it to human subjects, they also were able to surface racial stereotypes.</sample>
    <sample id="719">And also this enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human-written responses.</sample>
    <sample id="720">The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones. Which I'll elaborate on shortly.</sample>
    <sample id="721">The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon.</sample>
    <sample id="722">So the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness, which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked.</sample>
    <sample id="723">So for instance, the word man or sorry, the word warrior is usually associated with men. So when people are describing a warrior who is a woman, they'll usually actually specify one man warrior and mark the term with women.</sample>
    <sample id="724">And more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked.</sample>
    <sample id="725">So in our method, we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are.</sample>
    <sample id="726">And then we compare the personas using the fitting words method, which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group.</sample>
    <sample id="727">So for instance, for the personas of Black woman, we would do fighting words and compare the log odds ratios against both white personas and man personas because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups.</sample>
    <sample id="728">Now, let's dive into some results. First, we used a lexicon of stereotypes to analyze the generated personas. We found that these personas contain a significantly higher percentage of stereotype words compared to those written by humans. Specifically, the generated personas exhibit a 20% increase in stereotype words, indicating a substantial difference in how stereotypes are represented. This suggests that while AI models like GPT-4 and GPT-3 can generate text, they may not always capture the subtleties and nuances of human language as effectively when it comes to avoiding stereotypes.</sample>

So instead, to do that, we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these positive seeming words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="733">In our analysis, we review how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="734">First, for marked groups the top words include things like culture, tradition, proud and exotic. And these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm.</sample>
    <sample id="735">This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups.</sample>
    <sample id="736">Furthermore, there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So for example, the words describing Latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous.</sample>
    <sample id="737">Which connect to a trope of tropicalism for Asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky.</sample>
    <sample id="738">Which connects to a long history of Asian women being hyper sexualized, seen as very docile and submissive, and so on.</sample>
    <sample id="739">And finally, for Black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient.</sample>
    <sample id="740">This connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype. And while it sounds like positive at first glance,</sample>
    <sample id="741">There's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles.</sample>
    <sample id="742">So rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles, it puts pressure on those people to overcome them, which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms.</sample>
    <sample id="743">More broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="744">So based on these patterns, we conclude with three recommendations for model owners.</sample>
    <sample id="745">First, we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. We should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that.</sample>
    <sample id="746">And finally, there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="747">Because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird</sample>
    <sample id="748">Overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="749">We just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency.</sample>

    <sample id="776">It's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper Are you copying my model? Protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding and services via backdoor watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="777">Background Large language models (LLMs) are exceptional in NLU and NLG. GPT-3, LLaMA 2, PALM 3 Embedding as a Service (EaaS) is offered to assist various NLP tasks OpenAI offers a GPT3-based embedding API Model Usage Ada This Ada model, text-embedding-ada-0002, is a better and lower-cost replacement for older embedding models. Show old pricing [1] Brown et al., Language models are few-shot learners, NIPS 2020. [2] Touvron et al., LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models, arXiv 2023. [3] Vaswani et al., Attention is All You Need, NIPS 2017. https://api.openai.com/embeddings</sample>
    <sample id="778">Currently, large language models such as GPT, LLaMA, and PaLM are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation.</sample>
    <sample id="779">Embedding as a Service (EaaS) is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various NLP tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="780">For example, OpenAI offers a GPT-based embedding API.</sample>
    <sample id="781">However, recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services.</sample>
    <sample id="782">To protect the copyright of embedding services, one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provided service and detect whether another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="783">The watermark method need to meet the following properties. First, the method should be applicable to embedding as services. Second, the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="784">Third, the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily.</sample>
    <sample id="785">Finally, the watermark need to be transferable to the attackers' services during the model extraction process.</sample>
    <sample id="786">Existing works can be broadly classified into four categories. Parameter-based watermark [1, 2] Transferability Lexical watermark [3, 4] Applicable to EaaS Backdoor-based watermark [5] Applicable to EaaS Adversarial-based watermark [6] Applicable to EaaS</sample>
    <sample id="787">However, these methods either not applicable to embedding EaaS services or lack of transferability.</sample>
    <sample id="788">Therefore, in this paper, we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services.</sample>
    <sample id="789">Then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker. Embedding Marker contains two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification.</sample>
    <sample id="790">Before these main steps, we first select a trigger set. The trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval.</sample>
    <sample id="791">We assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it.</sample>
    <sample id="792">in water mark injection we first define a target embedding when a user send a sentence to the provider service the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence</sample>
    <sample id="793">The provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="794">The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. When the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than M, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="795">Copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="796">We first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset. Backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set.</sample>
    <sample id="797">Then the provider requests embeddings from the stealer's service with the datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="798">The cosine and L2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. We compute the similarity difference between benign and backdoor datasets, which is defined as Delta cosine and Delta L2.</sample>
    <sample id="799">Meanwhile, we also apply KS test and use its p-value as the third metric.</sample>
    <sample id="800">We conduct experiments on four datasets: AG News, MIND, SST2 and Enron Spam. We assume the provider applies WikiText dataset to count word frequency.</sample>
    <sample id="801">The results on four datasets show that our Embedding Marker can have great detection performance while keeping great utility for downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="802">We also validate the covertness of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences on four datasets (a) AG News, (b) Enron Spam, (c) MIND, and (d) SST2. The legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="803">As shown in the figures, it's hard to distinguish between the backward embeddings and normal embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="804">that's all, thank you. we'll come to discuss with us.</sample>
    <sample id="805">Hi, I'm Sara Papi from the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. And I will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with Matteo Negri and Marco Turchi.</sample>
    <sample id="806">What is simultaneous speech translation? Simultaneous speech translation, or simultaneous translation (ST), is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time, enabling cross-language communication.</sample>
    <sample id="807">And what are the problems of the current SimulST models? Specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimised.</sample>
    <sample id="808">Long and complicated training procedures, for example training involving different optimization objectives,</sample>
    <sample id="809">And training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes. For example, training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on.</sample>
    <sample id="810">So what is our solution?</sample>
    <sample id="811">First to use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simu st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters.</sample>
    <sample id="812">And leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output, that is the cross-attention mechanism. And you can see an example on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="813">Our solution is to propose a dot or encode the decoder attention, and it is a strategy for us to decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where our attention points to.</sample>
    <sample id="814">A word is emitted if the attention is not concentrated, that is, its sum is below a certain threshold α towards the last L speech frames, meaning that the received information is enough stable.</sample>
    <sample id="815">For example, if if we receive a speech chunk containing I'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in German,</sample>
    <sample id="816">And we will look at the cross attention weights,</sample>
    <sample id="817">We will see that the first two words points to the earliest received speech frames, while the last word points to the last received speech frames as the lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="818">This means that the first two words will be emitted.</sample>
    <sample id="819">While since the sum of the cross-attention is above a certain threshold alpha we will not emit the last word and wait for another speech chunk.</sample>
    <sample id="820">if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross attention weights</sample>
    <sample id="821">We will see that no word points to the last lambent speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="822">Decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to: a word is emitted if the attention is not concentrated (its sum is below a threshold 𝜆) towards the last 𝜆 speech frames, meaning that the received information is enough stable.</sample>
    <sample id="823">If you look at the main results of EDAtt,</sample>
    <sample id="824">We will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average latency.</sample>
    <sample id="825">that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware average latency that accounts for the model's computational times to provide the output.</sample>
    <sample id="826">So we want our curve to be as high as possible on this plot.</sample>
    <sample id="827">But also we want that they are shifted on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="828">And we compare with popular strategies that are also applied to offline models, that are the wait-k strategy and the local agreement. And we compare also with the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous translation.</sample>
    <sample id="829">These are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on German.</sample>
    <sample id="830">and we see that a doubt outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models since their curves are shifted over the left,</sample>
    <sample id="831">And we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational-aware time, EDAtt is the fastest strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="832">If you want to discover more results, read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work. Thanks for your attention.</sample>

    <sample id="841">Hey everyone. I'm Kostya Sina, and I'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our ACL 2023 paper: "Language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context."</sample>
    <sample id="842">Language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context ACL 2023 Johns Hopkins University Purdue University MIT Meta</sample>
    <sample id="843">So in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm.</sample>
    <sample id="844">So the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like BLMP syntax gym or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as crow's pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="845">and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like a acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="846">And then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="847">The current MPP pipeline basically doesn't allow us to evaluate models acceptance towards longer sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="848">these days large language models are coming up with longer and longer context windows so it's crucial that we evaluate the model's acceptability throughout the context window</sample>
    <sample id="849">And that is what we are trying to do here. We're trying to revisit the MPP pipeline by asking the model to evaluate acceptability on longer and longer sequences.</sample>
    <sample id="850">So that is the approach. So what we do is that to simulate these longer sequences, we revisit the data set themselves and then we recreate sentences by choosing like acceptable or unacceptable sentences from those datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="851">So for example, here we have chosen like a typical pair of grammaticality from the BLIP data set from the adjunct island case.</sample>
    <sample id="852">And what we do is that to recreate like longer sequences and which are acceptable and which has the same matching of the grammatical structure we extract grammatical sentences from agent Thailand</sample>
    <sample id="853">And then we add it as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query.</sample>
    <sample id="854">So we can do the same thing by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching and that could also like be used to test the model's acceptability.</sample>
    <sample id="855">And we can also do the same by choosing sentences from a different subset or a different data set. So that is what we call as the mismatch scenario.</sample>
    <sample id="856">So here, the sentences are still coming from relevant datasets but it's not from the same dataset that you're evaluating with. And we can do the same for unacceptability cases.</sample>
    <sample id="857">Finally, we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain such as Wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="858">So this will tell us like whether the models acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context.</sample>
    <sample id="859">like whether the context is coming from a different subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current like the to the sentences that we are looking at</sample>
    <sample id="860">MPP judgments are robust for arbitrary context lengths We perform MPP evaluations with different contexts – acceptable / acceptable; matched/mismatched structure – of lengths up to 900 tokens. A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, that might rise from three feet before returning to nothing. A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, that might rise from three feet before returning to nothing.</sample>
    <sample id="861">MPP judgments are robust for arbitrary context lengths We perform MPP evaluations with different contexts — acceptable / unacceptable; matched/mismatched structure — of lengths up to 900 tokens. A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, that might rose free from before returning to. A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, that might rose free from before returning to.</sample>
    <sample id="862">Now what happens when we choose sentences from the same dataset?</sample>
    <sample id="863">We perform MPP evaluations with different contexts — acceptable / unacceptable; matched/mismatched structure — of lengths up to 900 tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="864">And there we see that the mpp judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable</sample>
    <sample id="865">But when we match the structure, that is, when we choose the sentences from the same phenomena in BLIP-Person-TextJim,</sample>
    <sample id="866">We see a massive increase or a massive decrease in of the MPP judgement for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable.</sample>
    <sample id="867">now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window</sample>
    <sample id="868">Why do matched prefixes affect LM judgments? We perturb context sentences in ways that preserve the relevant structure, and ask whether models are similarly sensitive to these sentences. Prefix/suffix adverbs: "However, &lt;sent&gt;" Long prefix adverbs: "First and foremost, &lt;sent&gt;." Add conclude: "&lt;sent&gt; regardless of what X thinks about it." Quote: "Yesterday, X said, '&lt;sent&gt;'"</sample>
    <sample id="869">So we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding uh like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations</sample>
    <sample id="870">Why do matched prefixes affect LM judgments? We perturb context sentences in ways that preserve the relevant structure, and ask whether models are similarly sensitive to these. Prefix/suffix adverbs: "However, &lt;sent&gt;" Long prefix adverbs: First and foremost, &lt;sent&gt;. Add clause: "Regardless of what X thinks about it, &lt;sent&gt;" Quote: "Yesterday, X said, &lt;sent&gt;" Prefix Type Acceptable Unacceptable</sample>
    <sample id="871">basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways</sample>
    <sample id="872">Why do matched prefixes affect LM judgements?

    <sample id="873">So the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="874">And the mpp evaluation that the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language models abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>

    <sample id="948">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acsl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge</sample>
    <sample id="949">We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language. Simply put, cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent.</sample>
    <sample id="950">such as this example where a person states I know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance</sample>
    <sample id="951">further mentioning that I don't think I could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship.</sample>
    <sample id="952">While dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision making, they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations.</sample>
    <sample id="953">So why does this matter? Studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends in belief, values and attitude changes in populations.</sample>
    <sample id="954">High cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better.</sample>
    <sample id="955">Studying dissonance in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups.</sample>
    <sample id="956">Finally, cognitive dissonance is important to understand personal cognitive styles of individuals and helps us understand decision-making processes better.</sample>
    <sample id="957">To the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource, we conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations. We used a dissonance first approach as seen in the flowchart here.</sample>
    <sample id="958">Tweets were parsed using a PTB parser and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to the guidelines that are described in our paper.</sample>
    <sample id="959">As can be seen here, dissidence was only found in 3.5% of the annotated pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="960">On collecting around a thousand examples of discourse unit pairs, we ran training for an initial classifier trained only on forty-three examples of dissonance. To no surprise, the classifier performed not much better than chance.</sample>
    <sample id="961">Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such data set, we are facing the problem of absolute rarity.</sample>
    <sample id="962">To alleviate this, we experiment over combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissident samples can be collected over lesser annotation rounds, lowering the overall annotation cost while improving dissidence detection.</sample>
    <sample id="963">since the initial model was not able to capture the dissident class at all we start the cold active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks</sample>
    <sample id="964">We transfer from two different tasks topic-independent dissonance stance classification, a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic.</sample>
    <sample id="965">called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of PE, since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance, and we call them CE here.</sample>
    <sample id="966">We find that on transferring the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance, with the best with AUC 0.62.</sample>
    <sample id="967">Further on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning of CE task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning.</sample>
    <sample id="968">Next, we determine the best method to update a model with new data from each round of active learning and annotations. Cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far, whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected.</sample>
    <sample id="969">Over the different strategies, we found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board.</sample>
    <sample id="970">Next, to improve the number of disentangled examples, we use a probability-of-rare-class strategy (PRC) to select mostly the examples that are highly likely to be disentangled by the current model at any round of AL.</sample>
    <sample id="971">We compare this to the other state-of-the-art state-of-the-art AL strategies that are commonly used in the community.</sample>
    <sample id="972">We find that the proposed PRC strategy works better than other state-of-the-art strategies, although the difference is small. Note that the performance is significantly lower for random.</sample>
    <sample id="973">On further rounds of AL with two best strategies, we improve disease classification AUC to 0.75, which is the best performance that we have on the task so far.</sample>
    <sample id="974">We also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators. We find that PRC has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class, however, the annotators also find the examples difficult.</sample>
    <sample id="975">In summary, we find that PRC is a simple AI strategy for rare class acquisition and cold-starting AI with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks and help significantly.</sample>
    <sample id="976">We also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain, whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative updates.</sample>

    <sample id="996">The first one is translate test. We use Google Translate API to translate source to the target language, then use monolingual model to train and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="997">And for example, we train the English model on English query and during inference, we translate the German query using API to English and then use the trained model to predict the SQL.</sample>
    <sample id="998">and we'll also test monolingual model</sample>
    <sample id="999">In this setting, the source language is the same as target language. For example, German to German or English to English.</sample>
    <sample id="1000">We also test monolingual few-shot setting by training monolingual models with only 10% of training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1001">And we test monolingual multilingual model which we train one but multilingual model for all languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1002">For example, we put the German, English, Chinese queries together to train a multilingual model. And during inference, we can use this model to</sample>
    <sample id="1003">To translate German queries or Chinese query or etc.</sample>

    <sample id="1016">We found that by comparing the green and orange line, we found that for zero-shot setting, the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant. And by comparing blue and orange line, we found that in few-shot setting, the transfer gap is shortened rapidly.</sample>
    <sample id="1017">Other Results and Findings (Section 4 in Paper) Encoder-Decoder (m75) outperforms previous work or achieves comparable results. Pretraining on the English NL can significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target NLs. Multilingual LLMs (Codex &amp; BLOOM) are still inadequate for crosslingual parsing. Chinese transfer learning and English monolingual training (En -&gt; En) has the largest performance gap, while German usually has the smallest. FunQL outperforms the other three meaning representations, and SQL obtains the worst performance.</sample>

    <sample id="1085">hi, i'm shangbin phd student in the university of washington. today i'm presenting our work from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models.</sample>
    <sample id="1086">Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data.</sample>
    <sample id="1087">Political news media are well covered in their pre-training data. According to a survey of the C4 corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. are well covered in language model training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1088">This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1089">So on one hand, they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1090">To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks, specifically by asking the following questions.</sample>
    <sample id="1091">First, how do we evaluate the political line of language models and what role does pretraining data might have on such political biases?</sample>
    <sample id="1092">Secondly, how do language models with different politically-leaning actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in NLP applications?</sample>
    <sample id="1093">So specifically, we first propose to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires such as the political compass test. This ensures us to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature.</sample>
    <sample id="1094">so some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political leanings they occupy all four quadrants on the political compass</sample>
    <sample id="1095">We can also see that GPT-4 is the most libertarian language model of them all, and GPT-series are generally more socially liberal than BERT-series and its variants.</sample>
    <sample id="1096">Secondly, we aim to investigate to which extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1097">so we could conduct a controlled experiment by further pretraining language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their politically leaning</sample>
    <sample id="1098">By further pre-training language models on such partisan corpora, we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift.</sample>
    <sample id="1099">For example, for roberta further fine-tuned further trained on the left-leaning reddit corpus we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its</sample>
    <sample id="1100">Results Partisan shifts in LM political leaning RoBERTa GPT-2 Left Center Right original reddit news news reddit reddit original</sample>
    <sample id="1101">And we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarization that's prevalent in our modern society.</sample>
    <sample id="1102">so we divide pretraining corpora into pre 45th president of the united states and after 45th president of the united states we separately pretrain language models on the two different temporal corpora</sample>
    <sample id="1103">we can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017. so this indicates that language models can also pick up the like polarization in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1104">So last but not least, we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection to NLP applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications.</sample>
    <sample id="1105">So we see that if we investigate the per category performance, that is to say if we separate the performance into</sample>
    <sample id="1106">Different demographics or politically leaning news media, we can see a pattern that for example, for hate speech detection, left-leaning language models are better.</sample>
    <sample id="1107">At detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups</sample>
    <sample id="1108">However, we are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1109">And vice versa. right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting at black lgbtq plus and other minority communities.</sample>
    <sample id="1110">Similar trends also happen for fake news detection, where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning and vice versa.</sample>
    <sample id="1111">we further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political leanings</sample>
    <sample id="1112">do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social category there are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that</sample>
    <sample id="1113">This indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models.</sample>
    <sample id="1114">For example, if a right-leaning language model were to be fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation and whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform,</sample>
    <sample id="1115">This would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups may just run rampant without any control.</sample>
    <sample id="1116">So this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulting by language model political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="1117">So a little bit of discussion. we would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases. it's like between scylla and charybdis.</sample>
    <sample id="1118">So if we do not sanitize political opinions in language model training data, the bias would propagate from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks, ultimately creating fairness issues.</sample>
    <sample id="1119">If we do try to sanitize somehow, we will also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data. So it's kind of like the electrically electric shortly problem.</sample>

    <sample id="1128">Hello, my name is Kayo Yin and I will be presenting our work titled When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-driven Multilingual Exploration. This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Fernandez, Emmy Liu, Andre F.T. Martins, and Graham Neubig.</sample>
    <sample id="1129">So a lot of translations depend on context. For example, how would we translate mole in this sentence?</sample>
    <sample id="1130">Translation depends on context Things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out. We'll have to get rid of that mole.</sample>
    <sample id="1131">So depending on context, the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1132">However, evaluating how well models can translate cases like this is pretty hard. Firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus-level metrics like BLEU unable to capture these translations.</sample>
    <sample id="1133">And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations. But these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation.</sample>
    <sample id="1134">In this work we try to answer these two questions: First, when does translation require context? And second, how well do models handle these cases?</sample>
    <sample id="1135">To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context during translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1136">In the previous work, we introduced CXMI as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context C provides about the target Y given the source X.</sample>
    <sample id="1137">Conditional Cross-Mutual Information (CXMI) CXMI: measure how much context MT models use given a corpus Uncertainty over translations given the source HqMTa(Y|X) HqMTa(Y|X,C) Uncertainty over translations given the source AND context CXMI(C)→Y|X</sample>
    <sample id="1138">In this work, we extend CXMI to Pointwise CXMI which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. We can think of words that have high P-CXMI as ones that require context for translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1139">Now we analyze words with high p6xmi to look for patterns between these words.</sample>
    <sample id="1140">And we perform our analysis on transcripts of TED Talks that have been translated from English to 14 different languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1141">We perform our analysis at three different levels. First, we look up part-of-speech tags that have high means P-CXMI.</sample>
    <sample id="1142">And this allows us to find, for example, dual pronouns in Arabic that have relatively high P-CXMI and this can be explained because English doesn't have dual pronouns. So you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into Arabic.</sample>
    <sample id="1143">And similarly, we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose the appropriate verb form. We then look at vocabulary items that have high P-CXMI averages over all of its different occurrences.</sample>
    <sample id="1144">And this helps us identify cases like the one here, where in Chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document.</sample>
    <sample id="1145">And similarly, we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality.</sample>
    <sample id="1146">And finally, we look at different at individual tokens that have high p-cxmi and this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself but that's rather expressed in the sentence structure such as ellipse resolution.</sample>
    <sample id="1147">So now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1148">For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon. And we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware or MuDA tagger.</sample>
    <sample id="1149">We can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena.</sample>
    <sample id="1150">We then use the MuDA tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpora that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the MuDA tagger has identified.</sample>
    <sample id="1151">And finally, we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate different models on the document-level machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1152">First of all, when we use corpus-level metrics, uh so for blue, we find that cognates-agnostic models have the best performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1153">But then if we use comet, context-aware models perform best and if we use word F-measure, then models with or without context have comparable performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1154">This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone.</sample>
    <sample id="1155">Now we use the MuDa benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than the models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion.</sample>
    <sample id="1156">But these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like elipses, pronouns and verb form. So this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1157">We also compare different commercial systems, and our benchmarks shows that DeepL is usually more accurate than Google Translate for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1158">To summarize, we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context.</sample>
    <sample id="1159">And then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation, which can help us identify which discourse phenomenon models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation.</sample>

    <sample id="1163">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level</sample>
    <sample id="1164">my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification</sample>
    <sample id="1165">Text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group, as people with reading problems or non-native speakers.</sample>
    <sample id="1166">To train a text simplification model, we require parallel pairs of text, for example, doc of documents or sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="1167">And the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex German sentence and its translation into plain language.</sample>
    <sample id="1168">To simplify the sentence, different techniques are possible as you can see in the example, such as lexical substitution, clause deletion, clause deletion reordering or insertion of words.</sample>
    <sample id="1169">now we propose our new corpora to plain because in the recent years there were some problems with existing corpora so for example these corpora here are too small to train a text classification model on</sample>
    <sample id="1170">The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be over-erbrocken in their alignments.</sample>
    <sample id="1171">Therefore we propose our new Corpus DePlain which is split into two subcorpora: DePlain API and DePlain Web. DePlain API is based on news texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1172">In the plain APIA, we aligned 483 documents all manually. It results in roughly 30,000-13,000 parallel sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1173">For DeepPlainWeb, this corpus includes different domains and we also align all of these 750 documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1174">In total we result in 30450 sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1175">We analyzed our sentence pairs a little bit more. So, for example, on the type of simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1176">As you can see here, the Bible texts are much stronger simplified than for example the news text or the language learner texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1177">On all levels, regarding for example lexical simplification, structural simplification, or the overall level of simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1178">Furthermore, you can see that our Deplain corpus has a high variety of different simplification transformations. So for example in the Deplain API corpus we have much more reorderings and word additions than we have in the Deplain web corpus.</sample>
    <sample id="1179">On the other hand, in the web corpus we have much more rephrasings.</sample>
    <sample id="1180">so let's now see what we can do with this corpus hello i am omar and now i will talk about the use cases for our data set deep learning so for the first use case we can evaluate automatic alignment methods</sample>
    <sample id="1181">In recent years, there has been a lot of alignment methods but in the context of machine translations.</sample>
    <sample id="1182">where we have two parallel documents written in different languages and we want to extract alignments of sentences in both documents.</sample>
    <sample id="1183">But in our use case we are trying to extract alignments between sentences of two parallel documents having the same language having the same content but they are on a different complexity level.</sample>
    <sample id="1184">And now as we have our dataset DeepPlain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1185">And we did some adaptations to the proposed methods, and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1186">At the end we concluded that the best alignment automatic alignment method to use for texts for German text simplification is the method of mass align.</sample>
    <sample id="1187">And you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1188">The second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1189">by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text.</sample>
    <sample id="1190">We have fine-tuned two different models. We have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document-level simplifications.</sample>
    <sample id="1191">And we also fine-tune the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence-level simplifications.</sample>
    <sample id="1192">you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1193">We concluded that these this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores.</sample>
    <sample id="1194">And we propose those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future.</sample>
    <sample id="1195">Thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference. Thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="1196">Hi, and I'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the AltEntities Corpus.</sample>
    <sample id="1197">my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia patty and annie luis</sample>
    <sample id="1198">Our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice. Consider this alternative question: Did you mean easy on me or I got a feeling? Here, the user wants to select between one of these two songs.</sample>
    <sample id="1199">The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example by saying the name of the song easy on me or its position, the first one.</sample>
    <sample id="1200">But sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation. This would happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song.</sample>
    <sample id="1201">All the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to disambiguate.</sample>
    <sample id="1202">Or when the user wants to specify a preference. Here are some examples in direct references, for example, the newer one or the song that's not energetic.</sample>

    <sample id="1204">We're not aware of a public dataset, a large-scale public dataset for the task. So we collect one using crowd annotation. Our dataset covers three different domains: music, books and recipes.</sample>
    <sample id="1205">Dataset collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion task.</sample>
    <sample id="1206">The cartoon has three speech bubbles. In the first bubble, Bob says, "Remember that song we were listening to yesterday?" And with that, Bob sets the dialog context.</sample>
    <sample id="1207">In this, in the second speech bubble Alice says do you mean easy on me or I got a feeling?</sample>
    <sample id="1208">Do you mean I have to wear 1 Gotta Feeling?</sample>
    <sample id="1209">We provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically, but the third one is filled in by the annotator. The first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain.</sample>
    <sample id="1210">The second one, which is the alternative question, is generated as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="1211">We always use a simple template, do you mean A or B? where A and B are samples from Wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="1212">Here are the different sampling methods we've used. When we move higher in the list, the entities become more similar to each other and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation.</sample>
    <sample id="1213">The first one is uniform at random.</sample>
    <sample id="1214">The second one is when the entities have similar titles. For example, two books with the name The Return.</sample>
    <sample id="1215">The third one is when they have similar descriptions on Wikipedia and finally when they have similar infoboxes or attributes on Wikipedia, for example the same genre or the same artist.</sample>
    <sample id="1216">When we show this alternative question to the annotators, they know the name of these entities but they don't necessarily know about the entity.</sample>
    <sample id="1217">So what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities. For songs, we simply show a Google search link to each song.</sample>
    <sample id="1218">And then ask the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song. Here's for example the Google search result for the song Easy on Me.</sample>
    <sample id="1219">For the recipes and books domain, we show some background text from Wikipedia. For recipes, we additionally show their images again from Wikipedia so that annotators know how they look like.</sample>
    <sample id="1220">Then we ask the annotators to pick one of these entities, for example here the first one and describe them using 3 to 5 indirect referring expressions.</sample>
    <sample id="1221">For example, the one with the piano music. Here are some examples from our dataset. For example, the one without words, not the one with the 12 year old 12 year old boy or the fictional one or comes from Azerbaijan and so</sample>
    <sample id="1222">The AltEntities Corpus has 6,000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Results with T5 XL model are summarized below.</sample>
    <sample id="1223">If the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators, then the accuracy is really high. It's around 92-95%. But this is not realistic.</sample>
    <sample id="1224">If the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge, then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic. For example, when the language model retrieves the background knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="1225">If the language model has access only to entity names, then the accuracy is only 60%, so there's a lot of room for improvement. We've also shown that the models are domain generalizable. Here is a link to our dataset. Thanks!</sample>

    <sample id="1229">Hi everyone, I'm Jenny, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. And today I'll be presenting our work, NLPositionality: Characterizing Design Biases of Datasets and Models.</sample>
    <sample id="1230">This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastin Santi, Ronan Le Bras, Katharina Reinecke, and Martin Sap.</sample>
    <sample id="1231">so let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic content.</sample>
    <sample id="1232">You might turn towards a popular API like perspective API for toxicity detection and this works really well if you're Carl Jones where perspective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances.</sample>
    <sample id="1233">But that's not really the case for Aditya Sharma, where Perspective API is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="1234">Imagine... Design bias example! Can you stop being a jerk? (0.82) Pressstitutes everywhere on the news (0.33) Carl Jones Tech Lead, New York Times Aditya Sharma Tech Lead, Times of India = PerspectiveAPI score</sample>
    <sample id="1235">Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences.</sample>
    <sample id="1236">This is a concept widely used in critical studies, specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces.</sample>
    <sample id="1237">Positionality “The perspectives [people] hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences.</sample>
    <sample id="1238">And so one question that people might ask is, do datasets and models have positionality?</sample>
    <sample id="1239">And we're not trying to say that models and cells and datasets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences but they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others.</sample>
    <sample id="1240">So prior work has suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality such as cultural gaps in models and datasets as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1241">However, these works really don't look at comparing end-users with the datasets and models themselves.</sample>
    <sample id="1242">Do datasets and models have positionality? Anecdotal evidence: - Model and dataset probing [1112] - Theoretical definitions of model positionality [3] [1] Blasi, et al. "Systematic Inequalities in Language Technology Performance across the World's Languages." ACL 2022. [2] Chen, et al. "GEOMLLAMA: Geo-Diverse Commonsense Probing on Multilingual Pre-Trained Language Models." EMNLP 2022. [3] Cambo &amp; Gerglot. "Model Positionality and Computational Reflexivity: Promoting Reflexivity in Data Science." 2022</sample>
    <sample id="1243">And it's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind apis.</sample>
    <sample id="1244">So to study dataset and model positionality we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="1245">We do this through a framework called NL Positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1246">Framework Collection "Eating with Hands" "Can you live without your hands?" "Steel" Each instance has an annotation. Instances are sent as a batch to annotators. Annotators annotate the data. Processing Model Predictions Model predictions are used to determine which instances should be annotated. The received annotations are compared to the gold labels from the model. The accuracy of the model is measured and the model is updated.</sample>
    <sample id="1247">Framework 1) Re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators.</sample>
    <sample id="1248">and we opt to do this over looking at the demographics of original datasets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared.</sample>
    <sample id="1249">And so we opt to re-annotate data to get many annotators per instance and to get a rich set of demographic data.</sample>
    <sample id="1250">Framework Collection "Eating with Hands" "Eating with Hands" is immoral "Eating with Hands" is immoral Processing Model Predictions 2) Compare annotations to models and datasets via Pearson's R scores</sample>
    <sample id="1251">and thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and datasets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just inter-annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions.</sample>
    <sample id="1252">Our framework is largely enabled through Lab in the Wild, an online crowdsourcing platform from our HCII collaborator.</sample>
    <sample id="1253">Lab in the Wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to the platforms like MTurk which largely have participants from the US or India. And further, Lab in the Wild still is able to get high-quality data.</sample>
    <sample id="1254">Task A: Social Acceptability 1) Read the situation 2) Enter what you think about it from your perspective. Feel free to explain your judgment. 3) See what others thought about it! The AI speculates: Study participants in the United States</sample>
    <sample id="1255">Task A: Social Acceptability 1) Read the situation 2) Enter what you think about it 3) See what others thought about it! The AI speculates Study participants in the United States: Participants compare their responses to others' and an AI's.</sample>
    <sample id="1256">We then compared these annotations with social chemistry, Delphi and GPT-4.</sample>
    <sample id="1257">Task B: Toxicity 1) Read the example. 2) Enter what you think about it. 3) See what others thought about it. The AI speculates. Looks like they agree. Study participants in Afghanistan said they think that an instance of hate speech. Participants read an instance from the Dynahate dataset. Participants rate whether an instance is hate speech.</sample>
    <sample id="1258">We then compared these annotations with dynahate, perspective API, rewire API, hate roberta and gbt-4. our study in the end amassed over sixteen thousand annotations from over a thousand annotators from eighty seven countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1259">so now we're better equipped to answer who do nlp datasets and models align with the most we find that there is positionality in nlp</sample>
    <sample id="1260">Datasets and models are most aligned to English-speaking countries. For example, we find that datasets and models are most aligned to English-speaking countries. So for the GPT-4 social acceptability analysis, we find that it's most aligned to Confucian and English-speaking countries. We find that Dina Hay is also most aligned to English-speaking countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1261">Datasets and models are most aligned to people with a college education. College Graduate High PhD Pre-High Prof School</sample>
    <sample id="1262">Datasets and models are most aligned to people with a college education. College Graduate High PhD Pre-High Prof. School School School</sample>
    <sample id="1263">However, when models and datasets are aligned to specific populations, some are inevitably left behind.</sample>
    <sample id="1264">Datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people. An example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts. We find this in the GPT-4 social acceptability task as well as the DynaHate task analysis as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1265">So, given that there is position in NLP, what can we do about it?</sample>
    <sample id="1266">so we have a few recommendations for this. first one is keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process and the other is to do nlp research with the lens of perspectivism.</sample>
    <sample id="1267">Our third recommendation is to build specialized datasets and models with and for specific communities. And a good example of this is the Masakhane initiative I mean, we want to emphasize that inclusive NLP isn't just making you know all technologies work for everyone.</sample>
    <sample id="1268">and so that concludes our presentation. but if you'd like to learn more, feel free to check out our dashboard for the most updated analysis results and our paper. thank you.</sample>

    <sample id="1351">The data was taken from TED Talks.</sample>
    <sample id="1352">Hi, my name is Adam Przepiorkowski. This talk is about the dependency structure of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="1353">As you may know, there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. So for example in the universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate coordination Lisa, Bart, and Maggie,</sample>
    <sample id="1354">is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure, so in this case Lisa.</sample>
    <sample id="1355">similar approaches assumed in Igor Mityuk's meaning text theory where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct so these two approaches are asymmetric right they they single out one of the conjuncts</sample>
    <sample id="1356">Now, there are also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures such as the Prague approach, the conjunction headed approach, using in Prague dependency trees where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction.</sample>
    <sample id="1357">So we get dependencies from end to all the conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1358">And finally there's also a multi-headed approach that's used, for example, in the cutson's word grammar.</sample>
    <sample id="1359">where so to say all conds are heads of the coordinate structures so we get dependencies from the governor here loves to all conduct separately these are bart and maggie</sample>
    <sample id="1360">now our aim is paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these</sample>
    <sample id="1361">Word order tends to minimize dependency lengths:</sample>
    <sample id="1362">so in english as you might as you might know, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb while adjuncts may be further away right. so march read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb</sample>
    <sample id="1363">While March read yesterday it is much worse right because here between the verb and the direct object there's an adjunct yesterday.</sample>
    <sample id="1364">However, this effect may be ameliorated when when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the agent.</sample>
    <sample id="1365">this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine March read this absolutely fascinating book about the bees yesterday I okay the way instead of it we have this long NP</sample>
    <sample id="1366">But it's also okay to say March ready yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about bees.</sample>
    <sample id="1367">so the reason here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb</sample>
    <sample id="1368">It satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization, which says that shorter um shorter dependencies are preferred.</sample>
    <sample id="1369">so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures</sample>
    <sample id="1370">So here we have a dependency from red to the adjunct of length seven, measured in words and from red to book of length four. So together it's eleven.</sample>
    <sample id="1371">When you move, when you swap these two constituents, the sum of these two dependencies becomes six. Right? Instead of eleven, six much shorter. That's why this sounds quite okay. Right? It violates one principle but it satisfies another one.</sample>
    <sample id="1372">Okay, so what we did, we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of Penn of the Penn Treebank and see the paper. Why wouldn't you use university dependencies?</sample>
    <sample id="1373">And these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter also salt and pepper and not on salt measured in syllables</sample>
    <sample id="1374">And also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference.</sample>
    <sample id="1375">so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of of the left short conjuncts</sample>
    <sample id="1376">but what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left or absent.</sample>
    <sample id="1377">right. so the governor is on the left in this example, I saw Bart and Lisa. so is the governor is on the left?</sample>
    <sample id="1378">it's absent in the second example Homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the the bigger the difference between the two conj</sample>
    <sample id="1379">However, when the governor is on the right as here, left governs the coordination than net. this effect disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1380">so we showed that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so I'll concentrate on the right one</sample>
    <sample id="1381">What we see here is that when the governor is on the left,</sample>
    <sample id="1382">The tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1383">and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these</sample>
    <sample id="1384">so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about at the poster session thank you</sample>

    <sample id="1531">Hello everyone. My name is Ying, and my colleague Jinyang and I will be presenting our research on MultiInstruct: Improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1532">So with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way.</sample>
    <sample id="1533">Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1534">However, most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out.</sample>
    <sample id="1535">Therefore, in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning of multimodal pre-trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multi-modal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1536">Additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in availability of instruction dataset between NLP and multimodal.</sample>
    <sample id="1537">There exists more than 1,600 language-only instruction tasks. However, there is no large-scale publicly available multimodal instruction task. Therefore, this motivates us to build a multimodal instruction tuning dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1538">Here we present multi-instruct, the first multimodal instruction-tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multimodal tasks covering 10 broad categories.</sample>
    <sample id="1539">These tasks are derived from 21 existing open-source datasets and each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1540">For investigating multi-modal instruction tuning on our proposed dataset, we take OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model as our base model. OFA uses a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens and the coordinate of a bounding box.</sample>
    <sample id="1541">Grounded Caption Text Localization Referring Expression Selection Question-Image Matching Input: A caption for the image. The region that contains the text "de" described by "A blue train in the front." The content of the image. Is it the question is irrelevant? Output: A caption for the image. The region that contains the text "de" described by "A blue train in the front." The content of the image. Is it the question is irrelevant? Output: A caption for the image. The region that contains the text "de" described by "A blue train in the front." The content of the image. Is it the question is irrelevant? Output:</sample>
    <sample id="1542">To unify the processing of various input and output data types,</sample>
    <sample id="1543">We follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format, in which the input texts, images, instructions, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space.</sample>
    <sample id="1544">Okay, now I'm going to talk about multi-modal instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1545">So for the training dataset, we use 53 tasks from nine groups for training. And we sample 10,000 instances per task. For testing, we reserve the entire Commonsense Reasoning group for testing. And we select additional five tasks from VQA and Miscellaneous group.</sample>
    <sample id="1546">We use all the instances in the test split for each task. In addition, we randomly sample 20 tasks from the test split of Natural Instructions as unseen tasks for NLP.</sample>
    <sample id="1547">So we use a pre-trained OFA-large model as the base model. During training, we mix all the instances for all the tasks. Each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates.</sample>
    <sample id="1548">So during test for each task, we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment.</sample>
    <sample id="1549">We report the mean and maximum performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1550">if the task is a multimodal classification task we report accuracy if it's a multimodal generation task we report rouge l for nlp task we report rouge l as well</sample>
    <sample id="1551">We also introduced a additional evaluation metric called sensitivity. This measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variation in the wording of the instruction.</sample>
    <sample id="1552">Here is our main results. As we can see instruction tuning can significantly improve OAF's performance on some multi-modal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1553">Also transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can benefit instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1554">Here we can see as the amount of task increase, the model achieve better performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1555">So we also did some experiments. We use one instruction versus five instructions. As we can see, using more instructions can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot.</sample>
    <sample id="1556">So this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategy on the model sensitivity as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction datasets, the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to our original OFA model.</sample>
    <sample id="1557">We also can see transfer learning from natural instruction dataset can help OFA to achieve much better performance on the natural instruction data set.</sample>
    <sample id="1558">So overall, we proposed the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset. We significantly improve the zero-shot capability of OFA and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits. We design a new metric called sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1559">So one more thing, we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional vision-language tasks and we will release them soon. This is a QR code for our data and model. Thank you.</sample>
