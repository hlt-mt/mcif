    <sample id="2">The paper presents a novel pre-trained model, LayoutMask, for Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) tasks. It addresses the reading order issues in existing models by using local 1D positions instead of global 1D positions. LayoutMask incorporates two novel masking strategies: Whole Word Masking and Layout-Aware Masking, which promote text-layout interactions and cross-segment orders. Additionally, it introduces a new pre-training objective, Masked Position Modeling (MPM), which enhances text-layout interactions through symmetric pre-training. The experiments demonstrate that LayoutMask outperforms existing models on various VrDU tasks, particularly when using local 1D positions. The paper provides further details on the proposed model and its performance in the supplementary materials.</sample>

    <sample id="6">Jiaan presented a work titled "Towards Unifying Multi-Lingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization" in collaboration with Fandong, Duo, Yunlong, Zhixu, Jianfeng, and Jie. The work introduces many-to-many summarization, a more general setting that aims to build one summarization model capable of processing documents in any source language and generating summaries in any target language. The team conducted preliminary studies comparing multilingual, cross-lingual, and many-to-many summarization, finding that the latter can better transfer task knowledge across different languages. They proposed PISCES, a pre-trained many-to-many summarization model that learns language modeling, cross-lingual ability, and summarization ability through three-stage pre-training. The team trained four models using the WikiLingua dataset, including mBART ONE, mBART U-CLS, mBART MLS, and mBART Many-to-Many Summarization. Experimental results showed that the multilingual model trained in the many-to-many summarization setting outperformed other models. PISCES also outperformed various baselines, including mBART-50 and mT5, as shown in ablation studies and human studies.</sample>
    <sample id="7">Yes, according to the paper presented by Shuheng, CoNLL-2003 taggers still work well in 2023. The paper investigated the generalization of models developed for the NER task using CoNLL-2003 and found that they can still perform well on modern data. The main ingredients needed for good generalization are a better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine-tuning examples. The performance drop observed was caused by temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting.</sample>

    <sample id="10">To improve the score in resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection, several advances can be made:

1. Enhancing the language model's understanding of context: By training the language model on a larger and more diverse dataset that includes various conversational contexts, it can better understand the nuances of human language and improve its ability to disambiguate indirect references.

2. Improving the language model's access to background knowledge: Providing the language model with more comprehensive and accurate background information about entities can help it make more informed decisions when resolving indirect references.

3. Developing more sophisticated disambiguation techniques: Researchers can explore new methods for disambiguating indirect references, such as incorporating external knowledge sources or using machine learning algorithms to analyze the conversation history and identify patterns in how users refer to entities.

4. Enhancing the language model's ability to recognize pronouns and coreference: By improving the language model's understanding of pronouns and coreference, it can better track the entities being referred to throughout the conversation, leading to more accurate disambiguation.

5. Incorporating user feedback and preferences: Collecting user feedback on the accuracy of the language model's disambiguation can help refine the model over time, as well as allow it to learn from user preferences and adapt to their communication style.

6. Expanding the AltEntities Corpus: Increasing the size and diversity of the AltEntities Corpus by collecting more data through crowd annotation can provide the language model with more examples to learn from and improve its performance in resolving indirect referring expressions.

By pursuing these advances, researchers can develop more accurate and effective language models that can better understand and resolve indirect referring expressions in conversations.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem's work, "Finding the SWEET Spot: Analysis and Improvement of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings," focuses on reducing inference time for large language models by utilizing adaptive inference methods. Two common methods are Multi Model and Early Exit. Multi Model involves storing multiple models trained separately, while Early Exit uses multiple classifiers following intermediate transformer layers. Rotem hypothesizes that Early Exit suffers from conflicting gradients due to shared model parameters among classifiers. He tests this hypothesis by comparing Early Exit models with separate Multi Model classifiers, showing that Multi Model classifiers outperform Early Exit by an average of 2.3%. Rotem introduces SWEET (Separating Weights in Early Exit Transformers), a novel fine-tuning method that avoids conflicting gradients by training each layer only with updates from its following classifier. SWEET closes the gap between Early Exit and Multi Model but negatively affects later classifiers in some cases. Overall, Rotem's work highlights the existence of conflicting gradients in Early Exit training and introduces SWEET as a promising approach for improving Early Exit architectures.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student at NUS, introduced their work on multimodal relation extraction. This task aims to determine the semantic relation between entities in text data, but often lacks context in realistic scenarios like social media. To address this, they propose a framework that incorporates visual sources and multimodal topic information. The framework consists of five parts: representing text and images with scene graphs, merging them into a cross-modal graph (CMG), screening initial CMG structures, enriching compressed CMG features with multimodal topic features, and integrating multimodal topic words through attention operations. Experiments on the MRE dataset show that leveraging visual features and multimodal topic information improve performance over text-based methods. Ablation studies reveal that internal-information screening is crucial for high-cross-modal-relevance inputs, while external-information exploiting is more useful for low-cross-modal-relevance inputs. Overall, their system achieves significant improvements over existing models.</sample>

They focus on the two-stage model proposed by Danqi Chen in 2017, which uses retrieval and reader frameworks. The main challenges are the large Wikipedia corpus (26 million documents, 20 GB), the 65 GB index file for searching, and the use of multiple language models with millions of parameters. To achieve efficient systems, they propose techniques such as approximate nearest neighbor search, skip reading, document filtering, embedding compression, lightweight models, parameter sharing, and knowledge distillation. They compare existing models and conclude that retrieval-only systems are good for real-time feedback, while retrieval and reader systems are better for trade-offs. Future works include deploying open-domain question answering systems on low-power devices and considering more evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Dan Garrette and his team have been working on improving the ability of text-image models to render visual text. They focused on the Imagen model, which uses a T5-XXL encoder to encode input text and then generates an image using a diffusion model. While the model can produce high-quality images, it often struggles with representing text.

The team conducted experiments to understand the text encoders' performance in spelling words. They found that smaller T5 models have low accuracy in spelling, even for simple words. Larger models like PaLM improve the accuracy but are impractical due to their size. ByT5, which receives individual bytes of input, performs well in spelling across all scales.

To improve text rendering, the team augmented the Imagen model by concatenating an additional text representation from the ByT5-small model. This improved the model's ability to spell and rendered text better, although errors can still occur during generation. The main takeaways from their paper include the WikiSpell benchmark for text-only models, the DrawText benchmark for text-to-image models, and a new efficient strategy for improving model spelling ability by concatenating character-aware models.</sample>
    <sample id="24">The tendency for left conjuncts to be shorter was measured by extracting various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the Penn Treebank, as well as observing the length difference between the two conjuncts.

    <sample id="25">The experiments were designed to study the effect of the governor's position by measuring the length of the conjuncts in characters, syllables, and words. The researchers extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the Penn Treebank and observed that the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily when the governor is on the left or absent. However, when the governor is on the right, this effect disappears, providing an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination and for symmetric structures.</sample>

The framework is based on pairwise ranking and generative fusion, aiming to select the optimal model for each input example rather than relying on a single top-performing model. The authors propose a two-stage process: first, they run multiple models to obtain their outputs; second, they use a PairRanker module to compare these outputs with the input using cross-attention mechanisms. The top K candidates are then selected and fused by a sequence-to-sequence model to generate the final output. The framework is evaluated using a new dataset called MixInstruct, which includes instruction datasets from 11 open-source large language models. Experimental results show that LLM-Blender outperforms individual models in most cases, demonstrating its effectiveness as a simple yet powerful ensemble learning framework.</sample>

    <sample id="34">Marcos Treviso presented a work called "CREST: A Joint Framework for Rationalization and Counterfactual Text Generation" in collaboration with Alexis Ross, Nuno Guerreiro, and André Martins. The work proposes a joint framework that combines selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation to leverage their complementary strengths. CREST generates counterfactuals by masking the original input alongside prepending the gold label to it, and then passing the masked inputs to an editor which fills in the masked response with new tokens. The quality of the counterfactuals produced by CREST is evaluated using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The results show that CREST counterfactuals are more valid and natural than those produced by MiCE and other automatic approaches. CREST can also be used for data augmentation and rationalization with both factual and counterfactual examples. Experiments on IMDB and SNLI datasets show that CREST-Rationalization achieves the top result on IMDB itself, performs on par with data augmentation using human counterfactuals on contrastive datasets, and outperforms other methods on out-of-domain datasets. Overall, CREST produces plausible explanations that focus on the contrasting parts of the input.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The paper "Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation" by Telmo Pessoa Pires and colleagues proposes a method to increase the capacity per language in multilingual machine translation while keeping inference costs constant. The authors introduce Language-Specific Layers (LSLs), which consist of one regular transformer layer per language, used to select and train at inference time the correct sublayer. This approach allows for limited capacity per language but increases it only where it matters the most.

The authors explore LSL placement and find that placing LSLs in the encoder yields better results than in the decoder. They use a model with shared, source, and target weights to learn the best placement of LSLs. The results show that their approach outperforms both language adapters and the largest baseline model, especially for low-resource languages. The paper also includes ablation studies, different metrics, and setups for shared or separate decoders.</sample>

    <sample id="41">The research presented in this paper, titled "PeaCoK: Persona Commonsense Knowledge for Consistent and Engaging Narratives," is a collaboration between the Natural Language Processing Lab at EPFL University and Sony Group Corporation. The study aims to address the challenge of sustaining coherent and engaging narratives by understanding how personas ground narrative. The researchers propose a Persona-grounded Commonsense Knowledge Graph (PeaCoK) that represents real-world personas and their interconnections.

PeaCoK contains about 3,800 personas with 40,000 distinctive attributes, forming around 100,000 personal inferences or facts. The graph is built in three steps: selecting personas from existing commonsense graphs, inducing attributes from knowledge graphs and pre-trained language models, and crowdsourcing annotations using a joint human-AI majority voting scheme.

The study evaluates PeaCoK's effectiveness by training a BART-based common knowledge generator on a persona attribute inference task and comparing it to large-scale pre-trained language models. The results indicate that PeaCoK can help language models learn and generalize persona knowledge.

Additionally, the research explores the use of PeaCoK knowledge to improve downstream narrative modeling in a persona-grounded dialogue generation task. The results show that PeaCoK augmented models achieve better dialogue generation on various aspects compared to the baseline model. The study also highlights the importance of learning interconnected world persona knowledge in narratives.</sample>

    <sample id="54">Vasudha, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, presented her work on cognitive dissonance detection at ACL 2023. She defined cognitive dissonance as the inconsistency between beliefs or actions and emphasized its importance in understanding decision-making processes, mental health, and polarization. To address the rarity of dissonance in language, they developed a cognitive dissonance resource by annotating 1,000 discourse unit pairs using a dissonance-first approach. They faced challenges due to the low occurrence of dissonance and used transfer learning and active learning to improve detection. They transferred weights from closely related tasks like debate stance classification and CE tasks, achieving better zero-shot performance. They found that the cumulative update strategy performed better than iterative for domain active annotations. The proposed Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy outperformed other AL strategies in rare class acquisition. Overall, their work highlights the potential of transfer learning and active learning in addressing the rare-class challenge in cognitive dissonance detection.</sample>

It discusses two primary categories: visual contexts, such as geometric diagrams, and tabular contexts. The paper highlights the importance of automated theorem proving and the challenges faced by language models in performing precise mathematical reasoning. To address these limitations, the paper proposes using pre-trained language models, such as LLMs, and augmenting them with tools like program-aided LMMs. Despite progress in creating non-English datasets and benchmarks for various domains, the paper notes that learning models still struggle with generalization and robustness on reasoning tasks, particularly with large numbers.</sample>
    <sample id="67">Uri discusses interference in multilingual translation models, which can either improve or negatively affect translation quality between language pairs. He identifies key factors contributing to interference, such as model size, data size, language similarity, and the number of languages involved. The study finds that severe interference occurs in small models with limited data, while tuning the sampling temperature is crucial for strong performance. The research also suggests that language similarity and the number of languages have less impact on interference levels. By using a baseline for battling interference based on weak size in small models and weak uncalibrated temperature in larger models, the problem can be significantly reduced without specialized methods.</sample>

    <sample id="71">The audio discusses the work on "Resolving Indirect Referring Expressions for Entity Selection" by Javad Hosseini and a team of researchers. They introduce the AltEntities Corpus, which aims to understand users' language when making choices. The study focuses on indirect references in conversational systems and benchmarking LLMs' entity understanding. The researchers created a larger-scale public data set using crowd annotation, covering music, books, and recipes. They used a cartoon completion setup with three speech bubbles: Bob sets the context, Alice asks an alternative question, and Bob uses an indirect reference to select one of the entities. Annotators were provided background knowledge about the entities and asked to describe them using indirect referring expressions. The AltEntities Corpus contains 6,000 alternative questions across three domains and 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Results show high accuracy when the language model has access to the same background knowledge as annotators, but lower accuracy when only partially overlapping or only entity names are available. The models demonstrated domain generalizability.</sample>

The existing methods often rely on simple keyword-based approaches or manual annotation, which may not accurately reflect the complex nature of political biases. Developing new methods would help in better understanding and addressing the fairness issues resulting from language model political leanings, ensuring that NLP applications do not marginalize certain groups or propagate harmful biases.</sample>

    <sample id="74">The paper introduces Dense-ATOMIC, a densely-connected commonsense knowledge graph that aims to improve knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths in the existing ATOMIC knowledge base. ATOMIC is a large-scale commonsense knowledge base that contains event-centered social aspects of inferential knowledge tuples, but it lacks B-to-B, A-to-B, and A-to-A links, leading to unsatisfactory knowledge coverage despite its high-quality human-annotated commonsense knowledge.

To address this issue, the authors propose Dense-ATOMIC by constructing a densely-connected graph upon ATOMIC. They normalize tail events, train a relation prediction model using RoBERTa, and apply an Intra- and Inter-Cluster Completion Strategy for linkable prediction. The results show that Dense-ATOMIC outperforms relation prediction methods and translation-based methods on both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, Dense-ATOMIC yields higher knowledge coverage and benefits the performance of COMET, generating more diversified results. The paper also evaluates multi-hop paths on Dense-ATOMIC, demonstrating relatively high aggregates of multi-hop paths and better results with heuristic rules. Overall, Dense-ATOMIC has potential for commonsense reasoning and can be used to improve the performance of downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="75">The English content presents a research work titled "Jointprop" by Zheng Yandan, Hao Anran, and Luu Anh Tuan. The motivation behind this work is to address the limitations of supervised learning schemes in name entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) tasks. Supervised learning requires extensive labor for high-quality data annotation and diverse annotated data for various domains and applications. Semi-supervised learning, on the other hand, employs a small amount of labeled data to obtain powerful models at a lower cost.

However, current studies neglect the underlying interconnections between NER and RE tasks. The proposed joint semi-supervised learning framework models the NER and RE tasks by propagating labels over heterogeneous graphs and performs label propagation across the graph, considering the inter- and intra-connections among both labeled and unlabeled data.

The method parts include span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. The experiment part conducted on four datasets shows significant improvement over all baselines, both for NER and relation tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="76">The political bias propagation pipeline involves the following steps: 

1. Pretraining data: Large-scale web crawl data is used for pretraining language models, which includes diverse perspectives and political opinions from various news media sources like New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Huffington Post.

2. Language model training: Language models are trained on this pretraining data, which can lead to varying political leanings among different models.

3. Controlled experiments: By pretraining language models on partisan corpora separated into news and social media, researchers can investigate how political biases of language models are picked up from training data and how they correspondingly shift.

4. Evaluation: Researchers evaluate language models with different political leanings on downstream tasks such as hate speech detection and fake news detection to assess potential fairness issues in NLP applications.

5. Implications: The findings indicate that language models with different political leanings may have varying performance on certain tasks, leading to potential fairness issues in NLP applications.</sample>
    <sample id="77">The video introduces a new dataset called DeFacto, which contains human demonstrations and feedback for improving summarization factual consistency. The dataset is based on the XSum dataset and the initial system outputs are collected from the pre-trained Pegasus model. The annotators provide labels to decide whether the summary is factually consistent and they also provide human-corrected, factually consistent summaries if they think the original summary is not correct. They also provide human feedback which contains instructions, explanation, and evidence. The data statistics show that around 2.5K data points were collected, and 70% of them contain factual errors. The human-edited summaries can receive higher automatic factuality scores compared with the initial system output. However, there is a lower textual overlap between the reference summaries and the human-edited summaries. The video also shows the data distribution of the annotated editing instructions and their relation with the different error types. The first task studied was summary editing, where the model needs to follow the human feedback to edit the initial summary. The second task studied was feedback generation, where a critic model needs to generate the feedback that can be used by the editing model. The third task is to automatically correct factual errors while generating the corresponding explanation. The editor model can achieve comparable performance compared with the baseline models while being trained on much fewer data. Training the model to generate the explanation can help the model to achieve better performance.</sample>

    <sample id="82">This video introduces a new framework for unsupervised automated essay scoring (AES) called ULRA, which aims to improve the performance of AES models by aggregating multiple heuristic quality signals as supervision. The proposed framework consists of two main modules: the Heuristic Essay Ranking Module (HER) and the Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation Module (DPRA). HER generates partial-order pairs by ranking essays according to different heuristic quality signals, while DPRA trains a neural AES model by aggregating these partial-order pairs into a unified supervision. A learnable confidence weight is designed for each signal to measure its importance. In the model inference stage, a Scoring Strategy is proposed to transform the predicted scores into the range of the pre-defined score set through a minimum-maximum transformation. Experiments on both transductive and inductive settings demonstrate that ULRA outperforms all unsupervised baselines with a large improvement.</sample>

    <sample id="84">In this paper, the authors discuss the challenges of implementing dynamic networks and propose a new framework called PAD-Net (Partially Dynamic Network). They argue that fully dynamic networks can be computationally expensive and may contain redundant parameters. To address this issue, they partition the parameters into dynamic and static modes and use an iterative mode partition method to identify redundant dynamic parameters. The authors also introduce scale factors to control the intensity of the two modes and speed up the training process. Experimental results show that PAD-Net achieves better performance than static and fully dynamic networks while maintaining fewer parameters and less computation. The authors also conduct ablation studies to find the optimal dynamic ratios for different dynamic convolution and mixture of experts modules. They compare their method with network pruning and find that their approach maintains more accurate outputs due to the retention of static parameters. The authors believe that their method has potential applications in other mainstream networks and hardware-friendly structured manners.</sample>

    <sample id="90">The paper "Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?" by Haneul Yoo and colleagues explores the feasibility of using language learners as annotators in NLP. The study addresses the challenge of recruiting native speakers for data annotation, particularly in low-resource languages with limited monolingual native speakers. The researchers conducted a proof-of-concept study targeting English, Korean, and Indonesian, selecting tasks from the GLUE benchmark such as sentiment analysis, NLI, NER, and MRC.

The study categorized learners into three levels (basic, intermediate, advanced) based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) criteria. Native speakers were also recruited for comparison. Participants were provided with additional resources like dictionaries or machine translation systems to aid their annotation. The experiments included a pre-test, annotation, and post-test to assess language proficiency and learning effects.

Results showed that language learners' annotations were nearly accurate, especially for simpler tasks and easy-to-medium level questions. Aggregating labels from multiple learners through majority voting brought learner-annotated models close to native speaker-annotated models in performance. Additionally, learners' language proficiency and vocabulary improved significantly over the course of the study.

This research suggests that language learners can effectively contribute to NLP data annotation, potentially broadening NLP research for many languages and overcoming geographic and technological barriers in low-resource languages.</sample>

    <sample id="94">The speaker, Jingwei Yi from the University of Science and Technology of China, introduces a paper on protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding as services via backdoor watermark. The paper addresses the issue of embedding as services, where large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and PALM are used to assist various NLP tasks. However, recent works have shown that attackers can steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services, making it necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services.

To address this issue, the paper proposes Embedding Marker, a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services. The method involves two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. Before these steps, a trigger set is selected, which consists of words with moderate frequency intervals. In watermark injection, a target embedding is defined, and when a user sends a sentence to the provider service, the provider counts the number of triggers in the sentence and provides an embedding that is a weight summation of the target embedding and the original embedding. When the number of triggers in the sentence exceeds a certain threshold, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding. Copyright verification involves constructing a backdoor and benign data set, requesting embeddings from the stealer's service with the data set, and computing the cosine and L2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding. The results show that the proposed method can have great detection performance while keeping great utility for downstream tasks.</sample>

This can be achieved by using balanced datasets that include various sources, such as news articles from different political leanings and social media platforms. Additionally, implementing techniques like data augmentation, debiasing algorithms, and monitoring for bias during model training can help reduce the impact of biases on the final model's performance. However, determining what constitutes neutrality and ensuring fair representation remains a challenging task.</sample>
    <sample id="100">The speaker introduces PromptRank, a data-efficient approach for multi-hop question answering that uses an unsupervised retrieval method combined with a few-shot language model-based reranker. The process involves retrieving candidate chains using TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, then reranking them using the likelihood of the question given the chain prompt. The speaker explains how to construct the chain prompt by inserting documents into a template with an instruction token and instruction text. They explore techniques like instruction search, instruction sampling, and temperature scaling to optimize the process. The speaker evaluates PromptRank on HotpotQA using metrics like R@K recall and answer recall AR@K. They find that PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-hop dense retrievers. The downstream QA performance when using PromptRank as a retriever is also evaluated, showing very good performance underperforming MDR by only around four exact match points.</sample>

    <sample id="108">Koustav Sinha and his team presented their ACL 2023 paper on the limitations of language model acceptability judgments. They revisited the minimal pair paradigm, which evaluates models based on acceptability judgments in shorter contexts. However, modern large language models have longer context windows, so they aimed to assess models' acceptability across longer sequences. To achieve this, they recreated sentences by combining acceptable or unacceptable ones from datasets like BLiMP and SyntaxGym, as well as unrelated domains like Wikipedia. Their results showed that MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context lengths when using Wikipedia sentences. However, when choosing sentences from the same dataset, the MPP judgments significantly increased or decreased depending on the prefix's acceptability. This suggests that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences, highlighting the need for more comprehensive evaluation methods that capture abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The paper introduces Unnatural Instructions, a dataset of natural language instructions and their corresponding inputs and outputs, collected in a fully automatic manner without any human annotations. The data was generated by prompting a pre-trained language model (GPT-3) with examples from the Super-Natural Instructions dataset to create new examples. The dataset contains 64,000 examples, with additional paraphrases increasing the total to about 240,000. The generated examples were analyzed for creativity, diversity, and correctness, with over 50% being correct and many containing valuable information for instruction tuning. The paper also shows that fine-tuning an 11 billion-parameter T5 model on Unnatural Instructions outperforms both T0++ and Tk-instruct across several benchmarks, including Super-Natural Instructions, T0, BIG-Bench Hard, and LMentry. Unnatural Instructions highlights the ability of language models to produce creative and diverse data, which is difficult to obtain with crowd workers who usually collapse into predictable heuristics and form annotation artifacts.</sample>

    <sample id="114">The presentation introduces a research paper titled "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention" presented at ACL 2023 by Nanyang Technological University of Singapore. The paper addresses the issue of large language models being heavy in parameters, requiring long training times and huge corpora. The authors propose a grouped head attention method using a divide-and-conquer strategy to compress multi-head attention. This method involves two stages: group-constrained training and Voting-to-Stay algorithm. The group-constrained training aims to make intra-group heads more similar and inter-group heads more separate, while the Voting-to-Stay algorithm prunes redundant multi-head attention and retains only one head per group. The proposed method achieves significant parameter compression, with up to 90% compression in extreme conditions, without sacrificing performance on machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization tasks. The LITE model also achieves 90% pruned parameters, 62% faster inference speed, and 80% reduction in FLOPs compared to the original model. The researchers believe that task-specific automatic pruning is promising and can be applied to real-world applications where only a few tasks are needed.</sample>

The submission proposes novel MLM techniques tailored to code-switching, including SwitchMLM and FrequencyMLM, which address the limitations of multilingual pre-trained models like mBERT and XLM-R. Architectural modifications and auxiliary losses are also proposed to enhance switch-point information in intermediate layers.

They aimed to investigate if instruction tuning multi-modal pre-trained models can improve generalization to unseen multi-modal tasks. The dataset consists of 62 diverse multi-modal tasks covering 10 broad categories, derived from 21 existing open-source datasets, with each task equipped with five expert-written instructions. They used OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as the base model. For training, they used 53 tasks from 9 groups, sampling 10,000 instances per task. Testing involved reserving the entire common sense reasoning group and selecting additional 5 tasks from VQ and Miscellaneous groups. They reported performance using accuracy for multi-modal classification tasks, Rouge-L for multi-modal generation tasks, and introduced an additional metric called sensitivity. Their main result showed that instruction tuning significantly improved OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks, with better performance and lower sensitivity as the amount of task increases. They also demonstrated the effect of different fine-tuning strategies on model sensitivity. Transfer learning from natural instruction datasets was shown to benefit instruction tuning, achieving much better sensitivity compared to the original OFA model. Overall, they proposed the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset, exploring different transfer learning techniques and introducing a new metric called sensitivity. They are collecting a larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional vision-language tasks and will release it.</sample>
    <sample id="124">Tan Qingyu from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba presented a study on "Towards Benchmarking and Improving the Temporal Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models." The study breaks down temporal reasoning into three levels: time-to-time, time-to-event, and event-to-event. The researchers conducted experiments using LMs like T5-L, FLAN-T5-L, and ChatGPT, focusing on year prediction (L1), month prediction (L1), and event-to-event reasoning (L2 and L3). They proposed the TempReason dataset, which covers all three levels and spans long temporal periods. The study evaluates temporal reasoning in Closed Book QA, Open Book QA, and Reasoning QA settings. To improve temporal reasoning, they introduced a training strategy with Temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning, resulting in the TempT5 model. Experiment results showed that TempT5 outperformed other models in OBQA and Reasoning QA, though performance fluctuations were observed across different time periods. Future work aims to address these biases.</sample>

The paper proposes a method to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models to smaller ones using chain-of-thought prompting and diverse reasoning techniques. The authors argue that while large language models can solve complex tasks, they require significant memory and computation resources, making them impractical for deployment in many situations. To address this issue, the researchers use large models as reasoning teachers to fine-tune smaller models. They generate step-by-step solutions for complex tasks using zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting and reformat these solutions into training samples for the student model. The paper also highlights the effectiveness of diverse reasoning, which involves generating multiple reasoning samples using stochastic temperature sampling to train the student model better. The results show that the proposed method can achieve notable performance on various tasks, even with small models, and is highly scalable. The paper provides detailed analysis and discussion on the trade-offs involved in applying the method to real-world scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="128">The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources is a collaborative work between McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research. The test suite aims to evaluate the ability of natural language understanding models to integrate and use both pretraining-time and inference-time knowledge for knowledge-intensive NLU tasks. The coreference resolution task is designed to probe for this ability.

The test varies the availability of entity-specific and background knowledge in three settings: Background-Pretrain, Background-Both, and Background-Inference. In the Background-Pretrain setting, background knowledge is assumed to be available at pretraining time. In the Background-Both setting, both entity-specific and background knowledge are available at inference time. In the Background-Inference setting, both knowledge types are available only at inference time.

The results show that without task-specific training on KITMUS, most models do not perform well. However, when trained on KITMUS, both C2F and BERT4Coref models perform significantly better than random choice. Additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best-performing models cannot reliably integrate backward knowledge provided only at inference time.

Overall, the main takeaway is that many coreference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training. However, with task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>

    <sample id="135">In this video, James and Sarah Finch introduce ABC-Eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI developed by the Emory NLP Lab led by Professor Jinho Choi at Emory University in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. They explain that traditional methods of human evaluation, such as Likert scale ratings or pairwise comparisons, are used to assess overall dialogue quality but may not provide a detailed understanding of specific dimensions of chat quality. ABC-Eval aims to reduce subjectivity by explicitly annotating whether each model response exhibits certain behaviors like ignoring the partner, contradicting, hallucinating incorrect facts, or violating common sense knowledge.

The researchers evaluated four state-of-the-art chat models on 100 human-bot conversations using ABC-Eval and compared these results with three existing methods: turn-level Likert ratings, dialogue-level Likert ratings, and dialogue-level pairwise comparisons. They found that ABC-Eval behavior labels were more reliable and predictive of conversation quality than the existing methods. The combination of all ABC-Eval metrics explained over 25% of conversation quality, while the combination of all turn-level Likert metrics explained far less.

The video concludes by highlighting the challenges still present in the field, such as common sense violations, irrelevant information, and contradictions, and emphasizes the importance of reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models. The creators hope that ABC-Eval will be leveraged by others in the field to advance conversational AI.</sample>
    <sample id="136">The work presented by Jasivan and Nafise at the University of Sheffield focuses on numerical reasoning in language models. The motivation behind this work is to address the limitations of current benchmarks, which primarily provide accuracy scores that are not informative about a model's mathematical abilities. The researchers introduce FERMAT, a flexible evaluation set based on arithmetic types, including number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency.

FERMAT consists of math worded questions extracted from Illinois and CommonCore, with numbers represented in various formats such as small integers, large integers, and decimals. The researchers evaluate models' performance across different aspects of numerical reasoning, including easier operations and combinations of two operations. They also explore the impact of fine-tuning on model performance and investigate the importance of training templates for diverse language and mathematical operations.

The results show that existing benchmarks are unrepresentative, and single scores do not effectively capture a model's strengths and shortcomings in numerical reasoning. The study highlights the importance of language and mathematical diversity in training data and suggests areas for improvement, such as number encoding and tokenization. Overall, FERMAT provides a more informative alternative to current benchmarks, helping to fill the gap in evaluating numerical reasoning capabilities in language models.</sample>
    <sample id="137">The paper "Tell2Design: A Dataset for Language-Guided Floor Plan Generation" by Sicong from the Singapore University of Technology and Design presents a new machine learning task where a model generates floor plan designs directly from language instructions. The challenge is to create designs that comply with specific requirements, such as semantics, geometry, and topology, while adhering to stricter constraints compared to artwork-like text-conditional image generation.

The Tell2Design dataset consists of 5,051 human-annotated language instructions collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk and around 76,000 artificially generated instructions from pre-defined templates. Each floor plan is associated with collected language instructions, and the average number of words per floor plan exceeds 200.

To address the challenges, the authors propose a sequence-to-sequence model using a transformer-based encoder-decoder structure. This approach allows the model to handle various lengths of instructions and different numbers of rooms. The model is initialized with a pre-trained language model (T5) and uses a normal language modeling objective. The results show that the T2D model achieves the highest IoU scores, outperforming other text-conditional image generation baselines by a large margin.

The paper highlights the importance of addressing the language distribution gap between artificial and human instructions during training. Despite this gap, the model performs significantly better when trained on both types of instructions. The study demonstrates the potential of language-guided design generation and serves as a foundation for future research in this area.</sample>

    <sample id="146">The speaker, Yicheng from Fudan University, is presenting a talk on their research paper about the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization. The talk begins with an introduction to dialogue summarization as a subtask of text summarization, highlighting its importance in various scenarios and domains. The speaker points out that while large-scale pretrained language models have made significant progress in generating fluent and coherent summaries, they often contain factual errors, particularly omissions, which can lead to incomplete summaries.

To address this issue, the speaker's research focuses on systematically analyzing the omission problem in dialogue summarization. They present data showing that even state-of-the-art models have a high omission rate, with about 70% of generated summaries suffering from omissions. The data also indicates that omitted information is randomly distributed throughout the dialogue, regardless of length or domain.

The speaker then introduces the task definition for omission detection, focusing on utterance-level omissions and predicting which utterances are missing in the candidate summary. Since there are no existing datasets for this task, they constructed the OLDS dataset, which includes high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. This dataset is built upon five existing benchmarks covering five domains and includes diverse candidate summaries generated by different models and decoding strategies.

To explore model architectures for omission detection, the researchers used three frameworks: pair-wise classification, sequence labeling, and pointer networks. They evaluated the models using Precision, Recall, and F1-score, as well as a word-level omission recall (WR) score. The results showed a label imbalance problem and a relatively low F1-score, indicating the task's challenge.

The speaker also discusses a post-editing method for summary refinement, where the candidate summary is concatenated with omission content as input, and the model outputs a refined summary. The results indicate that providing omissions significantly improves the summary quality, confirming the value of omission detection and the potential for refinement based on detected omissions.

In conclusion, the speaker highlights the importance of addressing omission in dialogue summarization and presents their research on omission detection and refinement. They emphasize the need for more advanced detection models and the promising direction of refining summaries based on detected omissions.</sample>

The paper addresses the gap in existing works that only focus on summarization and extracting action items, underutilizing the QA component in meeting discussions. The authors introduce a new dataset, MeetingQA, which contains 7.7K questions split between Train, Dev, and Test sets. They collect data from the AMI corpus, selecting questions based on punctuation and filtering out short questions. They recruit annotators to label sentences in the answer span, achieving high inter-annotator agreement. The dataset includes various question types and answer scenarios, such as multiple speakers contributing to the answer, multi-discontinuous sentences forming the answer span, and rhetorical questions. They also show the length distribution of meeting transcripts, questions, and answers in MeetingQA. They employ various methods in their paper, including context-retrieval, single-span models, multi-span variants, and data augmentation using silver annotations. They observe a 25 F1 point gap between fine-tuned models and human performance, and nearly a 50 F1 point gap between zero-shot performance and human performance. They find that silver data augmentation effectively improves zero-shot performance, and larger instruction-tuned models like FLAN-T5 are comparable to other models. Error analysis shows that models struggle with identifying rhetorical questions, especially in the zero-shot setting, and predictions of single-span models contain more irrelevant sentences than their multi-span counterparts. Overall, MeetingQA is an interesting dataset based on open-ended and discussion-seeking questions in real-life meeting scenarios, and it is challenging for existing QA models in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.</sample>

The pipeline involves curating a benchmark dataset with various types of ambiguities, using a prompt disambiguation framework to gather external signals through clarifying questions or generating different possible visual setups. The disambiguated prompts are then input into a text-to-image model to generate images, which are evaluated for faithfulness to user intention using an automatic evaluation framework. The findings show that resolving ambiguities has a positive effect on faithful generation and that the automatic evaluation framework is reliable.</sample>

    <sample id="157">The speaker introduces a joint work titled "Dialogue Summarization with Static-Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph" from Shandong University. The work aims to distill salient information from a dialogue context into a concise summary, addressing the challenge of summarizing semi-structured and multi-participant dialogues. The existing methods mainly focus on modeling dialogues with pre-computed static graph structures using external linguistic tools, which have two fundamental drawbacks: reliance on the accuracy of these tools and the disjointness between static graph construction and graph representation learning.

The proposed SDDS model consists of four main components: an Utterance Encoder for encoding utterances into vector representations, a Static-Dynamic Graph module that combines multiple static graphs and captures semantic relationships dynamically, and a Summary Generator that uses a pre-trained language model to integrate the static and dynamic dialogue structures into the final summary. The model employs various heuristic dialogue structure modeling methods, including Discourse Parsing Graph, speaker relationship modeling, utterance position graph, and relative distance as edge features. It also proposes a Dynamic Graph module using a multi-head attention model to capture semantic relationships based on deep vector representations. The fusion method integrates the relation matrix of the dynamic graph and the adjacent matrix of the static graph into a unified graph, and the graph attention layer is used to incorporate the graph representation in the generation process. The code and data are available on GitHub for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="158">The speaker, Qipeng Guo from AWS, introduces a work titled "Dual Cache for Long Document Neural Coreference Resolution." The coreference resolution task involves identifying mentions of entities in a document and clustering them based on their reference to the same entity. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity for both computation and memory consumption, while cache-based methods use a fixed-size cache to reduce complexity to a linear level. However, in long documents with multiple topic switches, the LRU policy used in cache-based methods leads to high cache misses due to scattered mentions of entities.

To address this issue, the proposed dual cache system consists of a local cache and a global cache that work together. The local cache uses an LRU eviction policy to store local entities, while the global cache uses an LFU policy to store global entities. When a new mention is encountered, it is classified as either a new entity or an updated entity. If qualified, it is added to the global cache; otherwise, it is added to the local cache. Whenever the cache is full, the eviction policy is triggered to remove an entity from the cache.

The dual cache system has been evaluated on four public benchmarks, with three of them containing training data. The results show that the model with unbounded memory performs slightly better without training data, but the dual cache is still faster. The performance gap between the baseline and dual cache is larger for book-level documents, and the dual cache significantly reduces cache misses compared to a single cache. Despite the trade-offs between model efficiency and performance, the dual cache has the highest performance/cost ratio.</sample>

    <sample id="165">The paper presents an unsupervised learning method called LiPoR (Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization) for abductive reasoning in a closed-world setting. The method treats explanations as latent variables and maximizes the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context by marginalizing other possible explanations. To prefer plausible explanations, a regularizer is introduced to enforce mutual exclusivity among explanations. The LiPoR objective consists of maximizing the likelihood of outcomes and preferring some explanations over others. The paper compares LiPoR to zero-shot models and the previous best unsupervised approach on AlphaNLI, achieving over 4 absolute points in accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="166">Hello everyone, I'm Yunxin from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen. Today, I'm excited to introduce our new work titled "A Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Framework for Image Retrieval from Linguistically Complex Text." This task is challenging due to the similarity of images and the length of the descriptions. Typical methods like visual language models perform well on image-sentence retrieval tasks but struggle with linguistically complex text. Inspired by the Divide-and-Conquer strategy and Dual-Process Theory, we propose a method that integrates the advantages of both analogical reasoning (System 1) and logical reasoning (System 2). Our framework includes a Proposition Generator, Visual-Linguistic Interactor, and Neural-Symbolic Reasoner. The Proposition Generator decomposes complex text into simple propositions, which are then processed by System 1 and System 2 to obtain the final solution. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms other baselines. We also present two cases to verify the performance of our method. In conclusion, we suggest that neural symbolic calculation may improve compositional reasoning and planning in large language models, and that the Divide-and-Conquer strategy can be integrated with Dual-Process Theory. Thank you.</sample>

    <sample id="169">David Vilar and his colleagues from Google Translate presented a paper on the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for machine translation. They conducted a systematic study using the best practices of the MT community, comparing PaLM's performance to state-of-the-art systems. The paper highlights the importance of prompt selection strategies in LLMs for translation, with differences up to 40 BLEURT points observed between different prompts. The researchers found that example quality is more important than similarity to the source sentence in zero and one-shot prompting, while five-shot prompting shows nearly no difference in form. They also compared selecting prompts from training data versus curated dev data, finding better performance with dev data. While specialized state-of-the-art systems still outperform PaLM, it comes close to a commercial system. Human evaluation showed that PaLM's fluency is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but accuracy is the main difference, with omission errors being the most common. Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the performance of LLMs for translation and recommendations for prompt selection strategies.</sample>

    <sample id="179">The English content discusses the development of a method called SymbolicToM, which aims to improve Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning skills in large language models (LLMs). ToM is the ability to reason about the mental state of others, and it is traditionally measured through reading comprehension tasks involving multiple characters. False-belief questions are situations where reality may not match the belief of certain story characters.

The research question addressed is "How can we improve Theory of Mind reasoning skills in Large Language Models?" The proposed solution is SymbolicToM, an inference-time method that uses explicit graphical representations to enhance ToM reasoning. These graphical representations include beliefs about the current world state and beliefs about other characters' beliefs. By pre-computing these graphs for a given story, the method efficiently answers any given question.

Experiments were conducted using various LLMs, including GPT-3, Macaw, and Flan-T5-XXL, comparing the performance with supervised baselines like fine-tuned GPT-3 model and Textual Time Travel. The results showed significant performance gains across all models, with accuracy points gained ranging from 51 to 67. Additionally, the method demonstrated robustness in out-of-domain setups and linguistic generalization.

In conclusion, SymbolicToM is introduced as a plug-and-play method to improve ToM reasoning in LLMs, offering more interpretable reasoning and significantly enhancing out-of-the-box LLM performance.</sample>

    <sample id="181">The paper "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning" by Siyu Yuan and colleagues presents a study on the problem of constrained language planning, where specific goals with multi-faceted constraints need to be planned for. The authors evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models using InstructGPT. They find that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed. To address this, they propose an over-generate-then-filter method to improve generation quality. They also create a dataset named CoScript, which consists of 55,000 specific goals with scripts, to enable smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning. The results show that T5 fine-tuned on CoScript can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models. The CoScript dataset is expected to be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="192">Yang Luo's presentation introduces a new optimizer called CAME (Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization) designed to address the challenge of balancing fast convergence and low memory usage in training large language models. The presentation highlights that traditional adaptive gradient-based optimizers like Adam require triple the memory for keeping first and second moment estimates, while memory-efficient optimizers like Adafactor reduce auxiliary memory usage but at the cost of performance.

CAME aims to achieve both fast convergence and low memory usage by introducing an efficient approach to handle erroneous updates, which are common in memory-efficient optimizers. The presenter explains how CAME uses the residual between predicted and generated updates to adaptively adjust the updating step, thereby reducing the side effects of insecure updating and improving stability during training.

The presentation includes experiments on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, comparing CAME with existing optimizers like Adam and Adafactor. Results show that CAME achieves significant improvements in validation accuracy and better performance in pre-training very large models, especially when using larger batch sizes. The memory footprint of CAME is also shown to be lower compared to other memory-efficient optimizers, making it particularly effective for large batch training.

Overall, the presentation demonstrates that CAME is a promising optimizer for large language model training tasks, offering a balance between fast convergence and low memory usage, and performing well even with large batch sizes.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The work presented is called "Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree for Explainable Question Answering" (RoHT). This research aims to answer complex questions and provide explanations for the answers. The current methods in XQA can be categorized into two directions: neuro-symbolic methods, which translate natural language questions into formal representations like SPARQL, and decompose-based methods, which generate intermediate steps leading to the final answer by breaking down complex questions into sub-questions.

However, these methods have limitations. Neuro-symbolic methods struggle with recall due to incomplete knowledge bases, while decompose-based methods face challenges in integrating knowledge from diverse sources and selecting appropriate knowledge sources for each sub-question. RoHT addresses these issues by proposing a novel framework that integrates knowledge from heterogeneous sources and flexibly selects the appropriate knowledge source for each sub-question.

The RoHT framework consists of two stages: firstly, building the Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT) to understand the hierarchical compositional structure of a complex question; secondly, performing probabilistic reasoning over HQDT to fuse knowledge from a knowledge base and a text corpus at different levels. The framework evaluates the certainty score of each node based on its likelihood and performs probabilistic reasoning from the root to leaves in a recursive way.

The RoHT framework has been evaluated on two challenging QA datasets, KQA Pro and Musique. On the KQA Pro dataset, RoHT outperforms existing KB QA methods when using an incomplete KB and Wikipedia as supplementary text. On the Musique dataset, RoHT improves F1 by 11.9 compared to the SOTA method EX(SA) when using both text and Wikidata as supplementary knowledge sources. Overall, RoHT demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing knowledge from KB and text together and provides superior performance compared to TransferNet.</sample>

    <sample id="205">The presentation by Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, focuses on the political biases in language models and their impact on downstream tasks. The speaker explains that language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which includes diverse perspectives from various news media sources, such as New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Huffington Post. This diversity can lead to socially biased models that may cause fairness issues in NLP applications.

To address these concerns, the presentation proposes an investigation into the political bias propagation pipeline from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks. The research aims to evaluate the political leanings of language models and determine the role of pretraining data in shaping these biases. It also explores how language models with different political leanings perform on downstream tasks like hate speech detection and fake news detection.

Preliminary results indicate that language models exhibit varying political leanings, with GPT-4 being the most liberal. The study further investigates the extent to which political biases are picked up from training data by pretraining language models on partisan corpora. For example, RoBERTa pre-trained on left-leaning Reddit data shows a substantial liberal shift in its political biases.

The presentation concludes by highlighting the fairness issues arising from language model political leanings and the dilemma of sanitizing political opinions in training data without risking censorship or exclusion.</sample>

Przepiórkowski explains the principle of dependency length minimization, which states that shorter dependencies are preferred. He uses examples to illustrate how direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away. He also discusses how the tendency for left conjuncts to be shorter occurs when the governor is on the left or absent.

    <sample id="217">Weihao Zeng, Lulu Zhao, and Keqing He from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications introduced their work on "Seen to Unseen: Exploring Compositional Generalization of Multi-Attribute Controllable Dialogue Generation." They addressed the limitations of previous methods that focus on single attributes or specific labels for continuous attributes. Their contributions include proposing DCG (Disentangled Controllable Generation), which learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses a disentanglement loss to disentangle different attribute combinations. They also introduced a unified evaluation framework, MAE, for evaluating different granularities of attributes without additional labeled data. The model is based on DialoGPT with compositional prompt modules, using two types of prompts: attribute-oriented and task-oriented. Attribute-oriented prompts guide the model's focus on specific information, while task-oriented prompts improve text equality. Disentanglement learning enhances the ability of compositional generalization. Experiments showed that DCG outperforms baselines in attribute controllability and text equality, successfully tackling challenges in compositional generalization for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation.</sample>

    <sample id="219">Jia-Huei Ju, a research assistant at Academia Sinica, presented their work on "A Compare-and-contrast Multistage Pipeline for Uncovering Financial Signals in Financial Reports" along with Yu-Shiang Huang, Cheng-Wei Lin, and their advisors Professors Che Lin and Chuan-Ju Wang. The goal of this work is to analyze financial reports, specifically the Form 10-K required by the SEC, which contains detailed information about companies' activities. The challenge lies in extracting useful information from these reports, which requires significant human effort.

The motivation behind this work stems from two observations: 80% of tokens in company reports are similar, and the content is yearly-dependent. To address this, the researchers introduced a highlighting task and a multi-stage pipeline. They defined reference-to-target structures, where the target is the report of interest and the reference is the previous year's report. The highlighting model aims to compare and contrast the context between targets and references to find rationale words that indicate relations between given pairs (T and R).

The proposed pipeline consists of four stages: document segmentation, relation recognition, out-of-domain fine-tuning, and in-domain fine-tuning. Stage 0 (document segmentation) is not discussed due to time constraints. In Stage 1, all pairs are classified into three types: β (highest syntactic and semantic similarities), revised (similar syntactical patterns but different meanings), and mismatched (new operations or debut of information).

For model tuning, an external dataset (eSNLI) is used for out-of-domain fine-tuning, followed by intermediate fine-tuning using revised pairs as pseudo positive labels and randomly labeling other scores as negative. Different objectives are mixed using soft labeling techniques to alleviate low-quality pseudo-labels. The evaluation dataset includes eSNLI pairs and the FINAL dataset, with performance judged by precision and PCC metrics.

The domain-adaptive highlighting model achieved the best performance on the FINAL dataset and maintained generalization capability. The methods also benefited from simulation with mismatched pairs during training. Future works include improving effectiveness, adding more features, and enhancing information retrieval applications.

    <sample id="227">The audio discusses the current limitations of language models in grounded language understanding, where a natural language expression is mapped to an executable plan or program. Examples include smart assistants like Siri and Alexa, semantic search on Google, querying medical databases, and domestic robots following natural language instructions. The main challenge is the lack of grounding during pre-training, which makes it difficult for language models to generate valid plans. Existing research typically uses language models to directly generate plans, but this often results in invalid or ungrammatical plans. The proposed framework, Pangu, focuses on discrimination instead of generation, where a symbolic agent proposes candidate plans and a language model scores and ranks them. This approach allows language models to excel at discrimination tasks and improves performance in grounded language understanding. The framework has been tested with different language models and fine-tuning methods, demonstrating strong sample efficiency and robustness under non-i.i.d settings. The audio concludes by emphasizing that generation may not be the best strategy for grounded language understanding and that discrimination might be a more effective approach.</sample>

They explore four main challenges: Representativity and Reliability, Model Complexity and Architecture, Contextual Information, and Topical and User Bias. They conclude that revision-based data can be effectively employed for the given tasks, and modeling the distance between two claimed versions is beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims. Additionally, they emphasize that the impact of contextual information is dependent on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from.</sample>

The proposed solution is EDAtt, or Encoder-Decoder Attention, which uses existing offline ST models without re-training or specific architecture for SimulST. EDAtt decides whether to emit partial translations based on cross-attention mechanisms between audio input and textual output. The strategy aims to balance translation quality, latency, and computational efficiency, outperforming popular offline strategies like Wait-k and Local Agreement.

    <sample id="241">Ethan, along with Yang Chen, Wei Xu, and Alan Ritter from Georgia Tech, presented a paper titled "Human-in-the-loop Evaluation for Early Misinformation Detection: A Case Study of COVID-19 Treatments." The paper addresses the limitations of current misinformation detection systems, which often fail to accurately evaluate their performance using live data and lack human-centric evaluation. Ethan proposed an end-to-end evaluation framework that involves humans at various stages of the process, making it more representative of real-world social media platforms. The system consists of two main components: claim detection and policy violation verification. Claim detection uses keyword filtering and a T5 model trained for question answering to extract potential check-worthy claims, while policy violation verification uses a BERT-based stance classification model to flag tweets supporting unapproved treatments for human review. The evaluation of the workflow showed that the system effectively detects early instances of misinformation and identifies policy violations with high accuracy. The framework provides a realistic representation of the interplay between systems and human content moderators, and aims to motivate the development of future human-in-the-loop misinformation detection systems.</sample>

The authors constructed some baselines in two ways: Claim Only baselines use only the claims to verify, without graph evidence, and the GEAR model to verify the claim using correct evidence. The results show that all of the baselines outperform the majority class baseline, and the GEAR model that uses graph evidence outperforms all other baselines.</sample>

    <sample id="252">The presentation introduces "U-CREAT: Unsupervised Case Retrieval using Events extrAcT," a joint work by Sai Kiran Tanikella, Abhinav Joshi, Akshat Sharma, and Ashutosh Modi. The work focuses on Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) in the legal domain, where retrieving relevant past precedents from a large candidate pool is challenging due to the increasing volume of cases. The presentation highlights two key contributions: the IL-PCR dataset and the U-CREAT pipeline.

The IL-PCR dataset, an Indian Legal Prior Case Retrieval Dataset, contains 7,070 legal cases with an average of 6.775 citations per query document. It serves as a comprehensive test bed for evaluating PCR algorithms, offering a larger pool of cases, longer documents, a larger vocabulary, and more citations compared to existing datasets like COLIEE’21.

The U-CREAT pipeline leverages unsupervised learning techniques and introduces an event-based approach for PCR tasks. It demonstrates high retrieval efficiency, low inference time, and generalization across Indian and Canadian legal systems without requiring law or demographic-specific tuning. The pipeline includes three steps: pre-processing, dependency parsing, and post-processing, which extract events from query and candidate documents. These events are then used to compute an interaction matrix, which is used in different retrieval models to rank candidates.

Experiments were conducted using various models, including count-based, transformer-based, and event-based models. The best-performing models within each grouping were identified, with event-based models outperforming baseline methods. The Event Filtered Documents model was found to be the best overall, providing significant performance boosts and lower inference times compared to other techniques.

The presentation concludes by highlighting the significance of U-CREAT's contributions and its potential for further exploration and development in the field of prior case retrieval.</sample>
    <sample id="253">Mario Ezra Aragón and a team of researchers from Mexico and Spain have developed a model called "DisorBERT" that aims to detect signs of mental disorders in social media posts. The model uses domain adaptation to improve its performance on a target domain, such as Reddit and mental health, by integrating information from a base language model trained on general data like Wikipedia and Google Books. The model incorporates knowledge from a lexicon to guide the masking process, allowing it to focus on important words during training. The results show that DisorBERT has better balance between precision and recall compared to other methods, and it tends to generate more negative meaning or psychological orientation when given sentences with masked words. The visualization tool used in this study provides an interactive head view in the form of a graph, allowing users to observe the most prominent words related to mental disorders in social media interactions. The evaluation shows that DisorBERT obtained better results than MentalBERT, a model trained with a large amount of data. Future work will explore the application of different lexical resources and clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="254">The research work presented today is titled "Uncertainty Guided Label Denoising for Document-level Distant Relation Extraction" by Sun Qi from Nanjing University of Science and Technology. The primary focus of this work is to improve the label quality of Distant Supervised (DS) data in document-level relation extraction, which is a challenging task due to the presence of various noise levels in DS data. The proposed framework incorporates uncertainty estimation to determine the trustworthiness of model predictions and employs an instance-level uncertainty estimation method to capture uncertainty scores for overlapping relations. Additionally, it introduces dynamic class uncertainty thresholds to filter pseudo labels with high uncertainty and designs a multi-phase training strategy to iteratively re-label DS data. The framework is compared with several strong baselines on public datasets, demonstrating superior performance. The main contributions of this work include the development of a framework with uncertainty-guided label denoising, an instance-level uncertainty estimation method for overlapping relations, an iterative re-label strategy with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds for the long-tail problem, and significant performance improvements.</sample>

    <sample id="258">In this video, Chiang Cheng-Han introduces a new work titled "Can Large Language Models Be an Alternative to Human Evaluation?" The research proposes using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the quality of text in natural language processing tasks. LLMs are instructed with specific ratings based on attributes such as grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance. The experiment involves using LLMs like GPT-2, InstructGPT (curie and davinci), and ChatGPT to rate stories generated by humans or GPT-2. Ground-truth ratings from human evaluators, specifically English teachers, are used for comparison. The results show that larger LLMs, such as Davinci and ChatGPT, exhibit a clear preference for human-written texts over those generated by GPT-2, similar to human evaluators. The video also mentions that further details about agreement between LLMs and human evaluators, the impact of instruction wording changes, sampling methods, benefits, costs, and results on other tasks can be found in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="259">Yusen Zhang from Penn State University presented a work titled "XSemPLR: Cross-Lingual Semantic Parsing in Multiple Natural Languages and Meaning Representations." The presentation focused on semantic parsing, which involves building semantic representations of user queries such as SQL and Lambda Calculus. Cross-Lingual Semantic Parsing is the task of translating queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations.

The existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on data sets of limited tasks and applications, often lacking coverage for certain natural languages or meaning representations. To address this, XSemPLR was proposed, providing a uniform data set for cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations. It contains 9 datasets in various domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 natural languages in 15 language families.

The presentation also discussed six settings for training and evaluation, including Translate-Test, Monolingual Model, Monolingual Few-shot, Multilingual Model, Cross-lingual Zero-shot, and Cross-lingual Few-shot transfer. The results showed that Encoder-Decoder models outperformed previous work or achieved comparable results, and pre-training on English natural language can significantly boost the performance of Few-shot on target natural languages. However, multilingual language models such as Codex and BLOOM are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="263">The paper presents a work on mitigating label biases for in-context learning, which is a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models. The authors identify three types of label biases: vanilla-label bias, context-label bias, and domain-label bias. They propose a novel calibration method called domain-context calibration to handle all types of biases. The method uses random in-domain words sampled from the task corpus as content-free text to estimate the model's bias on each label name and then calibrates the model's original predictions. The authors conduct experiments using different models on a wide range of datasets and observe that domain-context calibration improves significantly the average performance of in-context learning, especially on tasks with larger domain-label bias. The paper proposes a systematic investigation of label bias problems in in-context learning and provides a calibration method that can significantly improve the performance of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="264">Lin Wang, a graduate student at Zhejiang University, China, presented a paper titled "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation." The presentation addressed the challenges of multimodal text generation tasks like audio-visual text generation, which suffer from severe degradation due to varying construction conditions in different domains. To overcome this constraint, the proposed task named Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation aims to train a model that can quickly adapt to new multimodal domains with limited labeled data.

The framework consists of three components: an audio-visual meta-mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model generator, and counterfactual contrastive learning. The audio-visual meta-mapper network maps different visual concepts across domains into a unified auditory semantic space, addressing shifts in the semantic distribution. The second model uses a transformer-based encoder and generator, introducing an alpha to evaluate the contribution of different modalities to each word. The third component is Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCLL), which constructs fine-grained supervision signals from counterfactual results to directly optimize the visual-textual alignment without relying on the quality of randomly-selected negative samples.

Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks based on MSVD and MSR-VTT, including cross-datasets and cross-domain settings. The results showed that TAVT outperformed all compared models on all metrics by a large margin on both settings. Additionally, TAVT performed well even in low-resource domains with only a few labeled data, such as "Kids" and "Beauty," while other methods suffered from severe performance degradation.</sample>

They focused on evaluating translation metrics for Indian languages, specifically Tamil, Malayalam (Dravidian), and Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati (Indo-Aryan). Using the Flores dataset, they selected 200 sentences randomly and generated 1,400 candidate translations in English using seven different translation models. Human annotators evaluated these translations, marking errors, severity, and overall scores. The study found that newer models like NLLB and Indic Trans had fewer errors compared to older models. COMET-metric variants showed the highest overall correlations with human scores across all languages. The team fine-tuned COMET using their MQM dataset, resulting in better performance than COMET baselines. They also tested IndicCOMET's zero-shot ability and found it more robust than COMET counterparts.</sample>

They addressed challenges such as the complementarity of multimodal information, unsatisfactory performances in minority emotion classes, and difficulty distinguishing between semantically similar emotions.

Key contributions include a novel visual feature extractor (VisExtNet), a multimodal fusion model (MultiAttn) based on bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers, and a Sample-Weighted Focal Contrast loss to improve classification of minority and semantically similar emotions. MultiEMO achieved state-of-the-art performance on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets. Limitations include VisExtNet's inability to distinguish between speakers and irrelevant people, SWFC loss requiring a large batch size on MELD, and still underperforming in minority emotions compared to majority classes.</sample>
    <sample id="281">The work presented by Kayo Yin and collaborators explores the role of context in translation, particularly focusing on cases where word meanings can change based on surrounding text. They introduce Pointwise Contextual Mutual Information (P-CXMI) to measure how much a word depends on its context during translation. By analyzing TED talk transcripts translated into 14 languages, they identify patterns such as dual pronouns in Arabic and formality in translations. They also develop the Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) tagger to automatically identify discourse phenomena like formality and lexical cohesion. Evaluating models using MuDA, they find that context-aware models outperform context-agnostic ones for certain phenomena but not others. The study concludes that MuDA can help improve document-level translation systems by identifying and handling context-dependent translation challenges.</sample>
    <sample id="282">The paper presents a new approach to non-parallel text style transfer at the discourse level, addressing the challenge of imitating author linguistic preferences in long texts. The authors propose a generation model called StoryTrans, which learns discourse representations from source texts and combines them with learnable style embeddings to generate texts in target styles. They also introduce a new training objective that reduces stylistic features from discourse representations and enhances content preservation by separating the generation process into two stages. The first stage involves transferring the source text with style-specific content keywords masked, while the second stage focuses on filling in the correct style-specific contents and removing mask tokens. The evaluation results show that StoryTrans outperforms strong baselines in terms of style control and content preservation, and it can rewrite most sentences with the target style while maintaining the source semantics.</sample>

    <sample id="284">Hello everyone. I'm Peng Tianshuo from Wuhan University. Today I will present my long paper for ACL's Main Conference 4,915 titled "FSUIE: A Novel Fuzzy Span Mechanism for Enhancing Universal Information Extraction". The current span-based UIE models involves identifying and labeling the span boundaries of the targets in the text, which overrelies on boundary positions of the annotated span. However, there is ambiguity in labeling the golden span boundary. That is, different annotation spans can be considered reasonable. So we proposed that the span boundary learned by the module should be fuzzy instead of precise. Besides, there is a mismatch between transformer feature extraction and information extraction. Basic Transformers focus on global features, which ignores the prior hypothesis that span has limited length. So we proposed that the attention used for span extraction decision should be adaptive rather than static in order to model the furthest span boundary, which represents the target boundary as a continuous distribution of correct probability in a specific range, where R-min and R-max represent the start and end of the fuzzy boundary. And the function Q represents the correctness of the current position. Through the sampling function shared in the slide, we convert the continuous boundary distribution into a group of discrete values for calculation of fuzzy span loss. The boundary distribution predicted by the module will calculate Binary Cross Entropy with golden boundary as BCE loss and adding KL-divergence between predicted boundary with fuzzy span boundary and supplementary information. To get the model in obtaining a more reasonable attention distribution for span extraction, we proposed a fuzzy span attention as a mask function to trim attention distribution. The image and formula of the mask function G are shown in the slide, where the fuzzy span is reflected in two aspects. On the one hand, by introducing an optimizable parameter delta to adjust the length of the full attention range, the attention span of the module is dynamically changing. On the other hand, the attention distribution on the attention span boundary linearly decays, rather than truncates. The overall structure of the module is presented on the slide, where the fuzzy span attention layer is only added on the top level to guide the model's decision process without affecting the text encoding capability. To demonstrate the capability of FSUIE, we conduct experiments on three main information extraction tasks, including named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction. As for the results of named entity recognition, by introducing FSL and FSA, our FSUIE-base achieved significant performance improvement compared to UIE-base without a fuzzy span mechanism. On small-scale data size, the model is easier to learn universal attention spans, resulting in a more significant improvement. As a result, on relationship extraction, FSUIE achieves new sota results on datasets ACE2004, 2005, and ADE. FSUIE uses one unified structure to extract relationship elements, achieving better information extraction ability with simple structure. Besides, FSUIE shows stronger generalization capabilities for domain-specific information. As for results on ASTE tasks, FSUIE also achieves sota results on 14lap, 15res, and 16res of AST-V2 dataset, and demonstrates competitive performance on 14res datasets. The results of the ablation study shows that FSA improves convergence speed by guiding the module to obtain a reasonable attention distribution. FSL enables the module to fully utilize annotation information and obtain greater information extraction capability. The combined effect of the two will produce a greater enhancement. We also visualized the attention distribution of a fuzzy span attention layer. Results show that the module focused on semantic information within a limited range of preceding tokens. This meets our expectations. In conclusion, in this work, we first proposed a novel fuzzy span loss that alleviates the model's reliance on span boundaries, and then we proposed efficient fuzzy span attention to adaptively adjusting the attention span of the model. And the FSUIE we proposed achieves excellent results in a wide range of IE tasks. Thank you for your listening.</sample>
    <sample id="285">The video discusses the work of Mingqi Gao from Peking University on "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation Framework." The video highlights the importance of correcting factual errors in dialogue summaries, as existing models and reference summaries often contain errors. Two main solutions are discussed: introducing factuality-related objectives during training or inference to generate more factually correct summaries, and designing a Factual Error Correction (FEC) model that takes the source document and model-generated summary as input and outputs a corrected summary.

The video argues that current FEC models have flaws in their evaluation methods, such as using factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE, which provide overall scores and may not be reliable. Additionally, these metrics blur the line between the two types of solutions, as FEC models can ignore the content of the original summary and directly generate a different but more factually correct summary.

To address these issues, the video proposes introducing manually annotated reference corrections to provide more valuable data for training FEC models and create conditions for a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of performance. A new taxonomy of factual errors is proposed, including content-based and form-based categories. The video also discusses experiments with FEC models in different training modes and key findings, such as the need to change evaluation methods and the struggle of current FEC models to correct factual errors like addition.</sample>

They characterize dogwhistles by register, type, and persona, and conduct a case study of historical U.S. political speeches, finding that the frequency of racial dogwhistles correlates with the Republican Southern Strategy post-Civil Rights era. They also evaluate the performance of language models like GPT-3 in recognizing dogwhistles, noting that it varies depending on the register and type of dogwhistle.

    <sample id="299">The paper presents a new training method to improve the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models by reducing their reliance on shortcuts. The proposed method, called minimax training, uses a learner and an auxiliary model in an alternating optimization process. The learner aims to minimize the NLI task loss, while the auxiliary tries to maximize the learner's loss by generating example weights that emphasize under-represented hard examples. This approach helps the learner focus on patterns that contradict shortcuts, improving out-of-distribution performance without making assumptions about the type of shortcuts present in the dataset. The method is evaluated on three analytic datasets and their corresponding adversarial test sets, showing consistent improvements over ERM training and shortcut mitigation methods. The paper also explores the effect of pre-training the learner, the size of the auxiliary, and conducts qualitative evaluations of the learned example weight distribution.</sample>

The task is formalized as a four-step procedure: ASR recognition module, speech transcript segmentation, command extraction and normalization, and execution of each dictation and command utterance until the final document state is reached. A dataset was collected using a new interface designed for this task, and a baseline system was created by training separate models for each step.

    <sample id="305">Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University in Germany, presents their recent work on weakly supervised learning (WSL). They discuss the challenges of using weak labeling sources, which are cheaper but noisy, and how training neural networks directly on such data can lead to memorization of label noise and poor generalization. The paper addresses three research questions: whether clean validation data is necessary for WSL, how many clean samples are required, and whether clean samples should only be used for validation. Their findings indicate that clean validation samples are necessary for WSL methods to perform well, with 20 samples per class typically sufficient for high performance. They also show that fine-tuning on clean samples can achieve better performance than complex WSL methods, making it a simpler and more practical approach. The paper recommends reporting model selection criteria, comparing with few-shot learning baselines, considering continuous fine-tuning, and open-sourcing code.</sample>

They highlight the importance of an agent understanding which entities are mentioned and how their state changes as a discourse unfolds, using the example of a recipe where ingredients end up in a bowl after being mixed. The researchers aim to determine the extent to which large language models can track entities. They address challenges in designing an evaluation task, such as avoiding common patterns in pre-training data, preventing simple heuristic associations, and blocking memorization or heuristics during fine-tuning. Their task involves boxes and objects, where the model predicts the contents of each box based on initial descriptions and state-changing operations. Experiments with Flan-T5 and GPT-3/3.5 show that only text-davinci-003 exhibits non-trivial tracking behavior. The researchers found that GPT-3.5 models trained on substantial amounts of code exhibit this capacity, while smaller models like T5-base can learn it through direct fine-tuning. However, randomly initialized models cannot learn the task even with direct supervision. The paper includes more results and analysis, including GPT-4 experiments, and is available on arXiv.</sample>

    <sample id="308">The presentation by Jenny, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, focuses on the work "NLPositionality," which characterizes design biases in datasets and models. The research, conducted in collaboration with Sebastian Santy, Ronan Le Bras, Katharina Reinecke, and Maarten Sap from the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, explores how NLP models can exhibit systemic performance differences between populations due to the positionality of researchers and developers.

Positionality refers to the perspectives shaped by demographics, identity, and life experiences, which can influence research decisions and outcomes. While models themselves do not have demographic identities, they aggregate judgments and opinions of real people, potentially representing certain positionalities over others. The study aims to address this issue by comparing end-user annotations with existing datasets and models using a framework called NLPositionality.

The framework involves two main steps: re-annotating data sets with diverse annotators and comparing these annotations to models and datasets using Pearson's R correlation score. This approach differs from annotator disagreement literature, as it focuses on comparing end users with models and datasets rather than just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions.

The study utilized Lab in the Wild, an online experimentation platform, to recruit diverse volunteers from 87 countries. Over 16,000 annotations from 1000 annotators were collected for tasks such as social acceptability and toxicity/hate speech detection. Results indicate that there is positionality in NLP, with models and data sets aligning more closely with English-speaking countries and individuals with higher educational backgrounds. However, some populations, such as non-binary individuals, are less aligned with these models and data sets.

To address these findings, the presentation recommends keeping records of all relevant design choices throughout the research process, conducting NLP research through the lens of perspectivism, and building specialized datasets and models within specific communities. The presentation concludes by emphasizing that inclusive NLP is essential for ensuring that technologies work for everyone.</sample>

    <sample id="317">The English content presents a research paper by Peng Li from Fudan University, titled "CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information Extractors." The paper discusses the challenges in traditional information extraction models that use pre-trained language models like T5 and GPT-3, which operate in a text-to-text manner during pre-training. However, during inference, these models struggle with generating the correct structured output due to mismatched outputs between text and structured formats.

To address this issue, the researchers propose CodeIE, which transforms the text-to-structured information extraction task into a structure-to-structure code generation task using code large language models like Codex. This approach ensures aligned structures in both input and output stages, making it easier to convert text to a structured format.

The paper evaluates the proposed method on three named entity recognition datasets and four relation extraction datasets, comparing it with traditional baseline models like UIE and GPT-3. The results show that the proposed approach using code language models and code format prompts significantly outperforms the traditional baseline models, especially in few-shot scenarios.

The analysis also reveals that perplexity computed on text format inputs using models like T5 is generally higher than that of code format samples using models like CodeT5. Additionally, using Codex and code format prompts results in fewer structural errors compared to using GPT-3 and text format prompts. The paper concludes by highlighting the superior performance of the Codex model over the GPT-3 model in information extraction tasks overall.</sample>

    <sample id="322">Enrico will present at ACL 23 on the topic of "What does a Text Classifier Learn about Morality?" He begins by explaining that human morality is our internal compass that helps us distinguish right from wrong, and it's essential for our societies. He then discusses how current approaches in NLP treat morality as a singular scale between immoral and moral, which can hide the pluralist nature of morality. Enrico introduces the Moral Foundation Theory, which posits that there are five different ways humans perceive morality, each prioritized differently by individuals. He explains that this theory has been applied to natural language processing and aims to understand how language models learn about morality. The presentation will focus on understanding how morality is expressed differently across domains using explainable AI techniques. Enrico highlights an experiment comparing the moral expressions in #AllLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter, showing that language models recognize domain-specific differences in moral subversion. He concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing these differences to avoid misunderstandings in morality classification.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The paper titled "Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense QA" by Yujie Wang from Shanxi University, China, addresses the challenge of Commonsense QA by integrating knowledge from both language models and knowledge bases. The authors propose a method called DHLK that builds an HKG (Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph) based on multiple knowledge bases using a two-stage pruning strategy and KRL to optimize structure and knowledge representation. They use RoBERTa and Mask Self-Attention to encode and fuse QA contexts and entities, dynamically removing less relevant entities. The HKG is optimized using TransE, and the authors introduce Relation Mask Self-Attention (RMSA) to model subgraphs. The final answer prediction incorporates HKG path information into the QA context. Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA using external knowledge bases like ConceptNet, WordNet, and Wiktionary show that DHLK achieves good results compared to other LM and HKG methods.</sample>

    <sample id="327">The paper presents a novel vision-language (VL) modal architecture called ManagerTower, which aims to improve the performance of VL models by adaptively aggregating insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels. The authors propose that traditional two-tower architectures suffer from limitations in exploiting unimodal semantic knowledge and have limited scalability. To address these issues, ManagerTower introduces managers in each cross-modal layer to gather and combine insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels. The authors use RoBERTa and CLIP-ViT base as unimodal encoders and show that ManagerTower achieves superior performances on various downstream tasks with only four million images for visual language pre-training. The paper also provides visualizations of the average aggregation weight of textual or visual managers in each cross-modal layer over all samples in VQAv2 dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive managers in exploiting different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge.</sample>

    <sample id="329">The paper presents a method for generating structured pseudo-labels for noise-resistant zero-shot video sentence localization. The authors propose a three-step process: (1) generate more complex free-form pseudo-queries using a pre-trained image caption model; (2) measure the relevance between individual frames and pseudo-queries to generate pseudo-events that guarantee high relevance within events and low relevance outside events; and (3) reduce the weight of noisy samples and create noisy labels to reduce the influence of label noise. The authors use two datasets, ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA, to evaluate their method and show that it outperforms existing methods on most metrics. They also propose strategies for reducing the influence of label noise in the training process, such as estimating label noise based on model confidence and IoU, and using both strategies in their model training.</sample>

    <sample id="333">Wenhao from Nanjing University introduces their work on neural machine translation, specifically focusing on the issue of non-smooth representation spaces in NMT models. They propose a solution called kNN-MT, which smooths predictions by querying nearest neighbors in the representation space. However, this approach has drawbacks such as time-consuming neighbor retrieval and difficulty updating representations. To address these issues, they introduce INK, which injects kNN knowledge into the MT model. INK's training loop involves extracting kNN knowledge to guide an adapter to adjust representations, and then refreshing the datastore asynchronously. Experiments show that INK outperforms state-of-the-art kNN-MT systems and achieves better translation performance with less memory space and faster inference speed.</sample>

    <sample id="337">The English content presents a research paper titled "Graph-based Relation Mining for Context-free Out-of-vocabulary Word Embedding Learning." The paper addresses the challenge of representing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in embedding-based models. It introduces a Word Relationship Graph that leverages word formation and association to infer the meaning of OOV words. The graph is structured into two levels: the first level retains complete wordpiece information, while the second level samples a fixed number of nodes for training to mitigate noise. A self-attention network assigns attributes to OOV nodes based on their characters. Two levels of Graph Attention Network are used to process the graph, with a readout block layer summarizing the word formation. Contrastive learning is applied in the loss function using NT-XENT positive samples from the graph. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over baselines in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks. The model can benefit both static and contextual models in downstream tasks. The paper also discusses the potential application of the model to other languages, noting that agglutinative languages are well-suited, while fusional languages present more challenges.</sample>
    <sample id="338">Bingsheng's presentation introduces a collaborative research paper titled "Are Human Explanations Always Helpful? Towards Objective Evaluation of Human Natural Language Explanations." The paper, co-authored by researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research, aims to address the subjective nature of human-annotated explanations in machine learning models. The presentation covers the motivation behind the research, related works, and contributions divided into three sections: unified structure, preliminary experiments, and evaluation.

The research highlights the challenges in evaluating the quality of human explanations, as they can be task-dependent and subjective. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE focus on word similarity, while the simulatability score measures the change in baseline performance when explanations are presented or absent. However, these metrics do not consider task differences or the utility of explanations during fine-tuning and inference stages.

The paper proposes a novel evaluation metric called TREU (Task-Relevant Explanation Utility), which extends the simulatability score by assessing the helpfulness of explanations at fine-tuning. The authors evaluate human explanations across five large-scale datasets using both their TREU metric and the simulatability score on two models, T5 and BART. The results show that the TREU metric better reflects the intuition that human-annotated explanations can still benefit model predictions, even if considered low quality by humans.

The presentation concludes by emphasizing the importance of high-quality human collaboration in annotation jobs and recommends that researchers perform similar quality checks in the future. For more detailed findings, the audience is directed to refer to the paper.</sample>

    <sample id="340">Kuan-Hao Huang from UCLA presents their work on "ParaAMR: A Large-Scale Syntactically Diverse Paraphrase Dataset by AMR Back-Translation," a collaborative effort with Varun, I-Hung, Anoop, Kai-Wei, and Aram. The presentation highlights the importance of paraphrase generation in NLP for applications like question answering, chatbots, and improving robustness. Existing datasets like MRPC, PAN, and Quora offer high quality but are limited in scale, while automatically generated datasets through back-translation lack syntactic diversity.

The proposed ParaAMR dataset aims to address these limitations by leveraging Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR) graphs. AMR graphs capture the abstract meaning of sentences, allowing for syntactically diverse paraphrases through AMR back-translation. The dataset includes around 15 million source sentences, each with approximately 6.9 paraphrases, demonstrating higher syntactic diversity compared to other back-translation datasets.

Quantitative analysis shows that ParaAMR maintains good semantic similarity while achieving higher syntactic diversity scores. The dataset benefits various NLP applications, including learning sentence embeddings, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and few-shot learning data augmentation. The ParaAMR dataset is available for further use and research.</sample>

    <sample id="342">The presentation introduces a paper titled "LiveChat: A Large-Scale Personalized Dialogue Dataset Automatically Constructed from Live Streaming" by Gao Jingsheng and colleagues. The paper addresses the challenge of constructing large-scale video-sourced dialogue datasets, which are closer to real spoken conversations. The existing large-scale pre-trained dialogue datasets are mostly text-sourced, and there is a need for a dataset that can capture the reply-to relationships among speakers.

The paper proposes a unique automatic dialogue-constructing method to address the challenges of constructing a large-scale dialogue dataset. The method involves extracting audio from videos, transcribing it into utterances through ASR, collecting audience comments, and constructing dialogues using a reply-to-whom matching method. The persona information for personalized dialogue generation is also collected.

The paper conducts experiments on two benchmark tasks: response modeling and addressee recognition. The results show that the extracted persona and longer average sessions are beneficial to the final result. The paper also investigates the performance of pre-trained dialogue models on the LiveChat dataset and performs a series of experiments of in-context learning on different shots to study the influence of demonstrations.

In conclusion, the paper proposes LiveChat, a Chinese video-sourced and personalized dialogue dataset. The experiments show that the selected persona profiles and the average sessions per persona are advantageous in learning the speaker's personalized response. The comparisons between BART and other LLMs have unveiled the distinctiveness of our LiveChat. In the future, the researchers will pay more attention to the efficient transfer learning of LLMs for LiveChat.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree-based methods include the need to obtain trees, which can be complicated and computationally expensive. This often involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms, for example, to handle variable symbols. Obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar-induction procedures.</sample>
    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a neural sequence-to-sequence model that can handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases without relying on trees. The model predicts the output from the input in two steps: first, it tags each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output, and then it uses another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order. The permutation model is flexible and expressive, but finding the highest-scoring permutation is NP-hard. To address this challenge, the authors approximate the problem with a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation that allows them to backpropagate through the solution and learn linguistically plausible permutations. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other treeless models on generalization to deeper recursion. However, some other kinds of structural generalization remain challenging. The paper addresses technical challenges such as inducing alignment as part of training and finding the highest-scoring permutation.</sample>

    <sample id="348">This paper, titled "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models," explores the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs). The authors address limitations of existing measures, such as reliance on hand-constructed data sets and failure to account for intersectionality. They propose a method using instruction-tuned LLMs to generate personas based on prompts like "Imagine you are an Asian woman. Describe yourself." This approach allows for generalizability across demographics and contexts.

The method consists of two parts: generating personas and identifying marked words. Marked words are those that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, drawing upon sociolinguistic concepts of markedness. The authors compare generated personas with human-written responses and analyze word distributions using the Fightin' Words method. Results show that generated personas contain more stereotypes than human-written ones, but also reveal harmful patterns through essentializing narratives.

The study concludes with three recommendations for model owners: addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, using an intersectional lens to study biases, and increasing transparency about bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The presentation discusses the evaluation of NLP models using leaderboard-based methods and their comparison with human performance. The authors argue that these methods are not reliable due to several issues, such as differences in test sets, errors in ground-truth answers, and varying pay rates for human annotators. They highlight the need for more scientifically meaningful benchmarks and provide recommendations to avoid repeating the same mistakes. The presentation also analyzes two popular benchmarks, SuperGLUE and SQuAD, and discovers sources of error that make comparisons between humans and systems unfair. The authors conclude that claims about superhuman performance in NLP are not yet grounded and urge researchers to construct more reliable benchmarks.</sample>
    <sample id="351">In this presentation, Shuheng introduces a study on the generalization of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models developed using CoNLL-2003. The research explores whether these models can effectively generalize to modern data and identifies key factors for good generalization. The study involves fine-tuning over 20 models on CoNLL-2003 and evaluating them on both CoNLL-03 test sets and a newly created CoNLL++ dataset from Reuters News 2020.

The results indicate that three main ingredients contribute to better generalization: model architecture, model size, and the number of fine-tuning examples. Transformer models are found to generalize better, larger models perform better, and more fine-tuning examples improve performance. The study also examines two hypotheses for performance drops: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. Adaptive overfitting is ruled out as the primary cause, while temporal drift is confirmed as the main reason for performance degradation due to the increasing temporal gap between training and testing data.

The conclusion emphasizes the need for better model architectures, larger model sizes, and more fine-tuning examples for improved generalization. Despite some performance drops, the study confirms that CoNLL-2003 taggers still work well in 2023, highlighting the importance of ongoing research to enhance model generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" by Haau-Sing Li, Mohsen Mesgar, André F. T. Martins, and Iryna Gurevych addresses the challenge of input underspecification in code generation and program synthesis. The authors propose a method to create CodeClarQA, a synthetic dataset with clarifications on key operations, and a pipeline of code generation by asking clarification questions. They identify key operations and corresponding documentation from the code, represent them in latent space using their schemata, and compute similarity scores of all schema element pairs between an NLD and the operation documentation. If all element pairs for the similarity score is lower than threshold T, the key operation is missing; otherwise, it is aligned. They also hire annotators to annotate the validation set and the test set. They adopt templates to create CQAs for missing key operations, which are yes-or-no questions or multiple-choice questions. They use heuristics to extract key operations based on the code knowledge graph generated by Graph4Code. They have two hypotheses: that first, their task is more challenging than existing CQ ranking tasks, which is supported by CQ ranking results. And they also have the hypothesis that clarifications help code generation, which is supported by the code generation results. They test their pipeline and see that model performances on all evaluation metrics, including with more high-ranked CQs being answered and included, increases. However, there's an opposite trend of unanswered clarifications, and at the same time, their pipeline is still underperforming the model-only trainer NLDs and code, which is expected as they fine-tune the models on all CQAs and CQ ranking task is a challenge. They also do some analysis and seem that clarified key operations are the reason for better generated code.</sample>

    <sample id="361">Armineh Nourbakhsh is a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute and a research director at JP Morgan AI Research. She presents her work on "CounterComp," which aims to enhance compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning in question answering tasks using counterfactual scenarios. The challenge with current state-of-the-art neural models is that they memorize spurious patterns, leading to poor performance on tasks involving multiple arithmetic operations. CounterComp addresses this by identifying interchangeable components in questions and creating positive and negative examples from the training set. These examples are used to add an auxiliary metric learning loss to the training procedure, adjusting the margin based on the extent of change in the questions. This approach improves performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples, enhancing the model's ability to generalize. CounterComp also helps the model focus on more meaningful tokens during training, relating to operational terms in the output.
