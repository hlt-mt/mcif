    <sample id="2">The paper presents a novel pre-trained model, LayoutMask, for Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) tasks. It addresses the reading order issues in existing document pre-training models by using local 1D position instead of global 1D position. LayoutMask enhances text layout interactions and layout representations learned during pre-training by jointly using 1D position, 2D position, and semantic information. The paper proposes two novel masking strategies: Whole Word Masking and Layout-Aware Masking, which promote text-layout interactions and cross-segment orders. A new pre-training objective, Masked Position Modeling, is also introduced to recover randomly masked 2D positions during pre-training. The experiments compare the performance of LayoutMask using different layout information, showing that Local-1D outperforms Global-1D on both FUNSD and SROIE datasets.</sample>

    <sample id="6">The paper presents a work titled "Towards Unifying Multi-Lingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization" by Jiaan and his team. The authors propose a new summarization model called PISCES, which can generate summaries in any target language from a document in any source language. They unify previous multilingual and cross-lingual summarization into a more general setting named many-to-many summarization. The authors conduct preliminary studies to analyze the differences among multilingual summarization, cross-lingual summarization, and many-to-many summarization. They find that many-to-many summarization can help the summarization model better transfer task knowledge across different languages than previous multilingual summarization and cross-lingual summarization. The authors also propose a pre-trained many-to-many summarization model named PISCES, which is trained through a carefully designed three-stage pre-training. The experimental results show that PISCES outperforms various baselines, including mBART-50 and mT5.</sample>
    <sample id="7">Yes, according to the paper presented by Shuheng, CoNLL-2003 taggers still work well in 2023. The study investigated the generalization of models developed for the Named Entity Recognition Task (NER) using the CoNLL-2003 dataset. By comparing the performance of these models on both the original CoNLL-2003 test sets and a new dataset (CoNLL++), collected from Reuters News in 2020, the researchers found that there is no significant drop in performance. They concluded that the main cause of performance drop is temporal drift, which occurs due to the increasing temporal gap between the training and testing data. To improve generalization, better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine-tuning examples are needed.</sample>
    <sample id="8">The novelty of the proposed human evaluation method, ABC-Eval, lies in its ability to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors.

    <sample id="9">The success of the existing weakly supervised approach heavily relies on clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="10">To improve the score, several advances can be made:

1. Enhancing the language model's understanding of context and background knowledge: By providing more detailed information about the entities in question, such as their descriptions or images, the language model can better understand the indirect referring expressions and make more accurate selections.

2. Improving the language model's ability to disambiguate similar entities: Developing models that can more effectively distinguish between entities with similar titles, descriptions, or attributes will lead to higher accuracy in selecting the correct entity based on an indirect reference.

3. Expanding the dataset: Increasing the size and diversity of the AltEntities Corpus by including more alternative questions and indirect referring expressions will help train more robust language models and improve their performance.

4. Incorporating additional data sources: Integrating more comprehensive and up-to-date information from various sources, such as social media, forums, or user-generated content, can provide the language model with a broader understanding of how users refer to entities in different contexts.

5. Developing domain-specific language models: Creating separate language models tailored to specific domains (e.g., music, books, or recipes) can lead to improved performance in understanding indirect referring expressions within those domains.

By addressing these areas, future work can contribute to significant improvements in the accuracy and effectiveness of conversational systems when resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection.</sample>
    <sample id="11">Jack Hessel, a research scientist at AI2, presented a study on humor understanding benchmarks using The New Yorker Caption Contest. The study evaluates large language models' ability to generate, explain, and understand jokes through three tasks: matching, quality ranking, and explanation generation. The results show that while models like CLIP fine-tuned on the corpus achieve around 62% accuracy in matching (compared to a 20% random-guessing baseline), they still lag behind humans who score around 94%. Even when conditioned with human-authored descriptions, language models like GPT-4 still perform significantly worse than humans in matching and quality ranking tasks. In the explanation generation task, human evaluations prefer human explanations over those generated by five-shot GPT-4 explanations in more than two-thirds of cases. The study highlights the need for further research in humor understanding and invites others to use the provided dataset and leaderboard.</sample>

The research demonstrates that SWEET closes the gap between Early Exit and Multi Model but can negatively affect later classifiers. The study also presents the first fair comparison of Early Exit and Multi Model adaptive inference methods and suggests future research tailored to the Early Exit architecture.</sample>

    <sample id="17">The presented work by Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student at NUS, focuses on multimodal relation extraction in the context of social media data. The research addresses two main issues: internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation. To tackle these problems, the proposed method employs a Graph Information Bottleneck principle-guided feature refinement and considers multimodal topic information as supplementary semantic context.

The framework consists of five parts: representing text and image with corresponding visual and textual scene graphs, merging them into a unified cross-modal graph (CMG), screening initial CMG structures, enriching compressed CMG features with multimodal topic features, and integrating multimodal topic words through an attention operation.

Experiments conducted on the widely used MRE dataset show that leveraging visual features and incorporating multimodal topic information significantly improve performance compared to text-based methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate that both internal-information screening and external-information exploiting contribute to task performance, with internal screening being more important for high text-vision relevance inputs and external exploiting for lower relevance inputs.

Overall, the proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing models, highlighting the importance of simultaneous information subtraction and addition in multimodal relation extraction.</sample>
    <sample id="18">The example of the preference for shorter left conjuncts is "salt and pepper" instead of "pepper and salt." This preference occurs when the governor is on the left or absent, and it becomes more pronounced as the length difference between the two conjuncts increases.</sample>
    <sample id="19">In this presentation, Zhang Qin from Shenzhen University introduces their work on efficient open-domain question answering, which was accepted by ACL 2023. The main focus is on the two-stage model proposed by Danqi Chen in 2017, consisting of a retrieval stage using a question encoder and document encoder to retrieve evidence contexts from a preprocessed Wikipedia corpus, and a reader stage that understands the question and retrieves the evidence to reason out the answer. However, challenges include the large size of the Wikipedia corpus (26 million documents, 20 GB), the index file (65 GB) for searching, and the use of multiple language models with millions of parameters.

To address these challenges, the researchers propose core techniques such as approximate nearest neighbor search for faster evidence retrieval, skip reading strategies like adaptive computation to reduce context reading, document filtering before retrieval, embedding dimension completion, or product quantization to reduce index size, and selecting lightweight models or parameter sharing to reduce model size. They also compare existing open-domain question answering models based on data aspects, showing that retrieval and reader systems perform well-balanced among speed, memory, and performance, while retrieval-only systems are fast but create large indexes, and generator-only systems have no index but are always large models and achieve low performance.

The presentation concludes with insights on deploying open-domain question answering systems in low-power devices and considering more evaluation metrics. Future works include deploying systems in low-power devices and evaluating them with more metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="23">The paper by Dan Garrette et al. presents a study on the ability of text-image models to render visual text. The authors focus on the Imagen model, which uses a T5-XXL encoder to generate images from input text. They find that even with complex inputs, these models often fail to represent text accurately. The authors investigate the text encoders and discover that they struggle with spelling words correctly, especially for more frequent words. This is due to the way SentencePiece tokenization works, where more frequent words are represented by fewer subwords. To improve this, the authors propose concatenating an additional text representation from the ByT5-small model, which has full access to character-level information. This augmentation significantly improves the model's ability to spell words correctly and enhances image generation characteristics. However, the diffusion model may still introduce errors in the generated text. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of considering character-level information in text encoders to improve text rendering capabilities in text-image models.</sample>
    <sample id="24">The tendency for left conjuncts to be shorter was measured by extracting various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the Penn Treebank and observing that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, measured in syllables. This tendency grows with length difference, so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows, the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one.</sample>
    <sample id="25">The experiments were designed to measure the length of the conjuncts in coordination structures using different units such as characters, syllables, and words. The data was extracted from the enhanced version of the Penn Treebank. The researchers observed that when the governor is on the left or absent, the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words. However, when the governor is on the right, this effect disappears. This provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination and supports symmetric structures.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The paper introduces LLM-Blender, a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework for large language models. The framework is based on pairwise ranking and generative fusion. It consists of two stages: PairRanker and GenFuser. In the first stage, PairRanker compares all candidate models using a cross-attention module such as RoBERTa to determine which model is better for a given input. In the second stage, GenFuser selects the top K candidates ranked by PairRanker and uses them as input to a sequence-to-sequence model for generating the final output.

LLM-Blender is designed to address the issue that the optimal selection of models can vary across different input examples. The framework considers using more large language models for each input to select and generate better output than using any single model for all inputs. Experiments show that LLM-Blender outperforms individual models in terms of correlation metrics and achieves promising results in 68% and 76% of examples for Open Assistant and Vicuna, respectively. The paper also introduces a new dataset named MixInstruct for evaluating the performance of large language models.</sample>

    <sample id="34">The paper presents CREST, a joint framework for selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation. The framework combines two methods: selective rationalization, which provides explanations by highlighting tokens in a faithful way, and counterfactual generation, which is more aligned with human causal reasoning. CREST generates counterfactuals by masking the original input alongside prepending the gold label to it, then passing the masked inputs to an editor, which fills in the masked response with new tokens. The quality of the counterfactuals produced by CREST is evaluated using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. The results show that CREST counterfactuals are more valid and natural than those produced by MiCE and other automatic approaches. The paper also proposes an alternative way to perform rationalization with both factual and counterfactual examples, which achieves the top result on IMDB itself and performs on par with data augmentation using human counterfactuals on contrastive datasets. Overall, CREST produces plausible explanations that focus on the contrasting parts of the input, making it a valuable tool for improving downstream models.</sample>
    <sample id="36">This paper presents a method for improving multilingual machine translation by incorporating language-specific layers (LSLs) into the model architecture. The authors propose using one regular transformer layer per language, which allows the model to select and train the correct sublayer at inference time based on the language being translated. This approach keeps the inference cost constant while increasing the capacity per language.

The authors explore different placement strategies for LSLs and find that placing them in the encoder yields better results than in the decoder. They use a method of training with all components and then selecting the best placement based on the weights of the shared, source, and target components. The results show significant improvements over baseline models and language adapters, particularly for low-resource languages. The paper also includes ablation studies, different metrics, and setups for shared or separate decoders.</sample>

    <sample id="41">The paper presents a Persona Commonsense Knowledge Graph (PeaCoK) that represents real-world personas and their attributes at scale. PeaCoK contains about 3,800 personas and 40,000 distinctive attributes, forming about 100,000 personal inferences or facts. The graph is built in three steps: selecting personas from existing commonsense graphs, inducing attributes of personas from both commonsense knowledge graphs and large-scale pre-trained language models, and crowdsourcing the annotations of PeaCoK relations using a joint human-AI majority voting scheme.

PeaCoK can help language models learn and generalize persona knowledge. A BART-based common knowledge generator trained on PeaCoK achieves overall better automatic evaluation results on various natural language generation metrics compared to large-scale pre-trained language models. PeaCoK's persona-centric commonsense knowledge yields a more positive impact compared to general social commonsense knowledge in downstream narrative modeling tasks, such as persona-grounded dialogue generation. The winning rates of PeaCoK augmented models increase as the number of shared common attributes between two speakers becomes larger.</sample>

    <sample id="54">The paper "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare-Class Challenge" by Vasudha and colleagues presents a method to detect cognitive dissonance in language using transfer learning and active learning. The authors define cognitive dissonance as the inconsistency between beliefs or actions, which is a common phenomenon in daily decision making. They highlight the importance of studying dissonance expressed in language to understand disagreement, track trends, and mental health issues. To address the rare occurrence of dissonance, they conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations using a dissonance-first approach. They experimented with combinations of transfer learning and active learning to collect more dissonant samples while reducing annotation costs. They found that transferring weights from closely related tasks, such as topic-independent dissonance stance classification and expansion/comparison classes, improved zero-shot performance. They also developed a Probability-of-Rare-Class strategy to select examples likely to be misclassified by the current model. The proposed PRC strategy outperformed other state-of-the-art AL strategies, achieving the best performance on the task so far. The authors conclude that PRC is a simple AL strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting AL with appropriately designed transfer learning task, and iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain.</sample>

    <sample id="62">This paper presents a systematic study of knowledge distillation for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, aiming to compress large language models while preserving performance. The authors explore various NLG tasks such as summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, and style transfer using realistic setups with medium-resource labeled data, large amounts of unlabeled data, and medium-sized off-the-shelf models. They compare different approaches for knowledge selection, including word-level and sequence-level distillation, and propose a novel joint-teaching technique to address student exposure bias and teach the model to correct its own mistakes. The study highlights the importance of unlabeled data in boosting distillation and generating diverse pseudo-targets to expose the student to more diverse knowledge. The research provides insights into the practical application of knowledge distillation in NLG tasks, offering a recipe for effective model compression while maintaining performance.</sample>

The authors discuss two primary categories of mathematical reasoning: visual contexts, such as geometric diagrams, and tabular contexts, like tables and figures. They highlight the importance of automated theorem proving and the use of neural network architectures, including sequence-to-sequence models and pre-trained language models (LLMs), in solving math word problems. The paper also addresses the limitations of LLMs in performing precise mathematical reasoning and proposes solutions such as self-consistency and program-aided LMMs. Additionally, the authors mention the challenges of generalization and robustness failures in learning models on reasoning tasks, particularly with large numbers and inconsistencies in mathematical reasoning. The paper concludes by discussing the need for more research in low-resource settings and the development of mathematical reasoning benchmarks for various domains.</sample>
    <sample id="67">This work identifies the main factors that contribute to interference or synergy in multilingual translation models. Severe interference occurs when the model is very small compared to the data size, and tuning the sampling temperature is key for strong performance. For the simpler bilingual case, there are model and data size scaling laws to successfully predict a loss. But the multilingual case is more tricky, with other factors that can potentially impact performance such as the data size of other languages, language similarity, and the total number of languages. The authors find that both language similarity and the number of languages do not have a large impact on interference levels. They experiment across the model and focus data sizes when varying the total number of examples of interfering languages, and see that severe interference occurs only for the smallest models and that the problem actually goes away with this in the amount of scale. The simplest solution is temperature sampling, when T greater than 1 allows to sample more training examples from lower-resource languages. Based on these results, the lesson here is that tuned temperature is key for strong performance.</sample>
    <sample id="68">During pretraining, models receive a vast amount of linguistic context from a diverse range of texts.

    <sample id="71">The AltEntities Corpus is a dataset created by Javad Hosseini and his team to address the challenge of resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in conversational systems. The dataset consists of 6,000 alternative questions across three domains: music, books, and recipes. Each question has multiple indirect referring expressions provided by annotators. The dataset collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion setup, where Bob sets the dialogue context and Alice asks an alternative question, followed by Bob's indirect reference. Annotators are shown background knowledge about the entities and are asked to pick one and describe it using indirect referring expressions. The results with T5 XL model show high accuracy when the language model has access to the same background knowledge as the annotators (92-95%), but lower accuracy when only partially overlapping or only entity names are available (82-87% and 60%, respectively). The models are also domain-generalizable.</sample>
    <sample id="72">There is a need to develop new methods for measuring media biases because current methods are not effective in detecting biases in language models. The existing methods mainly focus on evaluating the performance of NLP models on downstream tasks, but they do not take into account the political leaning of the language models themselves. By developing new methods that can accurately measure the political biases of language models, we can better understand how these biases may impact the fairness and accuracy of NLP applications. This would allow us to take steps to mitigate any potential negative effects and ensure that NLP models are fair, unbiased, and reliable.</sample>

    <sample id="74">The paper "Dense-ATOMIC: Towards Densely-connected ATOMIC with High Knowledge Coverage and Massive Multi-hop Paths" by Xiangqing and co-authors introduces a new approach to enhancing the existing ATOMIC commonsense knowledge base. ATOMIC, while high-quality, suffers from limited multi-hop paths due to missing B-to-B, A-to-B, and A-to-A links. The authors propose Dense-ATOMIC, which completes these missing links through three main steps: normalizing tail events, training a relation prediction model (Rel-CSKGC), and constructing Dense-ATOMIC.

Rel-CSKGC predicts relations between head and tail events using RoBERTa for semantic encoding and MaxPooling for link prediction, addressing the limitations of sparse graph structures and insufficient semantic information. The Intra- and Inter-Cluster Completion Strategy further optimizes the process by inferring missing links within and between clusters. Dense-ATOMIC results in higher knowledge coverage and more diverse multi-hop paths, as demonstrated through comparisons with relation prediction methods and translation-based approaches. The paper also evaluates the performance of COMET on DenseATOMIC, showing improved results.</sample>
    <sample id="75">The presented work, Jointprop, is a joint semi-supervised learning framework for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). It aims to address the limitations of supervised learning by utilizing a small amount of labeled data to obtain powerful models at a lower cost. The framework models NER and RE tasks by propagating labels over heterogeneous graphs, considering inter- and intra-connections among both labeled and unlabeled data. The method consists of four parts: span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. Experiments on four datasets show that Jointprop benefits from codependency between NER and RE in joint datasets and demonstrates significant improvement over all baselines for single-task datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="76">The political bias propagation pipeline involves the following steps:

1. Pretraining data: Large-scale web crawl data, which includes diverse perspectives and political opinions, is used to train language models.
2. Language models with varying political leanings: The pretraining data can lead to language models having different political leanings, such as GPT-4 being the most liberal model among them.
3. Controlled experiments: By further pretraining language models on partisan corpora separated into news and social media, the political biases of language models can be investigated and shifted accordingly.
4. Evaluation on downstream tasks: Language models with different political leanings are evaluated on NLP applications like hate speech detection and fake news detection, revealing potential fairness issues in their performance based on the social categories of the news media.

This pipeline highlights the potential for political biases to propagate from pretraining data to language models and ultimately affect the fairness of downstream NLP applications.</sample>

The team proposes three new Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. They provide strong baseline models for each task and analyze the factual consistency of summarization models using the DeFacto dataset, which contains human demonstrations and feedback. Annotators label whether the summary is factually consistent and provide human-corrected summaries, instructions, explanations, and evidence. The dataset includes around 2.5K data points, with 70% containing factual errors. The video also shows data distribution of annotated editing instructions and their relation with different error types.

    <sample id="82">This video introduces a new framework for unsupervised automated essay scoring (AES) called ULRA, which aims to improve the performance of AES models by aggregating multiple heuristic quality signals as supervision. The proposed framework consists of two main modules: a heuristic essay ranking module (HER alpha-shot) and a deep pairwise rank aggregation module (DPRA). HER alpha-shot generates partial-order pairs by ranking essays according to different heuristic quality signals, while DPRA trains a neural AES model by aggregating these partial-order pairs into a unified supervision. A learnable confidence weight is designed for each signal to measure its importance. In the model inference stage, a scoring strategy is proposed to transform the predicted scores into the range of the predefined score set through a minimum-maximum transformation. Experiments on both transductive and inductive settings demonstrate that ULRA outperforms all unsupervised baselines with a large improvement.</sample>

    <sample id="84">The paper "PAD-Net: An Efficient Framework for Dynamic Networks" by Shwai He presents a new approach to dynamic networks, which can change their architecture or parameters based on the input. The author argues that fully dynamic networks can be inefficient due to excessive use of parameters, and proposes a framework called PAD-Net that partitions parameters into dynamic and static modes. The goal is to make redundant dynamic parameters static, which can improve performance while reducing the number of parameters and computation. The author also conducts ablation studies to find optimal dynamic ratios for different components of the network, and compares the performance of PAD-Net with network pruning. The results show that PAD-Net achieves better performance than fully dynamic networks while maintaining fewer parameters and less computation. The paper suggests future work in extending the method to other mainstream networks, hardware-friendly structured manners, and introducing more modes such as the combination among zero elements, static parameters, and dynamic parameters.</sample>

    <sample id="87">The work uses existing PLMs (Pre-trained Language Models) to build a new one by comparing different models with multiple pre-training settings and data sources. Specifically, the authors train and compare four from-scratch models: DrBERT, ChuBERT, and two models trained on continual pre-training using CamemBERT and PubMedBERT. They evaluate these models on public and private downstream tasks such as named entity recognition, classification, part-of-speech tagging, and question answering, and compare their performance with six baseline models. The results show that the models perform best on tasks with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained, but data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile. Overall, the experiment highlights that using more data and specialized data is better, but it doesn't scale well.</sample>

    <sample id="89">The speaker shows how the model leverages knowledge learned through the attention mechanism using the example sentence "I'm going to talk about...". In this case, the model predicts the translation in German and looks at the cross-attention weights. The first two words point to the earliest received speech frames, while the last word points to the last received speech frames (lambda speech frames). Since the sum of the cross-attention is below a certain threshold alpha for the last word, it will not be emitted and the model will wait for another speech chunk.</sample>
    <sample id="90">The paper "Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?" by Haneul Yoo and colleagues explores the feasibility of using language learners as annotators in NLP tasks. The authors conducted a proof-of-concept study, targeting three languages (English, Korean, and Indonesian) and four common NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, NLI, NER, and MRC). They recruited native speakers and language learners, categorizing them into three proficiency levels (basic, intermediate, and advanced), and provided additional resources to help them understand annotation samples.

The study found that language learner annotations were nearly accurate, especially for simpler tasks and easy-to-medium level questions. Aggregating labels from multiple language learners by majority voting brought their performance on par with native speakers. Moreover, training simulations showed that language models trained on learners' less accurate labels achieved about 95% of ground truth performance and sometimes outperformed those trained with native speakers' labels.

The paper suggests a novel approach to data construction in low- to mid-resource languages by recruiting language learners as annotators, broadening NLP research possibilities for many languages and overcoming geographic and technological barriers.</sample>

    <sample id="94">The paper proposes a backdoor-based watermark method called Embedding Marker to protect the copyright of embedding as services. The method involves watermark injection and copyright verification. In watermark injection, a target embedding is defined, and when a user sends a sentence to the provider service, the provider counts the number of triggers in the sentence and provides an embedding that is a weight summation of the target embedding and the original embedding. In copyright verification, the provider requests embeddings from the stealer's service with a backdoor and benign data set, and the similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding is computed using cosine and L2 similarity. The results show that Embedding Marker can have great detection performance while keeping great utility for downstream tasks. The covertness of the provided embedding is validated by visualizing the embedding of sentences on four datasets using PCA.</sample>

    <sample id="100">The presented research introduces PromptRank, a data-efficient multi-hop question answering (QA) system that leverages an unsupervised retrieval method combined with a few-shot language model-based reranker. Unlike traditional systems requiring thousands of examples for good performance, PromptRank achieves comparable results with as few as 128 examples. The approach involves two main steps: retrieving candidate chains using TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, followed by reranking these candidates using a few-shot language model. The scoring function employed is the likelihood of the question given the chain according to a language model, which is used to rank the chains effectively. The research explores techniques such as instruction search, instruction sampling, and temperature scaling to optimize the process. Evaluation on the HotpotQA dataset demonstrates that PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and performs comparably to state-of-the-art multi-hop dense retrievers. Additionally, when integrated with a downstream QA reader model like ELECTRA-Large, PromptRank exhibits strong multi-hop QA performance, only slightly underperforming MDR by around four exact match points. The study highlights the potential of language models in few-shot ranking for multi-hop QA tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="106">The paper titled QUEST, a collaboration with researchers from Google DeepMind, addresses the challenge of handling selective information needs in queries. It introduces a retrieval dataset containing over 3,000 entity-seeking queries with implicit set constraints. The dataset includes verified answer entities and their associated documents marked with attributable spans for different query constraints.

QUEST is constructed by relying on Wikipedia category names from four domains: films, books, plants, and animals. Queries are generated by performing set operations over these atomic categories. Human annotators paraphrase and validate the queries, ensuring fluency and naturalness. They also verify the relevance of entities in the answer set and mark evidence in the document as its attribution.

To evaluate systems on the QUEST dataset, researchers consider sparse and dense retrievers, as well as a T5-based reranker that takes in the top 100 candidates from the retriever. The results show a large room for improvement in retriever performance based on the recall of the complete answer set, indicated by MRecall@100 scores. End-to-end system performance in terms of F1 scores is fairly low, highlighting the difficulty of systems in handling such queries. Queries with set intersection and set difference are particularly challenging and have the lowest F1 scores.</sample>

    <sample id="108">The paper presents a study on the robustness of language models to context in acceptability judgments. The authors revisit the minimal pair paradigm, which evaluates language models based on their ability to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable sentences. They argue that the current pipeline does not allow for evaluation of models' acceptability across longer sentences, which is crucial given the increasing context windows of large language models.

To address this, the authors simulate longer sequences by recreating sentences from the same or different datasets, including Wikipedia. They find that MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context length when using Wikipedia sentences, but significantly affected when using sentences from the same dataset as the evaluation. This suggests that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences, which may not be fully captured by the current evaluation method.

Overall, the paper highlights the need for more comprehensive evaluation methods that can assess language models' abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The paper presents a method for creating a large dataset of natural language instructions and their corresponding inputs and outputs, without any human labor. The method involves prompting a pre-trained language model to generate instructions and their corresponding inputs and outputs, and then generating additional paraphrases of each instruction. The resulting dataset contains 64,000 examples, and if we consider the instruction paraphrases, we have about 240,000 examples. The generated examples are analyzed for creativity, diversity, and correctness, and the results show that more than 50% of the generated examples are indeed correct, and even incorrect examples often contain valuable information for instruction tuning. The utility of the generated data is measured by fine-tuning an 11 billion-parameter T5 model on Unnatural Instructions, which outperforms both T0++ and Tk-instruct across several benchmarks. The paper highlights the ability of language models to produce creative and diverse data, which is difficult to obtain with crowd workers who usually collapse into predictable heuristics and form annotation artifacts. At the same time, language models are faster and cheaper than human annotations.</sample>

    <sample id="114">The paper "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention" by researchers from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore addresses the issue of heavy parameters in large language models. The authors propose a grouped head attention method that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to compress multi-head attention, aiming to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining performance.

The method consists of two stages: group-constrained training and Voting-to-Stay algorithm. In the first stage, heads are divided into groups based on their similarity or separation. The second stage involves pruning redundant heads within each group using a voting system. This approach allows for significant parameter compression, with the potential to reduce parameters by up to 90%.

The authors evaluate their method on three tasks: machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization. They compare their models, GHT and GHT-PS, with state-of-the-art baselines, showing improvements in performance and efficiency. For instance, GHT-PS achieves 32.1% parameter compression with comparable performance on the machine translation task.

The paper also discusses the potential for task-specific automatic pruning, supported by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which suggests that networks contain subnetworks that can match the performance of the original network. This confidence is used to justify the pruning of redundant parameters in real-world applications, where only a few tasks are typically needed.

Overall, the proposed method offers a promising direction for reducing the size and computational requirements of large language models without sacrificing performance, making them more deployable and efficient in real-world scenarios.</sample>

    <sample id="118">This paper presents a new pre-training technique for code-switched Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The authors define code-switching as the use of multiple languages in a single sentence, which is common in linguistically diverse communities like India. They argue that existing multilingual pre-trained models like mBERT and XLM-R do not perform well on code-switched tasks such as question answering and sentiment analysis.

To address this issue, the authors propose SwitchMLM, a novel MLM (Masked Language Modeling) technique tuned to handle code-switch information. They define a switch-point as a group of two tokens that indicate a language transition. In SwitchMLM, only these switch-points are maskable, unlike standard MLM where all words are maskable with uniform probability. However, this approach requires access to LID (Language Identification) tagged datasets or taggers, which may not always be available. To overcome this limitation, they propose FrequencyMLM, a surrogate method that assigns LID tags based on the negative log likelihood of the word in each monolingual corpus.

The authors also suggest architectural modifications, including residual connections from intermediate layers to the final layer, to increase the amount of switch-point information encoded in the final representation. They impose an auxiliary LID-based loss on the intermediate layer to encourage it to learn more LID information.

The results show that the combined method of SwitchMLM, ResBERT (residual connections), and an auxiliary loss performs the best on sentiment analysis tasks across all language pairs. Probing experiments using linear and conditional probes verify that the proposed methods increase the amount of switch-point information in intermediate and final layers. These findings support the hypothesis that the proposed methods enhance the model's ability to handle code-switch information.</sample>

    <sample id="123">The research presented by Ying and Zhiyang focuses on improving multi-modal zero-shot learning through instruction tuning. The study explores the effectiveness of instruction tuning in enhancing the performance of a multi-modal pre-trained model, OFA, on unseen tasks. The researchers address the lack of multi-modal instruction datasets by creating MultiInstruct, a benchmark dataset comprising 62 diverse multi-modal tasks from 10 broad categories, each with five expert-written instructions.

Using OFA as the base model, the researchers train the model on 53 tasks from nine groups, sampling 10,000 instances per task. They test the model on the remaining tasks, including a common sense reasoning group and additional tasks from VQ and Miscellaneous groups. The evaluation metrics include accuracy for classification tasks, Rouge-L for generation tasks, and sensitivity to measure consistency in output across different instruction variations.

The results show that instruction tuning significantly improves OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks, with better performance and lower sensitivity as more tasks are used for training. Transfer learning from natural instruction datasets also enhances the model's sensitivity and performance. The researchers propose a new metric called sensitivity and plan to release an expanded dataset with around 150 additional vision-language tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="124">The presentation by Tan Qingyu from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba focuses on the development of a comprehensive approach to temporal reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The work identifies three levels of temporal reasoning: time-to-time, time-to-event, and event-to-event. The authors address the limitations of prior studies that primarily focused on level 2 (time-to-event) reasoning. They introduce the TempReason dataset, which covers all three levels and spans long temporal periods, including year, month, and event-specific queries. The dataset is evaluated using three QA settings: Closed Book, Open Book, and Reasoning QA.

The authors propose a training strategy comprising two components: Temporal Span Extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning. The final model, TempT5, shows significant improvements over other instruction-tuned LLMs, particularly in Open Book and Reasoning QA settings. Despite these advancements, the model still exhibits performance fluctuations across different time periods, indicating ongoing challenges in temporal reasoning.

Overall, the presentation highlights the importance of addressing temporal reasoning biases in LLMs and introduces a new benchmark and training paradigm to enhance their temporal reasoning capabilities.</sample>

    <sample id="127">The paper "Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers" by Namgyu Ho, Laura Schmid, and Se-Young Yun proposes a novel technique to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models to much smaller models. The authors argue that while chain-of-thought reasoning has been successful in enabling large language models to solve complex tasks, it is limited by the need for huge memory and computation resources. To address this issue, they propose using large models as reasoning teachers to fine-tune smaller models. They introduce a technique called Diverse Reasoning, which generates multiple reasoning samples from the teacher model using stochastic temperature sampling. This allows the student model to learn from diverse solutions and perform complex reasoning tasks effectively. The paper demonstrates that their method can achieve notable performance on 12 tasks, even with small models of only 0.3 billion parameters. The authors also discuss the scalability of their method and the trade-offs between development costs, inference costs, and the quality of inference. Overall, the paper provides a highly scalable and effective approach for transferring reasoning abilities from large language models to smaller models, which can be applied in various real-world scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="128">The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources is a collaborative work between McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research. The study aims to evaluate the ability of natural language understanding models to integrate knowledge from different sources, including pretraining and inference time. The authors propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration, specifically focusing on coreference resolution tasks that require both entity-specific and background knowledge.

The study evaluates three settings of KITMUS: Background-Pretrain, Background-Both, and Background-Inference. In the Background-Pretrain setting, background knowledge is assumed to be available at pretraining time. In the Background-Both setting, both background and entity-specific knowledge are available during inference time. In the Background-Inference setting, only entity-specific knowledge is available at inference time.

The results show that without task-specific training on KITMUS, most models perform poorly. However, when trained on KITMUS, both C2F and BERT4Coref models perform significantly better than random choice. Additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best-performing models have difficulties integrating backward knowledge provided only at inference time.

Overall, the study suggests that many coreference resolution models struggle to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training. However, with task-specific training, some models can successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>

    <sample id="135">ABC-Eval is a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI developed by the Emory NLP Lab led by Professor Jinho Choi at Emory University and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. This method aims to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself. The approach measures the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors, including ignoring their partner, saying something irrelevant, contradicting themselves or their partner, hallucinating incorrect facts, violating common sense knowledge, and failing to show empathy. The study found that ABC-Eval behavior labels are more reliable than labels collected by existing methods, and they are more predictive of overall conversation quality. The combination of all ABC-Eval metrics explains over 25% of conversation quality, while the combination of all turn-level Likert metrics explains far less of the quality. The study highlights the need for reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models, and hopes that ABC-Eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction.</sample>
    <sample id="136">The research presented by Jasivan and Nafise at the University of Sheffield focuses on improving numerical reasoning in language models. The existing benchmarks, which use accuracy scores like F1 measures, are insufficient for understanding the strengths and shortcomings of these models in mathematical abilities. To address this, they introduce FERMAT, a flexible evaluation set based on arithmetic types that tests number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency.

FERMAT includes math worded questions extracted from Illinois and CommonCore, with numbers represented in various formats (e.g., 5.0, large integers, small integers, decimals) to test the range and breadth of models. The study evaluates models' performance across different mathematical operations and training dependencies. They find that most models perform poorly in zero-shot evaluations, but fine-tuning with math teachers' templates improves performance across all aspects. The research highlights the importance of language and mathematical diversity in training data for better model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="137">This paper introduces Tell2Design, a dataset for language-guided floor plan generation. The dataset consists of 5,051 human-annotated and around 76,000 artificially generated language instructions for floor plans. The task is to generate 2D floor plan designs from natural language instructions that specify semantics, geometry, and topology. The authors propose a sequence-to-sequence model using a transformer-based encoder-decoder structure to generate floor plans from language instructions. The model is initialized by a pre-trained language model T5 for better language understanding abilities. The results show that the proposed method outperforms text-conditional image generation baselines by a large margin in terms of IoU scores. The paper highlights the challenges of this novel task, including stricter constraints, understanding the big picture of the entire floor plan, and dealing with ambiguous, incomplete, or misleading information in human instructions.</sample>

    <sample id="146">This paper presents a study on the omission problem in dialogue summarization. The authors analyze the percentage of summaries suffering from omission and find that about 70% of generated summaries have this issue, which is a serious problem in dialogue summarization. They propose the OLDS dataset to provide high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization, which is built upon five existing benchmarks covering five domains. To build a foundation for the omission detection task, they explore three frameworks as baselines, which have different input formats and structures, including pair-wise classification, sequence labeling, and pointer network. They use the Precision, Recall, and F1-score to evaluate their omission detection models. Furthermore, they calculate the percentage of gold emission words that are hit in the detected utterances to measure the word-level omission recall, denoted as WR score. The results show that the task is very challenging, which calls for more advanced detection models. Finally, they use a post-editing method for summary refinement, which concatenates the candidate summary with omission content as input, and the model outputs the refined summary in a sequence-to-sequence manner. From the figure, they find that the performance is largely boosted when the omission is provided. It indicates that the omission detection is a valuable task, and the refinement based on the detected omission is a promising direction for quality improvement in dialogue summarization.</sample>

The dataset contains 7.7K questions split between the Train, Dev, and Test sets, with 30% of questions being unanswerable. Out of the remaining, 40% have multi-span answers and 48% have multi-speaker answers. Questions are longer, open-ended, and actively seek discussions from others. We employ a variety of methods in our paper, including context-retrieval, single-span models, multi-span variants, and data augmentation. Our results show that there is over a 25 F1 point gap between fine-tuned models and human performance, and nearly a 50 F1 point gap between zero-shot performance and human performance. Error analysis shows that models struggle to identify rhetorical questions, especially in the zero-shot setting, and predictions of single-span models contain more irrelevant sentences than their multi-span counterparts. MeetingQA is an interesting dataset based on open-ended and discussion-seeking questions in real-life meeting scenarios, and the dataset is far from being solved as it is challenging for existing QA models in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.</sample>
    <sample id="152">In this presentation, Frederick Riemenschneider introduces new language models designed for classical philology. The project aims to create models that can handle both Ancient Greek and Latin texts, exploring different model architectures and multilingual capabilities. The team has pre-trained two monolingual models for Ancient Greek (GreBERTa and GreTa) and developed multilingual models (PhilBERTa and PhilTa) using data from the Internet Archive, Corpus Corporum, and related English texts.

The models have been benchmarked on tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and lemmatization, outperforming current state-of-the-art models. The encoder-decoder models show significant improvements in lemmatization performance. The team also analyzed the behavior of T5's encoder and investigated the implications of multilinguality in their models.

Overall, the project presents powerful language models for classical philology, capable of processing both Ancient Greek and Latin texts, and has introduced a high-quality pre-training dataset for Ancient Greek.</sample>
    <sample id="153">In this work, we study the ambiguities in prompts provided to text-to-image models and propose frameworks to mitigate such ambiguities as well as frameworks to evaluate whether the generated images are faithful to user intention. We curate a benchmark dataset that covers different types of ambiguities and provide these prompts to a prompt disambiguation framework that tries to gather external signals to disambiguate the prompt through either asking clarifying questions from the user or generating different possible visual setups. Once we have the prompts disambiguated, we input these disambiguated prompts into a text-to-image model, generate the images, and evaluate whether the generated images are faithful to user intention. We propose an automatic evaluation framework that uses a VQA model to evaluate whether the human's intention is satisfied in the image or not. Our findings show that there is disparity in resolving ambiguities for different ambiguity types, disambiguation using our framework has overall a positive effect in faithful generation, and our automatic evaluation framework is in agreement with human evaluation.</sample>

    <sample id="157">The research presented by Shen Gao and colleagues introduces a novel dialogue summarization method called Dialogue Summarization with Static-Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph (SDDS). This method addresses the challenges of existing dialogue summarization techniques that rely on pre-computed static graphs, which can be inaccurate and inflexible. SDDS incorporates both static and dynamic graph structures to better capture the semantic relationships between utterances in a dialogue context.

The SDDS model consists of four main components: an Utterance Encoder for vectorizing dialogue utterances, a Static-Dynamic Graph module for integrating multiple static graphs and capturing dynamic semantic relationships, and a Summary Generator using a pre-trained language model. The static graph is constructed using various heuristic methods such as discourse parsing, speaker interaction frequency, and utterance position, while the dynamic graph employs a multi-head attention model to learn relationships based on deep utterance representations.

By fusing the static and dynamic graph structures, SDDS generates a comprehensive summary that accurately captures the main ideas and interactions within a dialogue. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through detailed model structure and experimental results, making it a significant contribution to the field of text summarization.</sample>
    <sample id="158">Coreference resolution is the task of identifying mentions in a document that refer to the same entity and clustering them accordingly. Conventional methods for this task have quadratic complexity, while cache-based methods reduce it to linear level by using a fixed-size cache with eviction policies like LRU. However, in long documents, topic switches can cause high cache misses due to scattered mentions of entities. The proposed dual cache system addresses this issue by having a local cache with an LRU policy and a global cache with an LFU policy. The model classifies new mentions as either new entities or updates to existing ones, evaluates their frequency, and adds them to the appropriate cache. Evaluation on four public benchmarks shows that dual cache outperforms single cache methods and significantly reduces cache misses, especially in book-level documents. Despite some trade-offs between efficiency and performance, dual cache offers the highest performance-cost ratio.</sample>

    <sample id="165">The paper presents an unsupervised learning method called LiPoR (Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization) for abductive reasoning in a closed-world setting. The method treats explanations as latent variables and maximizes the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context by marginalizing other possible explanations. To prefer plausible explanations, the method uses a regularizer that enforces mutual exclusivity among explanations. The paper compares LiPoR to zero-shot models and previous best unsupervised approaches on AlphaNLI, achieving over 4 absolute points in accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="166">The paper presents a new framework for image retrieval from linguistically complex text using a neural divide-and-conquer reasoning approach. The proposed method, NDCR, decomposes complex propositions into simpler ones and uses visual-linguistic interaction to match these with images. A neural-symbolic reasoner then integrates the reasoning states of simple propositions to obtain the final solution. Experimental results show that NDCR outperforms other baselines and the proposed method can present inference states and results in the middle step. The paper suggests that neural symbolic calculation may be a worthwhile approach to improve the compositional reasoning and planning of large language models. Additionally, the paper proposes integrating Dual-Process Theory with the Divide-and-Conquer strategy.</sample>

    <sample id="169">In this paper, David Vilar and his colleagues from Google Translate present a systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation. They evaluated the performance of PaLM using the best practices of the MT community and compared it to state-of-the-art systems. The authors used state-of-the-art neural MT metrics and expert-based human evaluation results to assess the performance of PaLM. They found that the quality of the examples is more important than the similarity to the source sentence in zero and one-shot prompting. However, when using five-shot prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the prompting. The authors also found that specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over PaLM translations, but PaLM comes pretty close to a commercial system. In particular, they found that the fluency of PaLM is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but the main difference comes from accuracy, with omission errors being the most common error made by PaLM. Overall, the paper provides recommendations for prompt selection strategies and highlights the importance of selecting high-quality examples for prompting.</sample>

Unlike existing datasets, which often lack diversity and depth, ArgAnalysis35K features 35,000 argument-analysis pairs sourced from high-quality tournaments, expert debaters, intermediate debaters, and novice debaters. The dataset covers 24 diverse themes, providing a broader range of motions than pre-selected ones. It also includes an analysis component that combines claims and premises to explain arguments more comprehensively. Additionally, the dataset incorporates instance-based annotator reliability to mitigate biases and improve annotation quality. Finally, a relevance model assigns scores to arguments based on their relevance to specific themes, enhancing the dataset's utility in various debate contexts. This comprehensive approach makes ArgAnalysis35K a valuable resource for improving argument quality analysis in NLP research.</sample>

    <sample id="179">This paper presents a method called SymbolicToM, which aims to improve the Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning skills in large language models (LLMs). ToM is the ability to reason about the mental state of others and is traditionally measured in humans and LLMs using reading comprehension tasks involving multiple characters. False-belief questions are situations where reality may not match the belief of certain story characters.

The authors propose an inference-time method that uses explicit graphical representations to improve ToM reasoning skills in LLMs. They compute several graphical representations for all combinations of characters up to a predefined maximum ToM level. These graphs are computed using an inference-time algorithm that leverages off-the-shelf NLI and OpenIE models.

The authors test their method with various LLMs and compare it against supervised baselines, specifically a fine-tuned GPT-3 model and Textual Time Travel, which is a model specifically designed for ToM reasoning. They analyze in-domain performance in the well-known ToMi dataset and evaluate robustness with two out-of-domain setups that they designed.

The results show that SymbolicToM dramatically improves out-of-the-box LLM performance, outperforming supervised approaches on out-of-domain story understanding and remaining beneficial on the new linguistic diversity dataset, ParaphrasedToMi.</sample>

    <sample id="181">This paper introduces a new approach to constrained language planning, which involves generating step-by-step instructions for specific goals with multiple constraints. The authors evaluate the performance of large language models in planning for abstract and specific goals and find that they struggle to generate faithful scripts to constraints. To address this issue, they propose an over-generate-then-filter method that improves the quality of generated scripts. They also create a dataset called CoScript, which consists of 55,000 specific goals with scripts, to enable smaller and specialized models for constrained language planning. The results show that T5 fine-tuned on CoScript can generate higher-quality scripts than most large language models. This work provides valuable insights into the development of more accurate and efficient language models for constrained language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="192">The presentation by Yang Luo introduces the CAME (Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization) optimizer, which aims to address the challenge of balancing fast convergence and low memory usage in training large language models. The presenter highlights the limitations of traditional adaptive gradient-based optimizers like Adam, which require triple the memory for keeping first and second moment estimates, and memory-efficient optimizers like Adafactor, which offer drastic memory reduction but at the cost of performance. 

CAME is designed to achieve both fast convergence and low memory usage by introducing a confidence-guided approach that adapts the updating step based on the residual between predicted and generated updates. This method reduces the side effects caused by insecure updating and allows for more stable training processes. The presenter demonstrates the effectiveness of CAME through experiments on BookCorpus, English Wikipedia, and three large language models: BERT, GPT-2, and T5. Results show that CAME achieves significant improvements over Adam and Adafactor, with an increase of about 3.4% in validation accuracy compared to Adafactor using the same number of training steps. Additionally, CAME offers better performance than Adam in pre-training very large models, especially when batch sizes are increased from 8K to 32K. The presentation concludes by emphasizing CAME's efficiency and adaptability in large batch training, making it a promising extension for existing memory-efficient optimizers.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The paper introduces a novel framework called RoHT (Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree) for Explainable Question Answering (XQA). XQA aims to answer complex questions and provide explanations for the answers. The paper identifies two main directions in recent XQA work: neuro-symbolic methods, which translate natural language questions into formal representations, and decompose-based methods, which generate intermediate steps leading to the final answer. However, both have limitations, such as limited recall of answers in neuro-symbolic methods and difficulty in integrating knowledge from heterogeneous sources in decompose-based methods.

RoHT addresses these challenges by proposing a two-stage framework. Firstly, it builds a Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT) to understand the hierarchical compositional structure of a complex question. Secondly, it performs probabilistic reasoning over HQDT to fuse knowledge from a knowledge base and a text corpus at different levels. The framework uses a scheduler to determine appropriate knowledge sources for each node, executors to get answers with probabilities, and an aggregator to output top key answers with the highest probabilities.

The paper evaluates RoHT on two challenging complex QA datasets, KQA Pro and Musique. On KQA Pro, RoHT outperforms existing KB QA methods when using only the incomplete KB and shows substantial improvement when adding Wikipedia as a supplementary text corpus. On Musique, RoHT improves F1 by 11.9 compared with the SOTA method EX(SA) when using only given paragraphs and is also better than TransferNet when using both text and KB.</sample>

The research investigates how these biases are propagated from pretraining data to language models and subsequently affect performance in NLP applications like hate speech detection and fake news detection. Preliminary results show that language models exhibit varying political leanings, with GPT-4 being the most liberal. The study also demonstrates that retraining language models on partisan corpora can shift their ideological coordinates. Furthermore, it is found that language models with different political leanings perform differently on tasks such as hate speech detection and fake news detection, often favoring certain social categories over others. This highlights significant fairness issues in NLP applications and underscores the need for addressing political biases in language model training data.</sample>

The speaker discusses asymmetric approaches, such as Universal Dependencies and Meaning Text Theory, which single out one conjunct as the head of the coordinate structure. In contrast, the Prague approach and Hudson's Word Grammar assume a symmetric structure where all conjuncts are heads.

Przepiórkowski argues for symmetric structures based on the principle of dependency length minimization. He explains that direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, but this can be compensated if the direct object is long. The speaker presents statistics from the Penn Treebank, confirming that left conjuncts tend to be shorter when the governor is on the left or absent. However, when the governor is on the right, the tendency disappears.

The talk provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination and in favor of symmetric structures. For more information, see the paper "Why wouldn't you use universal dependencies" and the full arguments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="217">Our work, "Seen to Unseen: Exploring Compositional Generalization of Multi-Attribute Controllable Dialogue Generation," introduces a novel approach for generating controllable dialogue with multiple attributes. We address the limitations of existing methods that primarily focus on single attributes and lack generation capability for multi-attribute scenarios. Our proposed method, DCG (Disentangled Controllable Generation), learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses a disentanglement loss to disentangle different attribute combinations. We introduce a unified reference-free evaluation framework, MAE, which does not require additional large-scale labeled data. Our experiments demonstrate that DCG outperforms all other baselines in attribute controllability and text equality. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method for transforming seen attributes to unseen combinations. We also evaluate the impact of prompts on compositional generalization using PCA visualization and show that our attribute-oriented prompt method outperforms models that learn an independent prompt for each attribute value. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive solution for compositional generalization in multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation.</sample>

    <sample id="219">In this work, we propose a highlighting task and a multi-stage pipeline for uncovering financial signals in financial reports. The target corpus is the Form 10-K, which contains many details of companies' important activities. We define the reference-to-target structures in our task, where the target and reference refer to the report of our interest and the report at its previous year, respectively. The goal of this highlighting task is to find the rationale (words) of relations between a given pair, T and R. We classify all the pairs into three types: Type β, Revised pairs, and Mismatched pairs. For the model tuning stage, we first use an external dataset, eSNLI, for out-of-domain fine-tuning; it is a natural language inference dataset with token annotation. For intermediate fine-tuning, we use the revised pairs, the revised words as pseudo positive labels, and we randomly label a few other scores as negative. In addition, we mix different objectives. We use the soft labeling techniques by mixing cross-entropy laws and KL divergence. Therefore, we can alleviate the problem of low-quality pseudo-labels. The evaluation dataset includes eSNLI pairs and our released FINAL dataset. We use two metrics to judge the performance. Precision indicates the precision over recall. PCC means the correlation between prediction and annotations. This table shows that our domain-adaptive highlighting model achieved the best performance on FINAL and even preserves the generalization capability, as you can see in the performance of eSNLI. We further observe that our methods can benefit on simulation with the mismatched pairs, which we didn't use during training.</sample>

    <sample id="222">This work, titled "To Adapt or to Annotate: Challenges and Interventions for Domain Adaptation in Open-Domain Question Answering," investigates data interventions that enable out-of-domain generalization in open-domain QA. The authors identify the type of dataset shift a new domain exhibits and determine effective data interventions for specific shifts. They use a general-purpose Wikipedia-based source domain to train both retriever and reader models and test the generalizability of the source model across seven target datasets spanning six different domains.

The researchers explore two overarching methods for generating interventions: zero-shot and few-shot. Few-shot methods involve using a few examples from the target domain to prompt large language models for generating more examples, while zero-shot techniques control interactions among question, answer, and context by varying one variable at a time. The results show that few-shot methods improve retriever performance by 8% on average and reader performance by 11% on average.

To ascertain the nature of incompatibility between the target model and domain, the authors consider existing data shift taxonomy in machine learning. They compute compatibility measures for retriever and reader models and map target datasets onto a 2D grid to estimate the type of dataset shift. The findings indicate that all target sets respond well to few-shot adaptations, while datasets with concept and covariate shift respond well to zero-shot adaptations. For no-shift datasets, little change in performance is observed as the source model already understands the target domain to a great extent. Overall, the work improves reader performance by up to 24% and highlights the importance of targeted data interventions based on the type of shift exhibited by the target dataset.</sample>

    <sample id="227">Grounded language understanding is the ability to map natural language expressions into executable plans or programs in specific environments. This capability has numerous applications, such as smart assistants, semantic search, and domestic robots. However, current language models lack grounding during pre-training, which makes grounded language understanding challenging. Existing research typically uses language models to generate plans directly, but this approach often results in invalid or ungrammatical plans.

The proposed framework, named Pangu, addresses this challenge by focusing on discrimination instead of generation. In Pangu, a symbolic agent proposes candidate plans, and a language model scores and ranks these candidates. This approach allows the language model to focus on discrimination, which is easier for language models to excel at. Pangu has been tested on knowledge-based question answering and has demonstrated outstanding performance across different language models and settings. It also shows strong sample efficiency and robustness under non-i.i.d. settings. The authors argue that discrimination might be a better strategy for grounded language understanding than generation.</sample>

    <sample id="229">This paper presents a joint work by Gabriella Skitalinskaya and Henning Wachsmuth on detecting improvable claims for argumentative writing support. The authors focus on the importance of text revision in professional writing, particularly in argumentative writing, where optimal phrasing is crucial for effectively communicating a message. They introduce two tasks: Suboptimal-Claim detection and Claim Improvement Suggestion, which involve determining whether a claim needs revisions and selecting the types of quality issues that should be improved when revising the claim.

The authors explore the challenges of working with revision-based data, such as representativity and reliability, model complexity and architecture, contextual information, and topical and user bias. They propose strategies to tackle these challenges and present a systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced tasks. Based on their experiments, they conclude that revision-based data can be employed effectively for detecting suboptimal claims and modeling the distance between two claimed versions. They also emphasize the impact of contextual information on the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from.</sample>

    <sample id="233">Simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time, enabling cross-language communication. Current SimulST models have problems such as long and complicated training procedures involving different optimization objectives, and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes. The proposed solution is EDAtt or Encoder-Decoder Attention, which uses already existing offline ST models without re-training or adopting specific architecture for SimulST. EDAtt handles latency through specific parameters and leverages the knowledge acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output. The strategy decides whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to. A word is emitted if the attention is not concentrated, that is, its sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames, meaning that the received information is enough stable. The main results of EDAtt show that it outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models since the curves are shifted over the left. It also shows that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational-aware time, that is the fastest strategy.</sample>

    <sample id="238">In this video, Yebowen Hu from the University of Central Florida introduces MeetingBank, a new benchmark dataset for meeting summarization. The dataset addresses two major challenges: obtaining high-quality meeting summaries and locating trustworthy resources for public meetings. MeetingBank includes 1,366 City Council meetings with nearly 7,000 instances, featuring meeting transcripts, reference summaries, and other useful resources. Data collection involves converting audio to transcripts using Speechmatics API, identifying meeting types, and aligning timestamps to match transcripts with reference summaries.

The dataset provides statistics on the number of meetings, duration, tokens per meeting, speakers per meeting, and the year period of meetings for each city. Summarization instances are gathered for each city, along with average sentence and token counts in source and summary texts. Abstraction levels are measured using coverage and density scores, with most City Council meeting summaries showing coverage between 0.7 to 0.9.

For model evaluation, top-tier summarization systems were tested, including Oracle, LEAD, LexRank, TextRank, BART-Large, Pegasus, Longformer, DialogLM, and HMNet. GPT-3 was evaluated using zero-shot summarization prompting, and results were compared using traditional metrics and human assessments. GPT-3 achieved the highest overall scores in terms of fluency and coherence but performed less impressively in informativeness and factuality.

MeetingBank serves as a valuable tool for researchers to develop advanced meeting summarizers and provides insights into the decision-making process of City Council. The dataset is available for download and can be used for further research.</sample>
    <sample id="241">This paper presents a human-in-the-loop evaluation framework for early misinformation detection, specifically focusing on COVID-19 treatment misinformation. The authors address the limitations of current approaches, which often fail to accurately evaluate systems using live data and lack human-centricity. They propose an end-to-end system that integrates human feedback at various stages, from raw tweet input to actionable outputs. The system consists of two main components: claim detection and policy violation verification. For claim detection, a T5 model is trained for question answering to extract claims, which are then ranked by trendiness before being verified by humans. For policy violation verification, a BERT-based stance classification model determines the author's stance towards unapproved treatments, flagging supporting tweets for human review. The evaluation demonstrates the system's efficacy in detecting unapproved treatments before their debunking news articles appear and its ability to identify policy violations with high accuracy. The paper highlights the importance of involving human content moderators throughout the process to better capture the real utility of early detection systems.</sample>

    <sample id="245">The paper presents a two-step pipeline for finding high-agreement Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers for summarization tasks. The first step involves setting pre-task qualifications on workers, including location, HITs, and HIT Approval Rate. The second step tests the annotator's ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly and their capacity for handling heavy workload. The reference-based task is designed to test the general performance on the true annotation task. The pipeline results show that Pipeline and CloudResearch workers had a significant Spearman's correlation. The pipeline can avoid a waste of time and resources and achieve high agreement at a lower cost. It can also have similar quality to CloudResearch. The paper serves as the best practice for high-agreement annotations at large scale and lower cost, and can avoid resource waste on discarded annotations. In the future, the authors plan to investigate ways to hire high-quality workers, both in terms of high agreement and correctness. They also plan to try multiple applications for tasks, languages, and platforms. However, there are some limitations for this work, such as only testing English summarization on MTurk platform, the designed questions not being "panacea" solutions, and no guarantee for the training of correctness.</sample>

The authors, Sai Kiran Tanikella, Abhinav Joshi, Akshat Sharma, and Ashutosh Modi, present their work on the IL-PCR (Indian Legal Prior Case Retrieval) dataset and the U-CREAT pipeline. They highlight the challenges faced by legal professionals in citing relevant precedents due to the increasing volume of cases. The Prior Case Retrieval Task involves retrieving relevant candidates from a candidate pool that are both relevant to the query document and cited within it.

The presentation explains the IL-PCR Dataset, which consists of 7,070 legal cases with an average of 6.775 citations per query document. This dataset serves as a comprehensive test bed for evaluating PCR algorithms. The U-CREAT pipeline leverages unsupervised learning techniques and an event-based approach to improve retrieval efficiency and generalization across Indian and Canadian legal systems without requiring law or demographic-specific tuning.

The event extraction process involves dependency parsing, pre-processing, and post-processing to form subject-verb-object triplets representing events in the documents. The interaction matrix between query and candidate events is computed and used in different retrieval models to obtain a ranking order of the candidates. The presentation compares various models, including count-based, transformer-based, and event-based models, and highlights the superior performance of event-based models, particularly the Event Filtered Documents model.

Overall, the presentation emphasizes the significance of U-CREAT in advancing prior case retrieval in the legal domain, offering a state-of-the-art method for document retrieval tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="253">The presentation by Mario Ezra Aragón introduces "DisorBERT," a model developed by researchers from Mexico and Spain for detecting signs of mental disorders in social media. The model uses double domain adaptation to improve performance on the target domain, specifically Reddit and mental health, by integrating information from a general language model (BERT) and a lexicon. The approach involves learning the social media language first and then specializing in the mental disorder domain using guided masking. The results show that DisorBERT outperforms other models, including MentalBERT, which was trained with a large amount of data. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through its ability to generate more negative or psychological-oriented words when predicting masked words in sentences related to depression. Future work plans to explore the application of different lexical resources and clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="254">The research work presented by Sun Qi from Nanjing University of Science and Technology focuses on document-level distant relation extraction, aiming to extract relations among entities in a document. The authors address the challenge of noisy data in distantly supervised (DS) datasets by proposing a framework with uncertainty-guided label denoising. They introduce Monte Carlo dropout technology to model uncertainty in the pre-denoising DocRE model, using instance-level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations. A dynamic class uncertainty threshold is proposed to filter pseudo labels with high uncertainty, and an iterative re-labeling strategy is designed to boost performance. The framework outperforms several strong baselines on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving label quality and enhancing the performance of DocRE models.</sample>

    <sample id="258">In this video, Chiang Cheng-Han introduces a new work titled "Can Large Language Models Be an Alternative to Human Evaluation?" The research proposes using large language models to evaluate the quality of text in natural language processing. The approach involves instructing the models with specific instructions and providing them with samples to rate. The motivation behind this work is to find an alternative to human evaluation, which can be unstable and difficult to reproduce.

The experiment conducted in this study involved using large language models to rate stories generated by GPT-2 or written by humans based on four attributes: grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance. The results showed that human raters, specifically English teachers, preferred human-written stories over GPT-2-written ones. However, smaller large language models did not show a clear preference for human-written texts. Nevertheless, two large language models, Davinci and ChatGPT, demonstrated a clear preference for human-written text, similar to human evaluators.

The video also mentions that further questions about the agreement between large language models and human evaluators, the impact of instruction wording changes, and the benefits and costs of using large language models compared to human evaluation are addressed in the paper. Additionally, the results of large language model evaluations on other tasks are discussed in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="259">This paper presents a new approach to cross-lingual semantic parsing, called XSemPLR. The authors propose a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations. They provide a dataset containing 9 datasets in various domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 natural languages in 15 language families. The authors evaluate their benchmark on six settings for training and evaluation, including Translate-Test, Monolingual Model, Monolingual Few-shot setting, Multilingual Model, Cross-lingual Zero-shot transfer, and Cross-lingual Few-shot transfer. They find that Encoder-Decoder models obtain the best performance on all nine datasets, and that pretraining on English natural language can significantly boost the performance of Few-shot on target natural languages. The authors also compare the cross-language performance gap and find that the Zero-shot setting has a significant transfer gap, while the Few-shot setting shortens this gap rapidly. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative types of multilingual language models and shows many interesting findings.</sample>

    <sample id="263">This work presents a novel calibration method to mitigate label biases in in-context learning for text classification tasks. The authors propose a typology of label biases, including vanilla-label bias, context-label bias, and domain-label bias, which captures the effects of uncontextual preferences, context, and task corpus on model predictions. They conduct experiments to confirm that task corpus can introduce significant domain-label bias, leading to poor performance in in-context learning. To address this issue, they propose domain-context calibration, which uses random in-domain words sampled from the task corpus as content-free text to estimate and calibrate the model's bias on each label name. The results show that domain-context calibration significantly improves the average performance of in-context learning on various datasets, particularly those with large domain-label bias. The study also demonstrates that using multiple random words rather than single predefined tokens leads to further improvements. Overall, this work provides a systematic investigation of label biases in in-context learning and proposes a novel calibration method to improve the performance of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="264">The presentation by Lin Wang from Zhejiang University introduces a novel task called Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation (TAVT) to address the challenges of multimodal text generation tasks, particularly in audio-visual text generation. The main challenge is the multi-modal domain shifts such as visual style and audio energy. To overcome this, the TAVT framework consists of three components: an audio-visual meta-mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model generator, and counterfactual contrastive learning. The audio-visual meta-mapper network maps different visual concepts across domains into a unified auditory semantic space. The second model uses a transformer-based encoder and generator with an alpha parameter to evaluate the contribution of different modalities to each word. Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCLL) is introduced to optimize the visual-textual alignment without relying on negative samples. The experimental results show that TAVT outperforms SOTA approaches on cross-datasets and cross-domain settings, even in low-resource domains with only a few labeled data.</sample>

    <sample id="276">This work presents a dataset, IndicMT Eval, for evaluating machine translation metrics for Indian languages. The dataset includes translations from five languages (Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati) into English, generated by seven different translation models or APIs. Human annotators evaluated the translations, marking errors and providing overall scores. The study found that COMET-metric variants had the highest overall correlations with human scores across all languages. The authors fine-tuned the best-performing metric, COMET, using their MQM dataset and observed that IndicCOMET MQM outperformed COMET baselines on three out of five languages. The dataset is publicly available for use in further research.</sample>

It draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of "markedness," which states that there is an unmarked default, and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked. In this method, the authors designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then compare the personas using the Fightin' Words method, which uses weighted log-odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group. This helps capture specific stereotypes and patterns without relying on any specific lexicon.</sample>

    <sample id="280">Shi Tao introduces their work on emotion regulation in conversations, focusing on predicting the emotion label of each utterance in dialogue. The paper proposes a novel attention-based correlation-aware multimodal fusion framework named MultiEMO to address challenges such as unexploited complementarity of multimodal information, unsatisfactory performances in minority emotion classes, and difficulty distinguishing between semantically similar emotions. The framework consists of four key components: unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion, and emotion classification. Contributions include a novel visual feature extractor VisExtNet, a multimodal fusion model called MultiAttn based on bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers, and a Sample-Weighted Focal Contrast loss to address minority and semantically similar emotions. MultiEMO achieves state-of-the-art performances on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets. Limitations include VisExtNet's inability to distinguish between speakers and irrelevant people, large batch size requirements for SWFC loss on MELD, and still worse performance in minority emotions compared to majority classes.</sample>
    <sample id="281">This work, titled "When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-driven, Multilingual Exploration," explores the role of context in translation. The authors, Kayo Yin and colleagues, investigate when translations depend on context and how well models handle these cases. They introduce Pointwise CXMI, a measure for context usage at the sentence or word level, to identify words that require context for translation. The analysis is performed on TED talks translated into 14 languages, focusing on part-of-speech tags, vocabulary items, and individual tokens with high P-CXMI. The MuDA tagger is designed to automatically identify discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion, which are important for context-aware models. The benchmark shows that context-aware models outperform context-agnostic models for certain discourse phenomena, but not others. The study highlights the importance of considering context in machine translation and provides a framework for evaluating translation systems' performance on document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="282">The paper presents a new approach to non-parallel text style transfer, focusing on the story level and discourse level. The primary challenge is imitating the author's linguistic choices at the discourse level, which involves many complicated author linguistic preferences such as narrative techniques. The proposed generation model named StoryTrans learns discourse representations from the source texts and combines this with learnable style embeddings to generate texts in the target styles. A new training objective is designed to reduce stylistic features from the discourse representations and enhance content preservation. The model is trained in two stages: the first stage uses an advisory training framework with self-reconstruction loss, disentanglement loss, sentence order loss, and style classifier loss; the second stage fills the correct style-specific contents and removes the mask token. The evaluation results confirm the efficiency of the model and show that StoryTrans outperforms strong baselines in terms of style control and content preservation.</sample>

    <sample id="284">The paper presents a novel fuzzy span mechanism for enhancing universal information extraction (UIE) by introducing a fuzzy span loss and fuzzy span attention. The traditional span-based UIE models rely on precise boundary positions of annotated spans, which can be ambiguous. To address this issue, the proposed method learns fuzzy boundaries instead of precise ones, representing the target boundary as a continuous distribution of correct probability within a specific range (R-min and R-max). This approach is applied to three main information extraction tasks: named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction.

The authors conducted experiments on datasets such as ACE2004, 2005, ADE, and AST-V2, achieving state-of-the-art results in relationship extraction and competitive performance in ASTE tasks. The ablation study demonstrates that the fuzzy span attention (FSA) improves convergence speed by guiding the module to obtain a reasonable attention distribution, while the fuzzy span loss (FSL) enables the module to fully utilize annotation information, resulting in greater information extraction capability. The combined effect of FSA and FSL produces significant enhancement in performance.</sample>

The video introduces a new taxonomy of factual errors and proposes an evaluation framework based on the Errant metric for grammar error correction. The video explores different training modes for FEC models and finds that training with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yields the best results. The video concludes by emphasizing the need to change evaluation methods for FEC models and combining human-annotated data with synthetic data as a promising direction.</sample>

    <sample id="296">In this video, Valerio Basile presents a collaboration between the University of Turin and Amazon Alexa on Natural Language Understanding. The focus is on irony detection in natural language, which is a difficult task for modern NLP models. To study this problem further, they developed a corpus called EPIC (English Perspectivist Irony Corpus) with data from social media, Reddit, and Twitter, spanning 1.5 years and consisting of about 300 short conversations made of pairs of text. They used crowdsourcing platform Prolific to have people annotate this data, selecting about 15 annotators for each of the five varieties of English, totaling 74 annotators. Each annotator was given 200 texts or short conversations, and extra questions were used as an attention check for quality control. The annotation interface resembled a chat or text interface, asking "Is the reply ironic?" with respect to the context. They observed differences in inter-annotator agreement depending on various dimensions such as gender, age group, nationality, etc. They built different models by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on splits of the datasets based on different annotators. While raw performance did not show particular trends, perspective-aware models showed significant differences in confidence compared to gold standard aggregated models. They found that generations close to each other and geographical distribution of annotators, particularly between the UK and Ireland, caused variations in response.</sample>
    <sample id="297">This project focuses on understanding and recognizing coded rhetoric, specifically dogwhistles, which are terms that convey a hidden message to an in-group while appearing innocuous to an out-group. The researchers developed a typology and glossary of over 340 terms and symbols, including racist, transphobic, and anti-Semitic dogwhistles, collected from various sources. They analyzed historical U.S. political speeches and found that the frequency of racial dogwhistles correlates with the Republican Southern Strategy post-Civil Rights era. The study also evaluated language models like GPT-3's ability to recognize dogwhistles, noting that performance varies depending on the register, type, and prompting strategies. Additionally, they explored how dogwhistles can evade content moderation by reducing toxicity detection scores when standard group labels or slurs are replaced with dogwhistles. This research highlights the importance of understanding context-dependent meaning and the role of dogwhistles in political influence and persuasion.</sample>
    <sample id="298">The findings that led to the conclusion that temporal drift is the main cause of performance loss were from an experiment where models were retrained or continued to pre-train with more recent data.

    <sample id="299">The research presented by Michalis Korakakis and Andreas Vlachos from the University of Cambridge focuses on enhancing the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models through minimax training. NLI models have shown impressive results across various benchmarks, but they often rely on spurious correlations or shortcuts introduced during dataset creation, which can lead to poor performance on out-of-distribution samples. The proposed method aims to mitigate this issue by emphasizing under-represented "hard" training instances that contradict these shortcuts.

The approach involves a minimax training objective where the learner model tries to minimize the NLI task loss, while the auxiliary model attempts to maximize the learner's loss by generating example weights. This process is optimized in an alternating fashion using standard optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. The method does not assume any specific type of shortcuts and relies on the learner's dynamics to generate example weights. A feed-forward network models the auxiliary, and the method is evaluated on three analytic datasets (MNLI, FEVER, QQP) and their corresponding adversarial test sets (HANS Symmetric, PAWS).

The results show that the minimax training objective consistently improves out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy compared to an Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training model and the best-performing shortcut mitigation methods. The study also explores the effects of pre-training the learner, the size of the auxiliary, and conducts qualitative evaluations of the learned example weight distribution. The researchers invite further discussion during their poster session.</sample>
    <sample id="300">Interactive dictation is a process where users can use their voice to both dictate and edit a document in a natural and intuitive manner. The task involves flexible interleaving of dictation and editing, not separated by a trigger word, and using intuitive and open-ended natural language utterances to specify edits. The contribution includes introducing and formalizing the task of interactive dictation, designing a data collection interface and building a dataset for this task, and creating a baseline system for this task. The paper discusses the four-step procedure involved in the task, including ASR recognition module, speech transcript segmentation, command extraction and normalization, and executing each dictation and command utterance in sequence until the final document state is arrived at. The paper also evaluates the performance of different models for the task, including T5 and GPT-3, and provides insights into the trade-off between runtime and accuracy. The paper concludes that there is much more room for progress in this task and welcomes more work on it.</sample>
    <sample id="302">It is necessary to permute the tokens for the output sequence because, after tagging each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output, we have all the right tokens but they are not ordered.

    <sample id="303">The authors recommended that model owners should increase transparency about bias mitigation methods because it is important to understand the underlying causes of these patterns and to develop effective strategies to mitigate them.

    <sample id="304">Minimal-pair unacceptable inputs refer to the creation of longer sequences by adding acceptable or unacceptable sentences from the same data set as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query. This is done to test the model's acceptability throughout the context window, simulating longer sequences and evaluating whether the model's acceptability judgments are impacted by any context, such as whether the context is coming from a different subset of the data set or a completely unrelated domain like Wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="305">In this video, Dawei presents their recent work on weakly supervised learning (WSL), a method that uses weak labeling sources to label data without manual annotations. However, the noisy labels can cause neural networks to memorize the label noise and not generalize well. The research questions addressed in the video are: 1) Is clean validation data necessary for WSL? 2) How many clean samples do we need? 3) Should we only use clean samples for validation or there are better ways to utilize them?

The findings show that recent WSL methods require clean validation samples to work properly, and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked. Increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches achieve better performance, but training on clean samples directly will even achieve better performance. Continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL.

The concrete recommendations for future work are: 1) Report the model selection criteria, such as if the model selection is done via clean validation samples. 2) WSL approaches should be compared with few-shot learning baselines, as both work on clean samples. 3) Continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim discuss their work on entity tracking in language models, focusing on the ability of agents to understand and track changes in entities within a discourse. They argue that this is crucial for understanding longer discourses but have not been systematically investigated. The research aims to determine how well large language models can track entities.

The team designed a task involving boxes and objects, where the input includes an initial description of each box's contents and multiple state-changing operations. The model must predict the final contents of each box based on the initial description and operations. To prevent the model from using heuristics, various measures were implemented.

Experiments with Flan-T5 and GPT-3/-3.5 models showed that most models simply repeated the initial state, while only text-davinci-003 exhibited non-trivial tracking. The results suggest that pre-training on code is responsible for making this capacity surface in pre-trained language models. Smaller models like T5-base can learn to perform entity tracking with direct fine-tuning, but randomly initialized models cannot learn the state tracking task even with direct supervision.

The study highlights the importance of pre-training in developing entity tracking abilities in language models and suggests that these abilities may generalize beyond the specific set-up used in the experiment.</sample>
    <sample id="307">The authors used evaluation metrics such as named entity recognition, classification, part-of-speech tagging, and question answering to compare their models with baseline models like CamemBERT OSCAR 138 GB, CamemBERT OSCAR 4 GB, CamemBERT CCNET 4 GB, PubMedBERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT.</sample>
    <sample id="308">The presentation by Jenny, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, focuses on the concept of positionality in NLP research and its impact on model performance. Positionality refers to the perspectives that individuals hold based on their demographics, identity, and life experiences, which can influence research decisions and outcomes. The study aims to investigate whether datasets and models have positionality by comparing annotations from diverse annotators with existing datasets and models.

The framework NLPositionality is introduced, which involves re-annotating data sets with diverse annotators and comparing their annotations with existing datasets and models using Pearson's R correlation score. This approach differs from traditional annotator disagreement literature by focusing on comparing end users with models and datasets rather than just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions.

The study utilized Lab in the Wild, an online crowdsourcing platform, to recruit diverse volunteers from 87 countries. Over 16,000 annotations from 1000 annotators were collected for tasks such as social acceptability, toxicity, and hate speech detection. The results indicate that there is positionality in NLP, with models and data sets being most aligned to English-speaking countries and people with higher educational levels. However, non-binary individuals are less aligned compared to men and women.

To address these findings, the presentation recommends keeping records of all relevant design choices throughout the research process, conducting NLP research with a perspectivist lens, and building specialized datasets and models within specific communities. The presentation concludes by emphasizing that inclusive NLP is not just about making all technologies work for everyone but also about understanding and addressing the biases present in NLP systems.</sample>

    <sample id="317">The paper "CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information Extractors" by Peng Li from Fudan University presents a novel approach to information extraction tasks, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction. The traditional methods rely on pre-trained language models like T5 and GPT-3, which operate in a text-to-text manner during the pre-training stage. However, these models struggle with generating structured outputs during the inference phase, requiring large amounts of structured training data and special decoding strategies.

To address this issue, the authors propose CodeIE, which transforms the text-to-structured information extraction task into a structure-to-structure code generation task using code large language models like Codex. This approach ensures aligned structures in the output stage and eliminates the need for special decoding strategies.

The paper evaluates the proposed method on three named entity recognition datasets and four relation extraction datasets, comparing it with traditional baseline models like UIE and natural language large language models like GPT-3. The results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the traditional baseline models, especially in few-shot settings.

The authors also conduct a detailed analysis of the phenomenon, observing that perplexity computed on text format inputs using models like T5 is generally higher than that of code format samples using models like CodeT5. They also note that using Codex for information extraction tasks outperforms GPT-3 overall, and that code format prompts perform better than text format prompts, especially in terms of recall.

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of code generation models for information extraction tasks and highlights the potential of using code large language models for such tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="322">Enrico will present at ACL 23 on the topic of "What does a Text Classifier Learn about Morality?" He begins by defining morality as our internal compass that helps us distinguish right from wrong. He then explains that current approaches to understanding morality in text often treat it as a singular scale between immoral and moral, which can hide the pluralistic nature of human morality. Enrico introduces the Moral Foundation Theory, which posits that there are five different ways humans perceive morality, each prioritized differently by individuals. He discusses how this theory has been applied in NLP and presents his own research using explainable AI techniques to understand how language models learn about morality. His study focuses on the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus, examining differences in morality expression across domains like #AllLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter. Enrico demonstrates that language models recognize these domain-specific differences, such as the varying attitudes towards subversion in ALM and BLM. He concludes by warning that using a single model for multiple domains can lead to misunderstandings of morality.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The paper titled "Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense QA" by Yujie Wang from Shanxi University, China, addresses the challenge of Commonsense QA by integrating knowledge from both language models and knowledge bases. The authors propose a method called DHLK to improve the interaction between these modalities and optimize the structure and knowledge representation of the heterogeneous knowledge graph (HKG). They use a two-stage pruning strategy and KRL to build the HKG based on multiple knowledge bases, including ConceptNet, WordNet, and Wiktionary. The HKG is then encoded and fused using RoBERTa and Mask Self-Attention, with dynamic entity removal based on attention weights. Relation Mask Self-Attention (RMSA) is introduced to model subgraphs, and TransE is used to optimize entity and relation embeddings. The final answer prediction incorporates HKG path information into the QA context, resulting in good performance on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA compared to other LM and HKG methods.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Yes, language models have different political biases. The study mentioned in the presentation demonstrates that language models can occupy all four quadrants on the political spectrum and have varying degrees of social liberal or conservative leanings. These biases are influenced by the pretraining data, which can include partisan corpora from news and social media. The study also shows that language models can pick up polarization prevalent in modern society and exhibit different performance patterns on downstream tasks such as hate speech detection and fake news detection based on their political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="326">Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when an individual holds two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or attitudes simultaneously. This inconsistency between the beliefs or actions can lead to discomfort, anxiety, or tension, as the person tries to reconcile the conflicting information. In everyday life, cognitive dissonance often arises in situations where a person's actions or decisions are inconsistent with their stated beliefs or values. For example, a person who smokes cigarettes despite knowing that they could be harmful to their health is experiencing cognitive dissonance.

Studying cognitive dissonance in language can provide valuable insights into human behavior, decision-making processes, and mental health. By understanding how people express dissonance in their language, researchers can better track trends, belief values, and attitude changes in populations. Additionally, cognitive dissonance can help in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups, as well as personal cognitive styles and decision-making processes.</sample>
    <sample id="327">The paper presents a novel vision-language (VL) modal architecture called ManagerTower, which aims to improve the performance of VL models by adaptively aggregating insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels. The authors address the limitations of previous models such as BridgeTower and METER, which suffer from ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal layer representations and limited scalability. ManagerTower introduces managers in each cross-modal layer to gather and combine the insights of pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels, allowing for more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion. The authors use RoBERTa and CLIP-ViT base as unimodal encoders and show that ManagerTower achieves superior performances on various downstream tasks, especially on Wikivideo test standard with 39.15% accuracy improvement. The paper also provides visualizations of the average aggregation weight of textual or visual managers in each cross-modal layer over all samples in VQAv2 dataset, showing distinct trends between static and adaptive managers.</sample>

    <sample id="329">The paper presents a method for generating structured pseudo-labels for noise-resistant zero-shot video sentence localization. The authors propose using a pre-trained image caption model to generate more complex free-form pseudo-queries, and then use a pre-trained model to measure the relevance between individual frames and pseudo-queries to generate pseudo-events that guarantee high relevance between the video inside the event and the query, and low relevance between the video outside the event and the query. They also reduce the weight of noisy samples and create noisy labels to reduce the influence of label noise. The authors perform experiments on two datasets, ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA, and show that their method outperforms other zero-shot methods on most metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="333">The paper presents a novel training framework called INK (Injecting kNN Knowledge in Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation) for neural machine translation. The authors aim to enhance the generalization ability of NMT models by smoothing predictions according to nearest neighbors in the representation space. They propose a two-step training loop: first, extracting kNN knowledge from a datastore to guide the adapter to adjust representations; second, updating representations asynchronously using three kinds of alignment methods: aligning contextualized representation and token embeddings, aligning contextualized representations and kNN token embeddings, and aligning contextualized representations of the same target token. The INK system outperforms state-of-the-art kNN-MT systems and achieves the best performance after smoothing the representation space. Experimental results show that INK achieves an average gain of 1.99 COMET score and 1.0 BLEU score compared with the state-of-the-art kNN-MT systems.</sample>

    <sample id="337">Our research focuses on developing a graph-based method for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word embedding learning. We introduce the Word Relationship Graph, which captures the lexical rules of word formation and association. When an OOV word appears, it is tokenized into wordpieces and associated with relevant words, forming a two-level graph around the OOV word. Each word or wordpiece acts as a node in the graph, and its corresponding word embedding serves as the node attribute. To address the issue of assigning attributes to OOV nodes, we utilize a self-attention network that assigns attributes based on the characters of the OOV words. We apply two levels of Graph Attention Network that we concatenate, and fuse the initial input with the hidden embedding of each layer, resulting in a node-level representation. To capture the whole graph information and summarize the word formation, we incorporate a readout block layer that's a graph-level representation. We apply contrastive learning in the loss function with NT-XENT positive samples from the graph, such as two-hop relevant neighbor words, synonyms, or the OOV word itself. Through extensive experiments, we have demonstrated that our model of performance is superior to baselines in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, which proves the effectiveness of learning OOV words by word formation. Our model can bring some profits to both static and contextual models in downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="338">In this presentation, Bingsheng introduces a collaborative research work on evaluating the quality of human natural language explanations. The study aims to address the challenge of systematically comparing subjective and task-dependent explanations by developing a unified structure for various tasks. The researchers propose a novel evaluation metric called TREU, which extends the simulatability score to consider the helpfulness of explanations during fine-tuning. They evaluate human explanations across five datasets using T5 and BART models, demonstrating that their metric outperforms the simulatability score in reflecting the beneficial impact of high-quality explanations on model predictions. The study highlights the importance of considering task differences and explanation utility at different stages of model training and inference.</sample>

    <sample id="340">Kuan-Hao Huang from UCLA and his team have developed a large-scale, syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset called ParaAMR. This dataset is constructed using AMR (Abstract Meaning Representations) back-translation, which involves translating a sentence to another language and then back to generate syntactically diverse paraphrases. The dataset contains around 15 million source sentences with approximately 6.9 paraphrases per source sentence. Compared to other datasets that use back-translation, ParaAMR generates more syntactically diverse paraphrases while preserving good semantic similarity. The dataset has been shown to benefit several NLP applications, including learning sentence embeddings, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few-shot learning. The ParaAMR dataset is available for use in the research community.</sample>

    <sample id="342">In this presentation, Gao Jingsheng introduces the paper "LiveChat: A Large-Scale Personalized Dialogue Dataset Automatically Constructed from Live Streaming." The paper, conducted by researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Xiaobing.AI, aims to address the challenges in constructing large-scale dialogue datasets, particularly for personalized and multi-party conversations. The existing datasets are mostly text-sourced and limited in scale due to manual annotations. The LiveChat dataset is video-sourced, larger in scale, and includes persona information for personalized dialogue generation. The dataset is constructed through three steps: extracting audio from videos, transcribing audio into utterances, and collecting audience comments to construct dialogues using a reply-to-whom matching method. The paper also presents experiments on two benchmark tasks: response modeling and addressee recognition, showing that the extracted persona profiles and longer average sessions benefit the final results. Additionally, the performance of pre-trained dialogue models on LiveChat is investigated, with BART outperforming other models. The presentation concludes with plans to focus on efficient transfer learning of LLMs for LiveChat in future research.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree-based methods include the need for considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of logical forms, which can be complicated and sometimes computationally expensive. Additionally, obtaining trees may involve specialized grammar-induction procedures, which can also be challenging.</sample>
    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a neural seq2seq model that can handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases without relying on trees. The model predicts the output from the input in two steps: first, it tags each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output; second, it uses another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order. The permutation model is flexible and expressive, but finding the highest-scoring permutation is NP-hard. To address this challenge, the authors approximate the problem with a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation that allows them to backpropagate through the solution and learn linguistically more plausible permutations. The experimental results show that the model outperforms other treeless models on generalization to deeper recursion. However, some other kinds of structural generalization remain challenging. The paper addresses interesting technical challenges such as inducing the alignment as part of the training and finding the highest-scoring permutation.</sample>

    <sample id="348">This paper, titled "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models," explores the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs). The authors address the limitations of existing measures, which often rely on hand-constructed data sets and only measure specific stereotypes. They propose a new method that uses instruction-tuned LLMs to generate personas based on various demographic identities. By comparing these generated personas with human-written responses, they identify marked words that distinguish between unmarked and marked groups, revealing harmful patterns and essentializing narratives. The results show that while generated personas contain more stereotypes than human-written ones, the distribution of words is different, with positive or non-negative words facilitating stereotypes. The authors recommend addressing positive stereotypes, using an intersectional lens, and increasing transparency about bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The paper "What’s the Meaning of Superhuman Performance in Today’s NLU?" by Simone Tedeschi and several renowned researchers investigates how reliably leaderboard scores compare models and humans in NLP and NLU. The authors analyze SuperGLUE and SQuAD benchmarks, which are popular frameworks for evaluating systems of language understanding. They highlight that while systems can outperform humans on these benchmarks, there are several sources of error that make the comparison unfair, such as different evaluation sets, errors in ground-truth answers, and varying pay rates for human annotators. The authors argue that claims about superhuman performance are not scientifically meaningful without considering these factors. They provide recommendations to avoid repeating the same mistakes and construct more reliable benchmarks.</sample>
    <sample id="351">The paper "Do CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023?" by Shuheng investigates the generalization of models developed for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task using the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The authors address whether these models can generalize to modern data and identify factors that contribute to poor generalization. They introduce the CoNLL++ dataset, which is a modern dataset collected from Reuters News in 2020, annotated with the same guidelines as CoNLL-2003. The study evaluates over 20 models fine-tuned on CoNLL-2003 and assesses their performance on both CoNLL-03 and CoNLL++. The results show that transformer models, larger model sizes, and more fine-tuning examples are crucial for good generalization. The main cause of performance drop is temporal drift, not adaptive overfitting, which contradicts the common belief that reusing test sets leads to overfitting. The paper concludes that CoNLL-2003 taggers still perform well in 2023 but calls for further research to improve model generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" by Haau-Sing Li, Mohsen Mesgar, André F. T. Martins, and Iryna Gurevych addresses the challenge of input underspecification in code generation and program synthesis. The authors propose a method to create CodeClarQA, a synthetic dataset with clarifications on key operations, and a pipeline of code generation by asking clarification questions. They identify key operations and corresponding documentation from the code, represent them in latent space using their schemata, and compute similarity scores of all schema element pairs between an NLD and the operation documentation. If all element pairs for the similarity score is lower than threshold T, the key operation is missing; otherwise, it is aligned. The authors also hire annotators to annotate the validation set and the test set. They adopt templates to create CQAs for missing key operations and generate two types of questions: yes-or-no questions or multiple-choice questions. The paper presents the results of identifying missing key operations and error analysis. The authors also discuss the pipeline of the CQ-driven code generation, which includes a Clarification Need Predictor, a Question Selector, and a Code Generator. They test their pipeline and analyze the results, concluding that clarified key operations are the reason for better generated code.</sample>

    <sample id="361">Armineh Nourbakhsh, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and research director at JP Morgan AI Research, presented her work titled "CounterComp" which aims to improve compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning using counterfactual scenarios. The work focuses on the question answering task in financial tables, where multiple arithmetic operations are required to derive answers. State-of-the-art neural models struggle with tasks that involve more than two steps due to memorizing spurious patterns. To address this, CounterComp mines counterfactual scenarios from training samples by treating each sample as an anchor and identifying positive and negative examples based on the change in output when components of the question are altered. An auxiliary metric learning loss is added to the training procedure, with a dynamic margin measuring the extent of change between examples. This approach improves performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples, enhancing compositional generalization. Qualitative results show that CounterComp helps the model attend to more meaningful tokens during training, leading to better performance.
