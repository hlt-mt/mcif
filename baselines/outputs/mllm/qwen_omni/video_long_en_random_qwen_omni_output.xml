    <sample id="254">The document discusses a multi-phase training strategy for a document-level relation extraction framework. It introduces a novel instance-level uncertainty estimation method to measure the reliability of instance-level pseudo labels, specifically addressing the problem of long-tail in DocRE. The framework leverages uncertainty estimation to filter high uncertainty pseudo labels, improving the label quality of DS (DDS) data. The paper proposes an iterative re-label strategy to obtain high uncertainty pseudo labels, which are then used to train the pre-denoising DocRE model with uncertainty scores on DDS data.

It highlights the use of a novel visual feature extractor named VisExtNet, which effectively captures visual cues of interlocutors without modeling redundant scene information. The framework also includes a multimodal fusion model called MultiAttn, which integrates textual, audio, and visual modalities through bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers. The presentation mentions the use of a sample-weighted focal contrastive loss function to address the imbalance problem in minority emotion classes. Experimental results show that MultiEMO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, with improvements in minority and semantically similar emotion classes. However, it also points out limitations such as the class imbalanced issue with MELD and the performance of MultiEMO in minority emotions being worse than majority classes.</sample>

The text discusses a novel fuzzy span mechanism called FSUIE, which is designed to enhance universal information extraction. It addresses the limitations of existing UIE, which heavily relies on the precise boundary positions of annotated spans. FSUIE introduces a fuzzy span boundary, allowing for more flexible and adaptive span extraction. The mechanism focuses on local features rather than global features, which helps in better handling ambiguity in span boundaries. The paper also presents a fuzzy span loss function to ensure that the fuzzy span boundaries are precise and one-hot distributed. Additionally, it introduces a fuzzy span attention mechanism to focus on local features, which helps in improving the model's performance.</sample>
    <sample id="285">The speaker discusses the challenges in evaluating the factual accuracy of summaries generated by models, particularly in the context of dialogue summarization. They highlight that summaries often contain factual errors, and two main solutions are direct model design for better factuality and Factual Error Correction (FEC) for model-generated summaries. The speaker explains that FEC models are evaluated using factuality metrics like FactCC, but these metrics have limitations, such as being an overall score and not reliable on their own. They also mention that FEC models can sometimes ignore the original summary content and generate different but factually correct summaries, which may not correct factual errors. The speaker suggests introducing reference corrections to manually annotate factual errors in model-generated summaries and introduces the idea of using reference corrections for training FEC models, which provides more valuable data and creates a more comprehensive evaluation framework.</sample>
