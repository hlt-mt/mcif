    <sample id="67">The presentation discusses the causes and cures for interference in multilingual translation models. It starts by explaining that these models can benefit from synergy between language pairs but also suffer from interference. For example, training to translate English to Finnish might improve English to Estonian quality, while English to Chinese could have a negative effect. Many methods have been proposed to alleviate interference, but they often demonstrate using small models and do not always work better than a tuned baseline. The work aims to identify the main factors contributing to interference or synergy. Severe interference occurs when the model is very small compared to the data size. Tuning the sampling temperature is key to achieving strong performance. The presentation also explores when interference occurs and whether we really need specialized algorithms to mitigate it. It concludes that language similarity is not a dominant factor for interference, and severe interference happens in parameter poverty settings. Tuned temperature is key for strong baselines.</sample>

    <sample id="113">Sure, here is the text transcript of the English content: "Hello, I'm James Finch and I'm Sarah Finch, and today we'll tell you all about ABC eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI. This work was done by the Emory NLP lab led by Professor Jinho Choi at Emory University and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art. The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a Likert scale. These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality, but dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore, you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level. One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality, such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or Likert scale methods. However, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation. Our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain</sample>

    <sample id="146">The content discusses a presentation on dialogue summarization, focusing on the challenges and solutions related to omission in summaries. The speaker, a PhD student from Fudan University, introduces the topic by explaining that dialogue summarization involves producing concise summaries for various scenarios, such as customer service, medical consultations, meetings, movie scripts, and chat logs. The presentation highlights that while large language models have made significant progress in generating fluent and coherent summaries, they still struggle with factual errors and omissions, which can lead to incomplete summaries.

The speaker emphasizes that few works have systematically analyzed the omission problem in dialogue summarization. They present data showing that even state-of-the-art models have high omission rates, with about 70% of summaries suffering from this issue. This indicates that addressing omission is crucial for improving the quality of dialogue summarization.

To tackle this problem, the speaker proposes a new task definition for omission detection, which involves identifying possible omissions in generated summaries. They also introduce a new dataset called OLDs, which includes five domains and five models, providing 10 candidate summaries for each dialogue. This dataset aims to support research on omission detection and summarization quality evaluation.

This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate. PaLM is a 540 billion parameter language model presented last year in 2022. It's trained on a large collection of text, comprising 780 billion tokens. At the time of publication, it achieved state-of-the-art in hundreds of NLP tasks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation. We evaluate the translation quality of such models using the best practices of the MT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid test/train overlap and overfitting on evaluation data. We compare to most recent WMT submissions, SOTA systems using most recent training data. We use state-of-the-art NMT metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies. The prompting has a big influence on the performance of the LLMs for translation. As we can see in a simple experiment where we use one-shot prompting and provided two different prompts</sample>
    <sample id="157">The video discusses a research project on dialogue summarization using static-dynamic graph-based methods. It starts with an introduction to the topic, explaining that dialogue summarization aims to distill key information from a dialogue context into a concise summary. The presenter, Shen Gao from Shandong University, introduces the concept of static-dynamic structure fusion graphs, which combine static and dynamic graph structures to capture both the current and historical interactions in a dialogue. The video then delves into the process of dialogue summarization, showing how static-dynamic graph-based methods can be applied to generate summaries. It explains that static graphs represent the current state of the dialogue, while dynamic graphs capture the evolution of the dialogue over time. The presenter highlights the importance of integrating these two types of graphs to create a comprehensive summary. The video also touches on the challenges of dialogue summarization, such as handling the complexity of multi-participant dialogues and ensuring that the summary is both accurate and concise. It concludes by emphasizing the potential applications of this research in fields like customer service, customer support, and educational settings, where efficient and effective communication is crucial.</sample>
    <sample id="158">The presentation discusses a method called Dual Cache for improving coreference resolution in long documents. It starts by explaining coreference resolution, which involves identifying and linking mentions of the same entity within a text. The presenter, Xiangkun Hu from AWS, introduces the concept of cache-based models, which use a fixed-size cache to store entity representations, reducing complexity to a linear level. Conventional approaches have quadratic complexity, leading to high computation and memory consumption. The Dual Cache method uses a dual cache system: an L-cache for local entities with an LRU policy and a G-cache for global entities with an LFU policy. When the cache is full, entities are evicted based on policies like LRU. The presentation also covers experiments on public benchmarks, showing that Dual Cache outperforms baselines even with unbounded memory. It mentions that Dual Cache largely reduces cache misses and is the most cost-effective compared to single cache methods.</sample>

The study evaluates the ability of LLMs to plan for specific goals with constraints and develops a method to distill knowledge from LLMs for smaller models. The proposed method uses symbolic knowledge distillation and generates 55,000 scripts based on a constrained language planning dataset. The dataset is annotated by humans to ensure the generated texts are faithful to the constraints. The study finds that smaller LMs fine-tuned on Coscript can generate higher quality scripts than larger LMs. The proposed method greatly improves the planning quality of LLMs.</sample>

The presentation begins with a slide titled "FSUIE: Motivation," where the speaker discusses the limitations of existing UIE models, particularly their reliance on precise span boundaries. The speaker introduces FSUIE as a solution that leverages fuzzy span boundaries to improve information extraction. The motivation for FSUIE is highlighted by the need to address the ambiguity in span boundary annotation, which can vary among annotators. The speaker explains that FSUIE aims to learn fuzzy boundaries instead of precise ones, which can better adapt to the variability in annotation. Additionally, the speaker points out a mismatch between transformer feature extraction and information extraction, suggesting that FSUIE can help bridge this gap by focusing on local features rather than global ones.</sample>
    <sample id="285">The speaker, Mingqi Gao from Peking University and Huawei Cloud, is presenting a research paper titled "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation Framework." The paper discusses the challenges of factual errors in dialogue summaries and proposes a solution using a fine-grained evaluation framework. The speaker explains that summaries often contain factual errors, and there are two main solutions: designing better summarization models for factuality and using Factual Error Correction, FEC, models. FEC models are designed to correct factual errors in model-generated summaries. The speaker highlights the importance of evaluating FEC models effectively, noting that current evaluation methods, such as FactCC, are not reliable and can blur the line between different types of solutions. The speaker suggests introducing manually annotated reference corrections to address these issues, which can provide more valuable data for training FEC models and create a more comprehensive evaluation framework.</sample>

    <sample id="338">Sure! Here's a summary of the English content:

The presentation discusses the evaluation of human explanations in natural language processing. It starts with a question: "Are human explanations always helpful?" The researchers, including Bingsheng Yao, Prithviraj Sen, Lucian Popa, James Hendler, and Dakuo Wang, explore this through various aspects such as motivations, shoulders of giants, primary contributions, and future work. They introduce a unified structure for evaluating human explanations, focusing on training NLG models to boost prediction performance and enhance model reasoning. The presentation also addresses the subjectivity of human evaluations and the lack of a gold standard for measuring the quality of explanations. They propose a novel evaluation metric called TREU, which evaluates the helpfulness of explanations at both fine-tuning and inference stages. The researchers find that CoS-E explanations are less helpful than ECQA on baseline models, but fine-tuning with infusion can teach models to rely on explanations for prediction. They also observe that the helpfulness of human explanations depends on the task and explanation style.</sample>

    <sample id="348">The presentation explores the use of natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models, focusing on the concept of 'Marked Personas'. It discusses the limitations of existing stereotype measures, such as the trade-off between specificity and generalizability, reliance on fixed datasets, and failure to account for intersectionality. The presenter, Myra Cheng, introduces a method that uses prompts to generate personas, which can be generalized to any demographic. This method is inspired by psych studies and leverages the ability of newer instruction-tuned language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to respond to instructions in prompts. The presentation also delves into the analysis of persona examples generated by GPT-4, highlighting the different portrayals of various groups. It concludes with recommendations for addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, emphasizing the importance of transparency and intersectional lens in bias mitigation.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The presentation discusses the concept of superhuman performance in today's NLU systems. It highlights that while systems can achieve human-level or even superhuman performance on certain benchmarks, these achievements are often based on simple procedural tasks like arithmetic and extreme memory-intensive tasks. The paper argues that most NLU tasks require knowledge and inference, which current models struggle with. It mentions evidence of models' brittleness, such as out-of-domain generalization, adversarial attacks, and sensitivity to basic linguistic perturbations. The SuperGLUE benchmark is introduced as a well-known framework for evaluating general-purpose language understanding models, including tasks like Word in Context, Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension, and Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Knowledge. The presentation also touches on the issue of human baselines being outperformed on 6 out of 10 SuperGLUE tasks, leading to a discussion about the reliability of leaderboard scores and the need for fairer and more transparent benchmarks.</sample>
    <sample id="351">The presentation discusses the effectiveness of CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers in 2023. It explores whether these models can generalize to modern data, focusing on named entity recognition and generalization. The study investigates the impact of model architecture, model size, and the number of fine-tuning examples on generalization. It concludes that larger models and more fine-tuning examples improve generalization. The performance drop is attributed to temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting. The presentation also suggests that CoNLL-2003 taggers still work well, but performance degrades with larger temporal gaps.</sample>
