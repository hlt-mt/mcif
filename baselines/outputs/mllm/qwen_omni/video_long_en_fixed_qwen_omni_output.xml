The authors propose a method to improve pretraining techniques for code-switched data, focusing on enhancing the representation of switch-point information in the final layer representations.

    <sample id="280">The document discusses the application of MultiEMO, a multimodal fusion framework for emotion recognition in conversations, in tackling the asynchronization of emotional tendencies from different modalities. It highlights the use of a novel visual feature extractor named VisExtNet, which effectively captures visual cues of interlocutors without modeling redundant scene information. The framework integrates textual, audio, and visual modalities through a multimodal fusion process, utilizing a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layer to model correlations across modalities. The document also introduces a Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive (SWFC) loss function to address the difficulty of classifying minority and semantically similar emotion classes. Experimental results on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that MultiEMO achieves state-of-the-art performance, although it faces limitations such as class imbalance and computational expense.</sample>
