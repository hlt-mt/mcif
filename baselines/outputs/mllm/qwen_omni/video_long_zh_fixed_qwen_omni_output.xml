    <sample id="2">The presentation discusses the methodology and experimental results of a computational linguistics project. It begins with an introduction to the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics held in Toronto, Canada, from July 9-14, 2023. The focus is on a multi-modal pre-training model called LayoutMask, which enhances text-layout interaction in document understanding.

The presentation outlines the motivation for using LayoutMask, which addresses reading order issues in visually rich documents. The contribution of LayoutMask includes a multi-modal pre-training model, local 1D position instead of global 1D position, and enhanced text-layout interactions with novel masking strategies and pre-training objectives.

The methodology section explains the pre-training tasks, representation, token embedding, local 1D position, segment 2D position, and masking strategy. The experimental results show the average F1 scores for different 1D and 2D position combinations, with the best results highlighted in boldface.

The presentation concludes with a thank you note and contact information for further inquiries.</sample>

### 婚姻与同居的比较

婚姻与同居之间的主要区别在于法律和情感上的不同。婚姻是一种正式的法律关系，它赋予了伴侣一系列的法律权利和义务。在婚姻中，夫妻双方被视为一个经济单位，他们的财产和债务通常被合并处理。婚姻还涉及到继承权和监护权等问题。相比之下，同居关系则没有这些法律上的约束。同居关系通常基于双方的共同生活和相互支持，但没有法律上的正式认可。

婚姻通常需要双方的同意和承诺，而同居则更多地基于情感和生活方式的相似性。婚姻通常需要在法律上注册，而同居则不需要。婚姻通常需要双方的同意和承诺，而同居则更多地基于情感和生活方式的相似性。婚姻通常需要在法律上注册，而同居则不需要。

It starts by introducing the concept of human morality and how it is used to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong. The video then goes on to explain how morality classifiers are used in natural language processing, NLP, to classify text as moral or immoral. The video also mentions the Moral Foundation Theory, which suggests that there are six basic moral foundations that people use to make moral judgments. These foundations include care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. The video explains how these foundations are used to classify text as moral or immoral. Finally, the video concludes by explaining how morality classifiers are used to classify text as moral or immoral.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The document discusses a comprehensive approach to knowledge representation and reasoning in the context of a heterogeneous knowledge graph (HKG). It begins by introducing the HKG, which is built on multiple knowledge bases and optimized through a two-stage pruning strategy and knowledge representation learning (KRL). The document emphasizes the importance of dynamic pruning based on the language model's attention weights to address issues like noisy entities and limited interaction between subgraphs and text.

The method, DHLK, involves building the HKG, optimizing its structure and knowledge representation, and implementing the fusion and encoding of two modalities through a language model. The document also highlights the use of KeyBERT for extracting key entities from the QA context and the use of KeyBERT to extract paths within two hops in ConceptNet by key entities.

Furthermore, the document presents the experimental results of the DHLK method on the official test sets of CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA, showing promising performance. It also discusses the KG process, using KeyBERT to extract key entities from the QA context and extracting paths within two hops in ConceptNet by key entities.

Overall, the document provides a detailed and systematic approach to knowledge representation and reasoning, emphasizing the importance of dynamic pruning, entity and relationship optimization, and the use of advanced techniques like KeyBERT</sample>

The study aims to improve the accuracy of video sentence localization by generating free-form pseudo-queries using image description models and generating pseudo-events based on the event temporal structure. The study also focuses on reducing noise during training by sampling re-weight and label refinement, and calculating similarity between pseudo-query and video frames. The drawbacks of existing zero-shot methods include simple pseudo-queries, unalignment between pseudo-events and pseudo-queries, and ignoring noise in pseudo-labels. The study proposes a method that addresses these issues by generating free-form pseudo-queries, generating pseudo-events based on the event temporal structure, and reducing noise during training. The study also includes experiments and results comparing the proposed method with other existing methods.</sample>

It highlights the benefits of using kNN knowledge to improve the representation space of the model, leading to better translation performance. The presentation also covers the drawbacks of using kNN knowledge, such as the need for a large datastore and the inability to update representations once constructed. To overcome these issues, the presentation proposes a novel training framework called INK, which iteratively refines the representation space of the NMT model according to kNN knowledge. The INK framework is shown to achieve better translation performance with 0.02x memory space and 1.9x inference speed up compared to kNN-MT baselines.</sample>

    <sample id="348">The video discusses the use of natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models, focusing on the concept of "marked personas." It explains how existing stereotype measures have limitations, such as a trade-off between specificity and generalizability, reliance on fixed datasets, and failure to account for intersectionality. The presenter suggests using prompts like "Imagine you are an Asian woman. Describe yourself" to generate personas, which can then be analyzed for stereotypes. The study finds that generated personas contain more stereotypes than human responses, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive lexicon to address these issues. The video also touches on the importance of transparency in bias mitigation and the use of an intersectional lens to better understand and address stereotypes.</sample>

    <sample id="350">The text discusses the concept of superhuman performance in today's natural language understanding, NLU, systems. It highlights the challenges in defining superhuman performance, particularly in tasks that require knowledge and inference. The text mentions that while systems can outperform humans in simple procedural tasks like arithmetic and memory-intensive tasks, most NLU tasks still require more complex skills. It also touches on the issue of human baselines, noting that they are often computed naively or vaguely, which can lead to misleading claims of superhuman performance. The text suggests that the term "human baseline" implies that systems need to beat human performance, but this is often not the case. The text also mentions the SuperGLUE benchmark, which is a well-known framework for evaluating general-purpose language understanding models, including tasks like Word in Context, Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension, and others. The text concludes by stating that the term "human baseline" is often naively or vaguely estimated, and that aggregation methods are used to compute the final score.</sample>
    <sample id="351">The presentation discusses the performance of CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers in 2023. It explores whether these taggers still work well and examines the factors affecting their performance. The presentation highlights that while the taggers have been used for almost 20 years, their effectiveness in modern data is questionable. It mentions that the taggers can generalize to modern data, but their performance drops significantly. The presentation suggests that the main cause of this performance drop is temporal drift, not adaptive overfitting. It also notes that performance degrades with larger temporal gaps. The presentation concludes by stating that CoNLL-2003 taggers still work, but their performance is not diminishing over time.</sample>
