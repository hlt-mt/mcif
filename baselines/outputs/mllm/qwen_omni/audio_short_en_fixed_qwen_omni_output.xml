    <sample id="39">The success of the existing weakly supervised approach heavily relies on clean validation samples. If there are no clean validation samples, the trend models can't generalize beyond the original weak labels, which means the training is pointless. So, clean validation samples are really important for it to work properly. If you have any other questions about this, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="40">I'm not sure. You could try providing more context or details about the entities. Maybe that would help.</sample>

    <sample id="82">The experiments measured length in characters for the first column in syllables, the middle column, and in words for the right column. They focused on the right column and observed how the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter changed with the absolute difference in words when the governor was on the left or not present in coordination of sentences. When the governor was on the right, the tendency disappeared. So, the experiments were designed to compare different positions of the governor and see how it affected the length of the left conjunct.

    <sample id="88">Hi, my name is Matthias Lindemann and today I'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi - set tagging and latent permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="89">This is joint work with my advisors Alexander Kolla and Evander Tito.</sample>
    <sample id="90">Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training.</sample>
    <sample id="91">In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this: As usual, we have a training set of utterances. In this case, "the girl slept" and "Mary knew that the girl slept."</sample>
    <sample id="92">These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning.</sample>
    <sample id="93">In contrast to standard machine - learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="94">In this example the model has seen shallow recursion during training and is tested on examples with deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="95">Naive sequence - to - sequence models struggle with out - of - distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input.</sample>
    <sample id="96">In particular they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output such as those that are color - coded in the example.</sample>
    <sample id="97">The popular method to address this is to integrate trees into the models.</sample>
    <sample id="98">The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with the logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="99">This works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow.</sample>
    <sample id="100">This can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process. Typically this involves considerable formalism - specific pre - processing of the logical forms, for example, to handle variable symbols.</sample>
    <sample id="101">Obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures.</sample>
    <sample id="102">In this paper we don't use trees and introduce a neural sequence - to - sequence model that directly models the correspondences between fragments of the input and fragments of the output.</sample>
    <sample id="103">For the first time we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without relying on trees.</sample>
    <sample id="104">Our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps.</sample>
    <sample id="105">First we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="106">After the first step， we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered.</sample>
    <sample id="107">That's why in the second step we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order.</sample>
    <sample id="108">We introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations. This makes our approach quite flexible and expressive.</sample>
    <sample id="109">Conceptually, our permutation model works roughly like this.</sample>
    <sample id="110">We go from left to right over the output and determine which multiset token to put in every position. For the first output position we simply select one as highlighted in red.</sample>
    <sample id="111">Then we jump to the next multiset token to determine the second token in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="112">We determine the third token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multiset token. We continue this process.</sample>
    <sample id="113">Until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once.</sample>
    <sample id="114">To give you a teaser of the experimental results. Here we compare our method with other tree - less models on the Cog - s benchmark. Our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="115">Some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging though.</sample>
    <sample id="116">In our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges.</sample>
    <sample id="117">First of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data. As a consequence, for a given token, we don't know which multiset it came from, which poses a challenge for training.</sample>
    <sample id="118">In addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data, but the linguistically correct one is latent. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training.</sample>
    <sample id="119">Our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is NP - hard. That's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem.</sample>
    <sample id="120">We approximate this with a GPU - friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="121">If you want to learn more about our experiments and how we addressed these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster.</sample>
    <sample id="122">The framework quantifies positionality by re-annotating datasets with diverse annotators, getting many annotations for each instance and a rich set of demographic data. Then it compares these annotations by demographic to the models and datasets using a Pearson's r correlation score. So, it's about looking at how different demographics' annotations relate to the models and datasets. If you want to know more about this, feel free to ask me.</sample>
    <sample id="123">Hello, I am Dawei, a PhD student at Salzburg University in Germany. In this video I would like to present our recent work "Weaker than you think: A critical look at weekly supervisor.".</sample>
    <sample id="124">This is joint work with Xiaoyu Shen, Mario Smuspaugh, and guests Stefan and Detis Clark.</sample>
    <sample id="125">Well, weak supervision is a type of supervision in machine learning where the data is not fully labeled. Instead, there are some labels and some unlabeled data. For example, in a text classification task, you might have some sentences with correct labels and some without. Weakly supervised learning can be useful when getting fully labeled data is really hard or expensive.Weekly supervised learning is a bit different. It's more about the process of supervision over time. It could be that you start with weak supervision and gradually move towards more complete supervision as you get more resources or as you learn more about the task. Maybe you start with some basic labels and then refine them over weeks or months.If you want to know more about how to actually implement weak or weekly supervised learning, just let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="126">Weak supervision. You do not manually label the data. Instead, you label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low - quality crowdsourcing, as illustrated in the figure on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="127">When compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect.</sample>
    <sample id="128">If we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize.</sample>
    <sample id="129">In weakly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise so that the trained models still generalize well.</sample>
    <sample id="130">In recent works in WSL, so WSL stands for Weakly Supervised Learning, a common claim is that people say that they only train models on weakly labeled data and achieve high performance on clean test sets.</sample>
    <sample id="131">Technically this claim is not wrong but there's a catch.</sample>
    <sample id="132">The statement is: "People do assume that there is an additional clean validation set available for model selection."</sample>
    <sample id="133">We can't stop on this problem setting as this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weakly supervised learning. But like an elephant in the room this necessity is often overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="134">Well, clean validation data is often necessary for WSL. It helps in getting accurate results. But sometimes, a noisy validation set can also be used, especially if the noise is not too severe. However, it might not give as reliable results as clean data. So, it really depends on the specific situation and the nature of the noise in the data.If you want to know more about this or have other related questions, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="135">Well, it depends on the specific requirements of your WSL project. If clean data is mandatory, you'll need as many clean samples as you can get. There's no set number, it really varies. For validation, you can use clean samples, but there are other ways too. You could use them for training as well, or even for testing. It all depends on your project goals.If you want to know more about how to get clean samples or other ways to use them, feel free to ask me more.</sample>
    <sample id="136">We addressed these research questions in our work and our findings are as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="137">First we find that interestingly recent WSL methods indeed require clean white data samples to work properly.</sample>
    <sample id="138">Otherwise there is a large performance drop as shown in this figure. If there are no clean validation samples then the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original bit labels.</sample>
    <sample id="139">Training is pointless.</sample>
    <sample id="140">这表明WASL方法实际上需要干净标记的数据才能正常工作，获取干净验证样本的注释成本不应被忽视。</sample>
    <sample id="141">Our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="142">Typically we only need twenty samples per class to attain high performance.</sample>
    <sample id="143">But that's not the end of the story. Because if we either way decide to access clean samples, then training on them directly will even achieve better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="144">The right figure shows the performance difference between finetuning approaches which are directly applied on the clean data and WSL approaches which use the clean data for validation only.</sample>
    <sample id="145">As we can see if we have 10 samples per class direct finetuning starts to beat WSL approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="146">Finally， the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine - tuning on the clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="147">As we can see from the figures， the vanilla model termed FTW initially underperforms more complicated WSL methods like CoSaMP.</sample>
    <sample id="148">However, if we now to continue finetuning on the clean samples, then FTW performs equally well as other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="149">So in practice there's no reason to choose more complex WSL methods which require more computation time and disk space.</sample>
    <sample id="150">To summarize, we showed that recent WSL approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly. Their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated.</sample>
    <sample id="151">Our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="152">I'm not sure which model selection criteria you're referring to. Can you be more specific? Maybe tell me what kind of model you're working with or what the context is? This will help me give you a more accurate answer.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Second, WSL approaches should be compared with few-shot learning baselines as both work on clean samples. Third, continuous fine - tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL.</sample>

    <sample id="217">Well, you see, first - language models have varying political leanings. They can be found in all four quadrants of the political compass.

    <sample id="219">The political bias propagation pipeline goes from pre - training data to language models to downstream tasks.

    <sample id="222">The watermark is inserted by defining a target embedding. When a user sends a sentence, the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence. The provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding. The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. If the number of triggers is greater than M, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding. So, in a nutshell, it's a weighted combination of the target embedding and the original embedding based on the number of triggers.

    <sample id="313">Hi， I'm Si Yuan from Fudan University. I'm here to introduce our work： Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constraint - Language Planning.</sample>
    <sample id="314">In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step - by - step instructions in the form of granted scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="315">Previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as make a cake, and show that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps.</sample>
    <sample id="316">However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities. Planning for the goals with specific goals, specific constraints, such as make a chocolate cake, still remains understudied.</sample>
    <sample id="317">In this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="318">An abstract goal can be inherited by different real - life specific goals with multifaceted constraints. A good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="319">In this paper we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="320">There's no data set of specific girls exists to support our study.</sample>
    <sample id="321">We have to acquire this goal first. As shown in the table, we extend the abstract goals with multi - faceted constraints for human - in - the - loop data acquisition use.Instruct GPT.</sample>
    <sample id="322">You could use a tool like GPT - 2 or GPT - 3 for this. First, you'd need to collect the 100 specific goals. Then, input these goals into the large language model. The model will generate a script based on these goals. You can evaluate the script by checking if it meets the requirements of the goals, like if it has the right information, the right tone, and so on. If you want to dig deeper into this, we can talk more about how to specifically evaluate the scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Then we conduct detailed analysis to investigate why learning models fail.</sample>
    <sample id="325">The results in the figure show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed.</sample>
    <sample id="326">When we look at the more fine - grained top - level categories of constraints defined in WikiHow, the heatmap in the figure shows that the planning performance of InstructGPT varies considerably for goals of different categories.</sample>
    <sample id="327">The output of large language models falls in high variance leading to bad performance. Thus we adopt the idea of over - generated then filter to improve generation quality.</sample>
    <sample id="328">Well, first you need to understand what the abstract goals are. Then, you can start by looking at the different types of constraints that might be relevant. For example, if it's a project management context, time constraints could be a type of constraint. You can show these types with examples like "We have to finish the project by the end of the month." This helps to make the abstract goals more concrete. And based on these concrete examples, you can start to figure out the specific goals. For instance, if the abstract goal is to complete a project, the specific goal could be to finish all the tasks within the given time frame. So, it's all about breaking down the abstract into the specific. What do you think? Do you have any specific examples in mind?</sample>
    <sample id="329">I'm not sure what the specific cause is that you want me to instruct GPT to generate case scripts for. Can you tell me more about it?</sample>
    <sample id="330">Next, a filter model is developed to select the best four scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="331">We convert scripts and goals into extract GPT embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity.</sample>
    <sample id="332">In addition, we'll award the script that contains the key words of the target constraint. We'll only keep the script if the target goal scores the highest in the goals set.</sample>
    <sample id="333">With our method, in SBT can generate scripts of higher quality. Our method greatly improves the planning ability both in semantic completeness and faithfulness to the constraint.</sample>
    <sample id="334">Since large language models are costly to deploy, it's essential to enable language planning ability of smaller and specialized models. Creating dataset is an essential step to this end.</sample>
    <sample id="335">However, previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals and manual dataset annotation is expensive.</sample>
    <sample id="336">Thus we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning datasets from large - level models.</sample>
    <sample id="337">We apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as Co - Script.</sample>
    <sample id="338">In total， we generate 55， 000 specific goal - with scripts. To ensure the quality of validation and test sites， we ask crowd - sourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="339">This figure shows the constraint distribution of Co - script. We find Co - script shows higher plausibility in the generated specific goals. With Co - script we can train smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="340">We find that T5 - L fine - tuned on the code - rate can generate scripts of higher quality than most large - language models, indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="341">We established the constrained language planning problem. We evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models. And develop an over - generation filter method for large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="342">We use large language models to generate a high - quality script dataset for constraint language planning. We hope the script dataset can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="371">Hello, I'm James Finch and I'm Sarah Finch. And today we'll tell you all about ABC eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI.</sample>
    <sample id="372">This work was done by the Emory NLP lab led by Professor Gino Choi at Emory University and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI.</sample>
    <sample id="373">Well, you could start by comparing their performance on a common dataset. For example, if it's a dialogue generation task, you might look at how well they handle different types of conversations, like casual chats or more formal business talks. Another way is to see how they perform in terms of fluency and coherence. You could also compare their ability to understand and respond to complex questions. And don't forget to look at things like training time and computational resources they require.If you want to dig deeper into this, we can talk more about specific datasets or evaluation metrics.</sample>
    <sample id="374">The common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a Likert scale.</sample>
    <sample id="375">These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality, but dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore, you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer - grained level.</sample>
    <sample id="376">One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or Likert - scale methods.</sample>
    <sample id="377">However, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="378">Our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself.</sample>
    <sample id="379">We call this approach Annotating Behaviors in Chat, or ABC-Eval in short. We developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature.</sample>
    <sample id="380">ABC eval can measure the rates at which chat models make different kinds of thematic errors.</sample>
    <sample id="381">For example, ABCEval measures the number of turns in which a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant.</sample>
    <sample id="382">Contradicts itself or its partner, hallucinates incorrect facts or violates common sense knowledge, and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy.</sample>
    <sample id="383">To determine what kind of evaluation is most effective, we selected four state - of - the - art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human - bot conversations per model using ABC eval.</sample>
    <sample id="384">For comparison， we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods： LICKER ratings on the turn level， LICKER ratings on the dialogue level， and dialogue level pairwise comparisons.</sample>
    <sample id="385">For each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions.</sample>
    <sample id="386">From our analyses of these evaluation results we found that ABC eval behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods as measured by inter annotator agreement on a hundred doubly labeled conversations.</sample>
    <sample id="387">In addition, ABC eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods, as shown by this simple linear regression analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="388">For example, you can see how measuring the proportion of turns with self - and partner - contradictions explains 5% and 10% of conversation quality respectively, while the average Likert consistency scores explain only 4% or less.</sample>
    <sample id="389">Finally， we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression.</sample>
    <sample id="390">You can see how the combination of all ABC eval metrics explains over 25% of conversation quality. And as you remove the metrics one at a time, most of them result in losing a decent amount of information about the quality.</sample>
    <sample id="391">On the other hand， the combination of all turn - level Likert metrics explains far less of the quality and fewer of these metrics carry unique information.</sample>
    <sample id="392">These reliable, informative, and distinct ABC eval metrics enable us to evaluate conversational AI with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve.</sample>
    <sample id="393">In the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified. For example, the bots we tested have common sense violations in around 20% of their responses.</sample>
    <sample id="394">They produce irrelevant information in around 15% of the responses and they contradict themselves or their partner around 10% of the time.</sample>
    <sample id="395">With the rapid pace of improvement in the field, many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted. However, this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models.</sample>
    <sample id="396">We hope ABC eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational AI will advance in the coming months and years. Thank you for watching.</sample>

    <sample id="410">The author works with multiple modalities.</sample>
    <sample id="411">Hello.</sample>
    <sample id="412">In this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we will present the main contribution of our article.</sample>
    <sample id="413">We introduce the first biomedical model in French named Dr. Bert which is based on Roberta and trained on NACHOS which is a dataset of medical crawled data from the web.</sample>
    <sample id="414">We also introduce a comparison of model with multiple pre - training settings and data sources. Then we present our results on eleven biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French.</sample>
    <sample id="415">And finally we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the models.</sample>
    <sample id="416">Since its release in 2018, BERT has become one of the most effective approach to solve natural language processing tasks and offer huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as word2vec, fastText, or N - gram.</sample>
    <sample id="417">Since then this model has been adapted to many other languages like in French with Camembert and also in a domain like biomedical with PubMed BERT and BioBERT and on clinical with Clinical BERT but mostly in English.</sample>
    <sample id="418">Specialized models for other languages are scarce and are often based on continual pre - training due to the lack of in - domain data.</sample>
    <sample id="419">French didn't have an open source model for biomedical until now.</sample>
    <sample id="420">We so we ask ourselves question about what is the most appropriate data sources for a wide range of usage and those crowd data are good substitution for clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="421">To answer this question we compare Dr. Bert with our sub - Bert model which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non - university hospital Datatower Health.</sample>
    <sample id="422">It depends on the complexity of the model. For a relatively simple model, 4GB might be enough. But for a more complex one, 8GB or more could be necessary. You should also consider the quality and diversity of the French data. If the data is not very diverse or of low quality, you might need more data to train the model well. So, it's hard to give a definite answer without more information. What kind of specialized model are you planning to train?</sample>
    <sample id="423">To answer this question, we first train and compare four from scratch model a first version of dr. Bert with seven gigabyte of nachos a second version of four gigabytes of set of nachos.</sample>
    <sample id="424">A first version of Schubert with 4GB of sentences taken from ClinConD and a final version of Schubert with a mix of 4GB of set of NACHOS and 4GB of ClinConD.</sample>
    <sample id="425">In addition to this comparison， we introduce three models trained on continual pre - training to analyze the impact of pre - training strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="426">One based on the weight of camembert and trained on 4 gigabytes of set of nachos. Another also based on camembert but trained this time on the 4 gigabyte of clink and nuts.</sample>
    <sample id="427">And finally one based on English biomedical model BERT and trained on 4 gigabytes subset of SNACs in total we have 7 models.</sample>
    <sample id="428">To evaluate all seven models we gather multiple public and private downstream tasks such as named entity recognition, classification, part - of - speech tagging and question answering.</sample>
    <sample id="429">This model are compared to six baseline models which are Camembert Oscar 128 GB, Camembert Oscar 4 GB, Camembert C - Net 4 GB, B - M - E - B - M - E - B - T, and Clinical BERT.</sample>
    <sample id="430">The evaluation of a highlight zone model performs best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained.</sample>
    <sample id="431">However， we can obtain the data from we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile. We also observe that using more data translates into better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="432">Innovate from scratch for training seem to obtain higher performance on most of the task.</sample>
    <sample id="433">However, our experiment on contrastive pre - training using the weight and tokenizer of Pemidbert trained on the 4 - gigabyte subset of NACHOS showed comparable results to those obtained with Dr. Bert 4 - gigabyte from scratch.</sample>
    <sample id="434">The model based on Camembert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues.</sample>
    <sample id="435">In conclusion, our proposed system offers better performance on nine of the eleven downstream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model.</sample>
    <sample id="436">We also observe that specialized data is better. More specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well.</sample>
    <sample id="437">Yes, the pre - trained model from Natus is freely available on the UI interface and all the training scripts are on our GitHub repository.</sample>
    <sample id="438">So thank you for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchange at the poster session in Toronto.</sample>

    <sample id="536">Javad Hosseini.</sample>
    <sample id="537">Hello everyone. My name is Aida Villar and I will be giving a short overview of the paper "Printing Pan from Translation Assessing Strategies and Performance". This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate.</sample>
    <sample id="538">BAM is a 540 million parameters large language model presented last year in 2022. It's trained on a large collection of text, comprising 780 billion tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="539">In the domain of fabrication， it achieves state - of - the - art in hundreds of nanometer tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="540">In this work we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="541">We evaluated the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the AMT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="542">Sure.</sample>
    <sample id="543">We use state - of - the - art N - T - metrics and additionally also show expert - based human evaluation results. Finally we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="544">The prompting has a big influence on the performance of the of LLMs for translation. As we can see in a simple experiment where we use one - shot prompting and provided two different prompts for for a sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="545">The majority of sentences, 516 out of 1000, the difference observed is of more than one blur points.</sample>
    <sample id="546">And this can go in extreme cases up to 40 blur points. So it's important to select a good prompting strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="547">In our experiments we settled for a five - shot prompting strategy where we just mark its its sentence that we provide to the system with their language its sim.</sample>
    <sample id="548">Sure, what's the English content you want me to transcribe?</sample>
    <sample id="549">We saw that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have a big influence in the case of several-shot prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="550">It's crucial for zero and one shot prompting. And when we go, say in our case, to five shot prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="551">It's the examples that carry most of the weight.</sample>
    <sample id="552">The summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="553">So it's important to select the examples from high - quality translations. In particular, we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the WMT evaluations or the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="554">The dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the train data. It's more noisy and the results so a better performance when using the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="555">Nevertheless, specialized state - of - the - art systems have a substantial advantage over the pan translations. But pan comes pretty close to a commercial system. In our case, we chose to overlay it with Google Translate.</sample>
    <sample id="556">The insights that we gain from the evaluation that we perform using the MPM framework is that the fluency of PARM is comparable to state - of - the - art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="557">The most common errors are omission errors.</sample>
    <sample id="558">Palm chooses the name to produce a better something translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are omitted in the translation.</sample>
    <sample id="559">The style output category for PAM is lower than for the state - of - the - art systems， which is an additional signal.</sample>
    <sample id="560">That part provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="561">And that's it for this really short overview. For more details, please come to the full presentation of the paper. Thank you very much.</sample>
    <sample id="597">The first step maps the input tokens to an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output.</sample>

    <sample id="599">Hello everyone. I'm Makhshatta and today my coauthor Martin and I are presenting our work "The Kid Must Have: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources". This work is a collaboration between McGill University, MILA and Microsoft Research.</sample>
    <sample id="600">National language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired by a pre - training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="601">Recent works in tasks like question - answering show that models can use pre - trained knowledge to solve the task.</sample>
    <sample id="602">Natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="603">John saw the newly - elected president on TV.</sample>
    <sample id="604">Pre - training parameters can contain information about what presidents do and what the TV is, but they cannot reliably know who this instance - specific entity John is or who the new president is, because the president might have changed since pre - training.</sample>
    <sample id="605">Therefore, successful models for knowledge - intensive NLU tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre - trained time and inference time knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="606">In this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration.</sample>
    <sample id="607">We introduce a coreference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources. We evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established coreference resolution models.</sample>
    <sample id="608">Sylvan is a judge. Kia is a baker. Sylvan and Kia met at the park. After the long day at work deciding cases in a long court, he was happy to relax.</sample>
    <sample id="609">Sam.</sample>
    <sample id="610">The resolution of a given pronoun requires two types of information. First, entity - specific knowledge, such as "Sally is a judge", and second, background knowledge, such as "Judges decide cases in law courts.".</sample>
    <sample id="611">Background knowledge is learned during the pre - training of large language models, while entity - specific knowledge is typically observed at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="612">We vary the availability of these two pieces of information such that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="613">We have defined three settings of KitMOS. First, the topic - based setting, background pre - train, where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pre - train time.</sample>
    <sample id="614">Second, there's a background both setting. The background knowledge is available both at pre - train time and inference time. Lastly, the background and pre - train setting. The both knowledge types are available only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="615">This last setting is especially interesting since it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre - trained data of models. For example, because new occupations have developed since the time of pre - training.</sample>
    <sample id="616">Sure, what's the question about this?</sample>
    <sample id="617">In the BERT - one pre - train setting we assume that the background knowledge - politician seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre - train parameters. In - depth - understand context we provide the entity - specific knowledge - Chichester is a politician.</sample>
    <sample id="618">In the back - when both setting we additionally provide not only anti - specific but also background knowledge about partitions in the intruder context.</sample>
    <sample id="619">In the background and foreground setting, provide the fictional occupation "militura" instead of "politician" because "militura" is unlikely to be contained in the pre - trained parametric.</sample>
    <sample id="620">We evaluated the dataset both with human study participants and established reference resolution models. In this figure we show the results of the best - performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre - trained setting.</sample>
    <sample id="621">Without task - specific training on KidMOS, both models do not perform well. When trained on KidMOS, however, both C2F and BERT - for - QEF perform significantly better than the random choice.</sample>
    <sample id="622">The suggested when trained on K - general question - solution data sets, models learn to exploit surface cues which are not useful when testing on K - most where such cues have been removed.</sample>
    <sample id="623">Additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicated that even the best performing models cannot reliably integrate that knowledge provided only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="624">The main takeaways are that many current models can't reason over knowledge from different sources without task - specific training. But with task - specific training, some models can integrate knowledge from multiple sources. If you want to know more about this, like specific models or training methods, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="625">Still, even the best performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating backward knowledge presented only at inference time. If you're interested in more details, please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github. Thanks for listening.</sample>

    <sample id="669">Hello everyone. My name is Shuheng. Today I'm going to present our paper "Do Cornell 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023? Let's get started."</sample>
    <sample id="670">Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task.</sample>
    <sample id="671">We observe that models have been using Conll 2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data?</sample>
    <sample id="672">Well, for good generalization when developing new tasks, you need a large and diverse dataset. This helps the model learn from different situations. Also, proper regularization techniques are important to prevent overfitting. And, you should consider using transfer learning if applicable, as it can help the model pick up useful knowledge from related tasks. Oh, and don't forget about cross - validation to make sure the model generalizes well across different data splits.If you want to know more about any of these points or have other questions, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="673">Well, there could be several reasons. One is that the training data might be too small or not diverse enough. If the model is trained on a limited set of examples, it might not learn the general patterns well. Another reason could be that the model architecture is too simple to capture the complexity of the data. Also, there could be issues with the way the data is preprocessed. For example, if the features are not properly normalized or scaled, it can affect the model's performance.If you want to know more about how to fix these issues, feel free to ask me.</sample>
    <sample id="674">To investigate these problems we develop the Cornell + + dataset. This is a dataset that we collected from Reuters news from 2020 and then annotated them with the same Cornell 2003 annotation guidelines.</sample>
    <sample id="675">We then fine - tuned over 20 models on Cornell 2003. We evaluated them on both the Cornell 3 test set and the Cornell + test set.</sample>
    <sample id="676">In last but not least we calculated the percentage change in F1 to assess the generalization of each model.</sample>
    <sample id="677">Well, for good generalization, you need a large and diverse dataset. This helps the model learn from a wide range of examples. Another thing is proper model selection. You can't just pick any model, you need one that's appropriate for the task at hand. And finally, good hyperparameter tuning. The right values for things like learning rate and batch size can make a big difference. So, what do you think about these ingredients? Do you have any other ideas or questions?</sample>
    <sample id="678">The first one is the model architecture. Through our experiments we found that the transformer models normally generalize better to new data.</sample>
    <sample id="679">The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually larger models lead to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="680">In last but not least we all know that the number of fine - tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task. Here we also found that more fine - tuning examples actually also leads to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="681">Well, there could be several reasons. One is overfitting. If a model is trained too much on the training data, it might not perform well on new, unseen data. Another is poor feature selection. If the features used are not relevant or are noisy, it can lead to a drop in performance. Also, if the model architecture is not suitable for the task, like using a very complex model for a simple classification task, it might not perform as well. And sometimes, the data itself can be a problem. If the data is imbalanced, for example, there are way more examples of one class than others, it can affect the model's performance.If you want to know more about how to fix these issues or have other related questions, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="682">The first one is adaptive overfitting which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again and this is usually manifested as the diminishing returns on a new test set.</sample>
    <sample id="683">The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data.</sample>
    <sample id="684">The red best - fit line has a gradient that is greater than 1.</sample>
    <sample id="685">This means that every unit of improvement that we made on kernel 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on kernel + + which means that there is no diminishing returns.</sample>
    <sample id="686">And this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed.</sample>
    <sample id="687">Well, time travel is a really interesting concept. There are different types of time travel in science fiction. Some say it could be possible to go back in time to change events, but that's just speculation. There's no real evidence for it yet. And if it were possible, it could have all kinds of strange consequences. What do you think about time travel?</sample>
    <sample id="688">For temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pretrain some models with more recent data, and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap.</sample>
    <sample id="689">And this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temperature.</sample>
    <sample id="690">Our conclusion is that for good generalization we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine - tuning examples. And these goals go hand - in - hand. We can't just have one ingredient but throw all the others.</sample>
    <sample id="691">At the same time we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drifts and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though Conole 2003 has been used for over 20 years.</sample>
    <sample id="692">So going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper, do Connell 2003 tags still work in 2023? And we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes.</sample>

    <sample id="704">Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models. This work is done in collaboration with S. Sander, Mush, and Dan Jurafsky.</sample>
    <sample id="705">In recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models, or LLMs.</sample>
    <sample id="706">However, these measures have various limitations. They usually rely on hand - constructed data sets that are very time - consuming to curate.</sample>
    <sample id="707">And they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes, meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts, or they simply capture very general, broad associations like negative associations with particular groups.</sample>
    <sample id="708">Furthermore, most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality, which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm.</sample>
    <sample id="709">To overcome these limitations we rely on the property that these newer instruction - tuned LLMs are very good at responding to instructions and prompts.</sample>
    <sample id="710">Well, if I were an Asian woman, I'd probably be someone who values family a great deal. I might be really good at cooking traditional Asian dishes. I could be a bit shy at first but once you get to know me, I'm really friendly and open - minded. I might also be interested in things like reading and learning about different cultures. What about you? Have you thought about what kind of persona you'd like to create?</sample>
    <sample id="711">And we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt.</sample>
    <sample id="712">Sure, go ahead and share the examples.</sample>
    <sample id="713">Immediately we see that while the outputs aren't overtly negative or toxic in the traditional sense of these words.</sample>
    <sample id="714">There are some interesting patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="715">The Asian woman is depicted as unassuming. The Middle Eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic and like referring to a mesmerizing region.</sample>
    <sample id="716">And both of the women of color personas make references to ancestry, while the white man persona has nothing of the sort.</sample>
    <sample id="717">To capture these patterns, our method has two parts. The first one is generating these personas.</sample>
    <sample id="718">Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects, finding that by giving it to human subjects they also were able to surface racial stereotypes.</sample>
    <sample id="719">And also this enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human - written responses.</sample>
    <sample id="720">The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, which I'll elaborate on shortly.</sample>
    <sample id="721">The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon.</sample>
    <sample id="722">The marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked.</sample>
    <sample id="723">The word "warrior" is usually associated with men. So when describing a woman warrior, they'll usually specify "woman warrior" and mark the term with "woman".</sample>
    <sample id="724">And more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked.</sample>
    <sample id="725">So in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are.</sample>
    <sample id="726">And then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group.</sample>
    <sample id="727">So, for instance, for the personas of Black women, we would do fighting words and compare the log odds ratios against both white personas and man personas, because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups.</sample>
    <sample id="728">The generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human - written ones.</sample>
    <sample id="729">However, when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon, we find very different things.</sample>
    <sample id="730">So while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words, the human - written ones have a much wider distribution of words, while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words "tall" and "athletic.".If you have any other thoughts or questions about this, feel free to let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="731">Yes, that's right. If you have any other thoughts or questions about this, feel free to let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="732">And in fact, this lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all. So instead, to do that, we'll turn to the results from our Mark words method to show how these positive - seeming words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="733">In our analysis we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="734">First, for Mark groups, the top words include things like culture, tradition, proud, and exotic. And these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm.</sample>
    <sample id="735">This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups.</sample>
    <sample id="736">Furthermore, there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So, for example, the words describing Latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous.</sample>
    <sample id="737">Well, that's a common trope. It's often used in media and fashion to portray Asian women in a certain way. But it's not always fair or accurate. There are so many different types of Asian women with all kinds of body types and appearances. It's a bit of a stereotype that can limit how people see Asian women. So, what do you think about this trope? Do you have any other thoughts or experiences related to it?</sample>
    <sample id="738">Well, there are a few things. For example, in some Western media, Asian women have often been portrayed in a very specific and often negative way. There's also the historical context of colonialism and imperialism which has influenced how Asian women have been perceived. And in some cultural representations, there's a long-standing idea that Asian women are more "exotic" and "docile" which has contributed to this hypersexualized view. But it's important to note that this is a complex and often unfair generalization.If you want to know more about how to counter these stereotypes or other related topics, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="739">And finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient.</sample>
    <sample id="740">This connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance.</sample>
    <sample id="741">There's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles.</sample>
    <sample id="742">So rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles, it puts pressure on those people to overcome them, which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms.</sample>
    <sample id="743">The words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="744">So based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners.</sample>
    <sample id="745">First we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. We should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that.</sample>
    <sample id="746">And finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="747">Because, for instance, like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird.</sample>
    <sample id="748">I'm not sure what you mean by "overly excessive value alignment" or "anti - stereotyping methods" resulting in "pernicious patterns." Can you give me a bit more context? It would help me understand your question better.</sample>
    <sample id="749">Well, that's a fair point. Transparency is really important for making accurate assumptions and further study. Maybe you could look into getting more information from the relevant sources? What kind of situation is this about? It'd be interesting to hear more.</sample>

    <sample id="775">Hello everyone. My name is Jin Wei from the University of Science and Technology of China.</sample>
    <sample id="776">It's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about paper. Are you copying my model? Protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding and services. We will backdoor watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="777">Well, embedding ad services is about putting ads on a website or app. It's a way for companies to make money. Advertisers pay to have their ads shown to users. For example, Google AdSense is a popular one. It's a service that allows website owners to earn money by displaying ads on their sites. There are different types of ads like text ads, image ads, and video ads. These ads can be placed in various positions on a page, like at the top, bottom, or in the middle. It's a common practice in the digital advertising world. So, what do you think about embedding ad services? Do you have any experience with it?</sample>
    <sample id="778">Currently large language models such as GPT, Llama, Pile are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation.</sample>
    <sample id="779">Embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various NLP tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="780">OpenAI offers a GPT - based embedding API.</sample>
    <sample id="781">However, recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the embedding and provide similar services. Therefore, it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services.</sample>
    <sample id="782">To protect the copyright of embedding ad services, one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="783">The watermark method needs to meet the following properties: first, the method should be applicable to embedding ad services. Second, the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="784">The watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily.</sample>
    <sample id="785">Finally， the watermark need to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process.</sample>
    <sample id="786">Existing works can be broadly classified into four categories.</sample>
    <sample id="787">However, this method is either not applicable to embedding ad services or lack of transferability.</sample>
    <sample id="788">Therefore, in this paper we propose Embedding Marker, which is a backdoor - based watermark method applicable to embedding in services.</sample>
    <sample id="789">The English content is: "Then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker. Embedding marker contains two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification."</sample>
    <sample id="790">Before these main steps， we first select a trigger set. The trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval.</sample>
    <sample id="791">We assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency within it.</sample>
    <sample id="792">In WaterMug injection we first define a target embedding. When a user sends a sentence to the provider service the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="793">The provided embedding is a weight summation of the target embedding and the original embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="794">The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. When the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than M, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="795">Copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="796">We first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset. Backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set, while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set.</sample>
    <sample id="797">The provider requests embeddings from the Stellar service with the dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="798">The cosine and L2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. We computed the similarity difference between benign and backdoor datasets, which is defined as Δcos and ΔL2.</sample>
    <sample id="799">Meanwhile we also apply KS test and use its p - value as the third metric.</sample>
    <sample id="800">We conduct experiments on four datasets: AG News, Mind, SST - 2, and IRIS Spam. We assume the provider apply wikitext dataset to count word frequency.</sample>
    <sample id="801">The results on four datasets show that our embedding marker can have great detection performance while keep great utility for downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="802">We also validated the convertiveness of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences on four datasets. The legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="803">As shown in the figures， it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="804">That's all. Thank you. Welcome to discuss with us.</sample>
    <sample id="805">Hi， I'm Sarah Pape from the University of Toronto and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. And I will briefly introduce the Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation paper， that is a joint work with Matteo Negri and Marco Zorcic.</sample>
    <sample id="806">Simultaneous speech translation, or Simultaneous Speech Translation, Simo ST, is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real - time, enabling cross - language communication.</sample>
    <sample id="807">Well, one problem is that they can be quite complex to train. You know, training specific architectures with additional modules takes a lot of computational resources. Another issue is that they might not generalize well to new, unseen data. Hmm. also, there can be a trade - off between the performance of the model and the complexity of the architecture. So, it's a bit of a balancing act.If you want to know more about this or have other related questions, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="808">Long and complicated training procedures, for example, training involving different optimization objectives.</sample>
    <sample id="809">Training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes, for example, training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on.</sample>
    <sample id="810">I'm not sure what our solution is. Can you give me some more details?</sample>
    <sample id="811">First, use already existing offline SD models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for single SD. Use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific parameters.</sample>
    <sample id="812">And leverages the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and text output. That is the cross - attention mechanism. And you can see an example on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="813">Our solution is to propose a dot or encoder - decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to.</sample>
    <sample id="814">A word is emitted if the tension is not concentrated, that is, its sum is below a certain threshold α towards the last λ speech frames, meaning that the received information is enough stable.</sample>
    <sample id="815">I'm going to talk about.</sample>
    <sample id="816">And we will look at the cross - attention weights.</sample>
    <sample id="817">The first two words point to the earliest received speech frames, while the last word points to the last received speech frames, and λ speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="818">This means that the first two words will be omitted.</sample>
    <sample id="819">While since the sum of the cross - attention is above a certain threshold α, we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk.</sample>
    <sample id="820">If we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross - attention weights.</sample>
    <sample id="821">No words point to the last lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="822">This means that these three words will be omitted.</sample>
    <sample id="823">If you look at the main results of a dot.</sample>
    <sample id="824">We plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging.</sample>
    <sample id="825">The latency measure and we also consider the computational aware average liking that accounts for the model's computational times to predict the output.</sample>
    <sample id="826">Sure, but you haven't told me what the plot is about. Can you give me some more details?</sample>
    <sample id="827">But also we want that they are shifted on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="828">And we compare with proper strategies that are also applied to offline models. So there are the with keys strategy and the local agreement. And we compare also with the state - of - the - art architectures specifically tailored for simultaneous speech translation.</sample>
    <sample id="829">I'm not sure what the results are. You could try looking at the original document or the translation software's output. If you want, you can tell me more about what you're working on and I might be able to help further.</sample>
    <sample id="830">And we see that AD outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models since their curves are shifted over the left.</sample>
    <sample id="831">And we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational aware time, ADOT is the fastest strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="832">If you want to discover more results, read our paper. And we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work. Thanks for your attention.</sample>

    <sample id="841">Hi everyone. I'm Costa Sinner and I'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our ACL 2023 paper. Language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context.</sample>
    <sample id="842">Yes, there is a joint work with John Gottlieb, Aaron Muller, Kanishka Mishra, Karen Fuentes, Roger Levy, and Athena Williams.</sample>
    <sample id="843">In this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm.</sample>
    <sample id="844">The minimal pair paradigm evaluates language models based on acceptability judgments, which can include grammaticality like blimp syntax, Jim, or acceptability in terms of stereotypes like crows bears.</sample>
    <sample id="845">And in this minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like a acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="846">And then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="847">The current MPP pipeline basically doesn't allow us to evaluate a model's acceptance towards longer sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="848">These days large language models are coming up with longer and longer context windows so it's crucial that we evaluate the model's acceptability throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="849">And that is what we are trying to do here. We are trying to revisit the N - P - P pipeline by asking the model to evaluate acceptability on longer and longer sequences.</sample>
    <sample id="850">So that is the approach. So what we do is that to simulate these longer sequences, we revisit the datasets themselves and then we recreate sentences by choosing like acceptable or unacceptable sentences from those datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="851">So， for example， here we have chosen like a typical pair of grammaticality from the BliB dataset from the adjunct island case.</sample>
    <sample id="852">And what we do is that to recreate like longer sequences and which are acceptable and which has the same matching of the grammatical structure we extract grammatical sentences from adjacent tiles.</sample>
    <sample id="853">And then we add it as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query.</sample>
    <sample id="854">So we can do the same thing by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching and that could also like be used to test the model's acceptability.</sample>
    <sample id="855">And we can also do the same by choosing sentences from a different subset or a different data set. So that is what we call as the mismatch scenario.</sample>
    <sample id="856">So here the sentences are still coming from relevant data sets but it's not from the same data set that you're evaluating with. And we can do the same for an acceptability case.</sample>
    <sample id="857">Finally, we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain such as Wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="858">So this will tell us like whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context.</sample>
    <sample id="859">I'm not sure what you mean by "transcribe English content." Could you please clarify? Are you asking about how to transcribe English text? Or something else? Let me know so I can give you a proper answer.</sample>
    <sample id="860">The model first looks at Wikipedia sentences that are completely irrelevant to the current query pair. Then it finds that the MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context lengths.</sample>
    <sample id="861">We increase the context length toward up to 2024 for to max out OPT and GPT - 2 models and we saw here in the orange dotted line the MPP judgments are relatively stable.</sample>
    <sample id="862">Well, when you choose sentences from the same dataset, it can lead to some problems. For one, it might not give you a good representation of the whole dataset. You could end up with sentences that are all similar in some way, like having the same grammar structure or similar topics. This might not be very useful for things like training a model or analyzing the data in a more diverse way. But it also depends on what you're using the sentences for.If you want to know more about how to avoid this or how to get a more diverse set of sentences, feel free to ask me more.</sample>
    <sample id="863">Sure. What's your question about this? Are you having trouble with the task? Or do you want to discuss something related to the dataset?</sample>
    <sample id="864">And there we see that the MPP judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes.</sample>
    <sample id="865">When we match the structure, that is when we choose the sentences from the same phenomena in blame person text.</sample>
    <sample id="866">We see a massive increase or a massive decrease in of the MPP judgment for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable.</sample>
    <sample id="867">Now this uh uh this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window.</sample>
    <sample id="868">Well, you see, the match prefix can give the language model some context clues. It might be something that's really common or has a specific meaning in the language. For example, if it's a common phrase or a word that has a particular usage. This can make the model more likely to predict certain words or phrases that are related to that prefix. So, it can really influence its judgment on what's a good next word or sentence to follow. If you want to know more about how language models work in general, feel free to ask me.</sample>
    <sample id="869">So we did a series of analysis where we tried to perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations.</sample>
    <sample id="870">We find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the MPP just been trained.</sample>
    <sample id="871">The models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways.</sample>
    <sample id="872">When we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in MPP judgments in similar fashion.</sample>
    <sample id="873">Language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="874">And the NLP evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>

    <sample id="948">Hello Vasudha. That's great to hear about your work being accepted into ACL 2023. What would you like to know or discuss about this?</sample>
    <sample id="949">Cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent.</sample>
    <sample id="950">This belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance.</sample>
    <sample id="951">The second occurrence is justified because it shows a cause - effect relationship. The first part states that you don't think you could keep your job without them, which implies that they are important for your job security. So, the second occurrence of "they" is referring to the same thing and has a consonant relationship as it maintains the connection between the idea of not being able to keep your job without them and the importance of them.</sample>
    <sample id="952">While dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision - making, they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations.</sample>
    <sample id="953">Studying cognitive distance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends in belief, values, and attitude changes in populations.</sample>
    <sample id="954">High cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better.</sample>
    <sample id="955">Studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups.</sample>
    <sample id="956">Finally, cognitive dissonance is important to understand personal cognitive styles of individuals and helps us understand decision - making processes better.</sample>
    <sample id="957">To the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource we conducted a large - scale annotation of dissonance relations. We used a dissonance - first approach as seen in the flowchart here.</sample>
    <sample id="958">Tweets were parsed using a pre - trained parser and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to the guidelines that are described in our paper.</sample>
    <sample id="959">As can be seen here， dissonance was only found in 3.5% of the annotated pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="960">On collecting around 1000 examples of discourse unit pairs, we ran training for an initial classifier trained only on 43 examples of disnests. To no surprise, the classifier performed not much better than chance.</sample>
    <sample id="961">Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such data set we are facing the problem of absolute rarity.</sample>
    <sample id="962">To alleviate this, we experiment over combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissonant samples can be collected over lesser annotation rounds, lowering the overall annotation costs while improving dissonance detection.</sample>
    <sample id="963">Since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all, we start the co - active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="964">We transfer from two different tasks. Topic - independent dis - nance stance classification. A task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement, irrespective of topic.</sample>
    <sample id="965">Call debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of PDB. Since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them CED.</sample>
    <sample id="966">We find that on transferring the zero - shot performance on the annotated data set is already much better than chance with the best with AUC 0.62.</sample>
    <sample id="967">Further on iteratively fine - tuning on both tasks we find that fine - tuning of CE task followed by further fine - tuning on debate yields a much better zero - shot performance thus this is the model that we used to cold - start the active learning.</sample>
    <sample id="968">Next we determine the best method to update a model with new data from each round of active learning and annotations. Cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far. Iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected.</sample>
    <sample id="969">Over the different strategies we found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board.</sample>
    <sample id="970">Next to improve the number of dissonance examples we use a probability of rare class strategy, PRC, to select mostly the examples that are highly likely to be dissonant by the current model at any round of AL.</sample>
    <sample id="971">We compared this to the other state - of - the - art AI strategies that are commonly used in the community.</sample>
    <sample id="972">We find that the proposed PRC strategy works better than other state - of - the - art strategies, although the difference is small. Note that the performance is significantly lower for random.</sample>
    <sample id="973">On further rounds of AL with two best strategies we improved distance classification AUC to 0.75 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far.</sample>
    <sample id="974">We also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators. We find that PRC has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class. However, the annotators also find the examples difficult.</sample>
    <sample id="975">PRC is a simple AI strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting AI with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly.</sample>
    <sample id="976">We also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain， whereas in - domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update.</sample>

    <sample id="984">Hello everyone. My name is Justin John from the Penn State University. Today I'm gonna present our work, Exemplar Crosslingual Semantic Parsing in Multiple Natural Languages and Many Representations.</sample>
    <sample id="985">Semantic parsing is a task to build semantic representations of user queries such as SQL and lambda calculus.</sample>
    <sample id="986">Cross - lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations.</sample>
    <sample id="987">As shown in this figure， we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to SQL， Lambda or FunQL， etc.</sample>
    <sample id="988">Existing cross - lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on datasets of limited tasks and applications. For instance.</sample>
    <sample id="989">There are lots of um coverage on certain natural language. The Chinese is missing.</sample>
    <sample id="990">Lack of coverage on certain meaningful representations.</sample>
    <sample id="991">The lambda calculus is missing.</sample>
    <sample id="992">There are only evaluated on certain neural model. For example, there's only one single model to evaluate them.</sample>
    <sample id="993">So to this end we propose Exemplar. Exemplar provides a uniform dataset for cross - lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and in representations.</sample>
    <sample id="994">It contains 90 datasets in various domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 million representations and 22 natural languages in 15 language families.</sample>
    <sample id="995">And to better evaluate our benchmark we consider the six settings for training and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="996">The first one is translate test. We use Google Translate API to translate source to the target language. Then use monolingual model to train and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="997">And for example we train the English model on English query and during inference we translate the German query using API to English and then use the trained model to predict the SQL.</sample>
    <sample id="998">And we'll also test monolingual model.</sample>
    <sample id="999">Sure, what's the English content you want me to transcribe?</sample>
    <sample id="1000">We also test monolingual fusion setting by training monolingual models with only 10% of training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1001">And we test multilingual model which we train one multilingual model for all languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1002">For example, we put the German, English, Chinese queries together to train a multilingual model and during inference we can use this model to.</sample>
    <sample id="1003">German queries are "Deutsche Anfragen" or "Deutsche Fragen" in Chinese, it's "中文查询" or "中文问题". If you have more specific queries or need further translation, feel free to let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="1004">And we also consider cross - lingual zero - shot and few - shot transfer. We train on one source language and transfer to another language.</sample>
    <sample id="1005">During training, we train it on English queries or the combination of English and German few - shot queries to train a multilingual model to predict the SQL output.</sample>
    <sample id="1006">And we also find many interesting results. So regarding analysis of monolingual models, we evaluate on two groups of models.</sample>
    <sample id="1007">包括编码器PDR，即多语言预训练编码器，带有指针式解码器，如XLM - R + PDR和BERT + PDR。</sample>
    <sample id="1008">And we also evaluate encoder - decoder models which is multilingual pre - trained encoder - decoder models such as M - BART and M - T - 5.</sample>
    <sample id="1009">Encoder - decoder</sample>
    <sample id="1010">MT - 5 and XLM - R + PDR on multilingual setting.</sample>
    <sample id="1011">We found that encoder - decoder or encoder - PDR can be improved by training in a mixture of various languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1012">And we found it is because most of the major natural languages can obtain performance gain, except that English performance drops in 7 datasets and only gains in 3 datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1013">Curse of multilinguality.</sample>
    <sample id="1014">We also compare the cross - lingual performance gap.</sample>
    <sample id="1015">In this figure the blue line is cross - lingual few - shot transfer the orange line is cross - lingual zero - shot transfer while the green line is the model - lingual setting.</sample>
    <sample id="1016">We found that by comparing the green and orange line for 0 - shot setting the cross - lingual transfer performance gap is significant and comparing blue and orange line for few - shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly.</sample>
    <sample id="1017">We also find some other interesting findings. For example, encoder - decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on English natural language and significantly boosts the performance of few - shot on target natural languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1018">嗯，你是在问关于多语言模型在跨语言语义解析任务中的表现吧？确实，像Code - 10和Bloom这样的多语言模型在跨语言语义解析任务中还不够完善。你要是还有啥想法或者疑问，随时跟我说哈。</sample>
    <sample id="1019">To sum up， we build Exemplar， a unified benchmark for cross - angle semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations.</sample>
    <sample id="1020">We conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative types of multilingual language models. And our results show many interesting findings. And etc. And welcome to visit our paper and code. Thanks for listening.</sample>

    <sample id="1084">Justin John.</sample>
    <sample id="1085">Hi， I'm Zhang Bing， a PhD student at the University of Washington. Today I'm presenting our work from pre - training data to language models to downstream tasks， tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models.</sample>
    <sample id="1086">Language models are trained on large - scale web - crawled data.</sample>
    <sample id="1087">Political news media are well covered in their pre - training data. According to a survey of the C4 corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. are well covered in language model training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1088">This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1089">So on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1090">To this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre - training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions.</sample>
    <sample id="1091">Well, evaluating the political leanings of language models can be a bit tricky. One way is to look at the kind of language they use in different contexts. For example, if they tend to use more positive or negative words related to certain political groups. Another way is to see how they respond to different types of input, like different political statements or questions.As for the pre - training data, it can have a huge role in political biases. If the data used to pre - train the model is biased in some way, like it has a lot more examples from one political side than the other, then the model might pick up on that bias and carry it through. So, the quality and diversity of the pre - training data are really important.If you want to know more about this, like specific examples or other ways to deal with these biases, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1092">Well, it's a bit of a complex topic. Different political leanings in language models can lead to different biases. For example, a model trained with a more conservative dataset might be more likely to produce conservative - leaning responses on downstream tasks. And this could potentially lead to fairness issues in NLP applications. If a model is biased towards a particular political view, it might not be fair to all users. But it really depends on how the data was collected and trained. There's no one - size - fits - all answer.If you want to know more about this, like specific examples or ways to mitigate these issues, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1093">So specifically we first propose two prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires such as the Political Compass test. This ensures us to do automatic evaluation well - grounded in political science literature.</sample>
    <sample id="1094">First - language models do have varying political leanings. They occupy all four quadrants on the political compass.</sample>
    <sample id="1095">GPT - 4 is the most liberal language model among them all. GPT series are generally more socially liberal than BERT series and its variants.</sample>
    <sample id="1096">Secondly, we aim to investigate to which extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1097">So we could conduct a controlled experiment by further pre - training language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="1098">By further pre - training language models on such partisan corpora， we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift.</sample>
    <sample id="1099">For example， for Roberta further fine - tuned and further trained on the left - leaning Reddit corpus， we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its.</sample>
    <sample id="1100">I'm not sure which specific thing you're referring to. There are so many things that could have political biases. Can you be more specific?</sample>
    <sample id="1101">And we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarization that's prevalent in our modern society.</sample>
    <sample id="1102">So we divide pre - training corpora into pre - 45th president of the United States and after 45th president of the United States. We separately pre - train language models on the two different temporal corpora.</sample>
    <sample id="1103">We can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017. So this indicates that language models can also pick up the like polarization in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1104">So last but not least we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate - speech detection and fake news detection two NLP applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications.</sample>
    <sample id="1105">So we see that if we investigate the per - category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into.</sample>
    <sample id="1106">Different demographics or political leaning of news media. We can see a pattern that, for example, for hate - speech detection, left - leaning language models are better.</sample>
    <sample id="1107">Well, there are a few ways. First, you can look for specific language that is known to be offensive to certain groups. For example, using slurs or derogatory terms. Also, the context matters. If someone is repeatedly making negative comments about a particular group in a public space, that could be a sign. And sometimes, the intent behind the speech can be a clue. If it seems like the speaker is trying to spread hate or discrimination, that's a red flag.If you want to know more about how to deal with it or other related things, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1108">Yes, they are. They often use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify patterns in language that are associated with hate speech against powerful groups. But it's not perfect, there can still be some false positives or false negatives. What made you ask this?</sample>
    <sample id="1109">And vice versa. Large language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men. However, worse at detecting hate speech targeting black, LGBTQ+, and other minority communities.</sample>
    <sample id="1110">Similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left - leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning and vice versa.</sample>
    <sample id="1111">This in our referential show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="1112">Sure. For hate speech, it often targets a specific group based on things like race, gender, or religion. It's usually very aggressive and intended to harm or demean that group. For misinformation, it can spread false information about a wide range of topics, like health, politics, or science. It's often designed to mislead and manipulate public opinion.If you want to discuss more about these examples or have other questions, feel free to let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="1113">This indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models.</sample>
    <sample id="1114">For example， if a right - leaning language model were to be fine - tuned on hate speech or misinformation and whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform.</sample>
    <sample id="1115">This would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control.</sample>
    <sample id="1116">So this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="1117">So a little bit of discussion. We would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases. It's like between Scylla and Charybdis.</sample>
    <sample id="1118">Yes, that's right. If we don't sanitize political opinion in language model training data, the bias will indeed propagate. This can lead to fairness issues in downstream tasks. So, it's really important to be careful about this. What do you think about this? Do you have any other ideas or questions related to this?</sample>
    <sample id="1119">If we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retained in language model training data so it's kind of like the electric electric charlie problem.</sample>

    <sample id="1128">Hello! It's great to meet you, Coyote. I'm looking forward to your presentation on "When Does Translation Require Context: A Data - Driven Multilingual Exploration". It sounds really interesting. I'm curious to hear more about the data - driven approach and the collaboration with Patrick Franasz, Emile Liu, Andre F. T. Martins, and Graham Newbigg.</sample>
    <sample id="1129">Well, it depends on the context. If it's about a mole as in the small animal, it's "mole". But if it's about a mole as in a mole on the skin, it's "mole". So, you really need to know what the context is. What kind of context are you thinking about?</sample>
    <sample id="1130">If the previous sentence was "Things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out" then "Moll" refers to a spy. But if the previous sentence was "Could it be anything serious, doctor?" then "Moll" refers to a birthmark.</sample>
    <sample id="1131">Yes, that's right. The meaning of a word can vary based on context, and so can its translation. For example, the word "bank" can mean a financial institution or the side of a river. So, it's important to consider the context when translating. What other language-related questions do you have?</sample>
    <sample id="1132">However, evaluating how well models can translate cases like this is pretty hard. Firstly, because only a small portion of translations depend on context, which makes corpus - level metrics like BLEU unable to capture these translations.</sample>
    <sample id="1133">And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context - dependent translations. But these resources only support limited types of context - dependent translations and limited sets of languages. Since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation.</sample>
    <sample id="1134">In this work we try to answer these two questions. First, when does translation require context? And second, how well do models handle these cases?</sample>
    <sample id="1135">To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context during translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1136">In the previous work we introduced CxMI as a measure for context uses by machine translation models. And this is done by measuring how much information the context C provides about the target Y given the source X.</sample>
    <sample id="1137">You can think of CMI as the information gain from giving context to the model.</sample>
    <sample id="1138">In this work we extend C - X - M - I to point - wise C - X - M - I which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. We can think of words that have high p - C - X - M - I as ones that require context for translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1139">Now we analyze words with high P - SMI to look for patterns between these words.</sample>
    <sample id="1140">Sure. So, you're analyzing TED talk transcripts that have been translated into 14 languages? That's quite a task! What are you looking for in these analyses?</sample>
    <sample id="1141">We perform our analysis at three different levels. First we look at part - of - speech tags that have high means p - x - mi.</sample>
    <sample id="1142">And this allows us to find, for example, dual pronouns in Arabic that have relatively high P - X - I. And this can be explained because English doesn't have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into Arabic.</sample>
    <sample id="1143">And similarly we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose appropriate verb form. We then look at vocabulary items that have high P - sex and my average over all of its different occurrences.</sample>
    <sample id="1144">And this helps identify cases like the one here where in Chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document.</sample>
    <sample id="1145">And similarly we find that context is important to translate in the right formality.</sample>
    <sample id="1146">And finally we look at different individual tokens that have high p - x - m - i. And this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself but that's further expressed in the sentence structure such as ellipsis resolution.</sample>
    <sample id="1147">So now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document - level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1148">For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create taggers to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse aware or MUDA tagger.</sample>
    <sample id="1149">We can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discursive phenomena.</sample>
    <sample id="1150">We then use the MUDATagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation. And we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context - dependent examples that the MUDATagger has identified.</sample>
    <sample id="1151">And finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate different models on document - level machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1152">First of all, when we use corpus level metrics, so for BLEU, we find that context - agnostic models have the best performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1153">But then if we use Comet context aware models perform best. And if we use word F - measure then models with and without context have comparable performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1154">This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document - level translation system if we use corpus - level metrics alone.</sample>
    <sample id="1155">Now we use the MUMA benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion.</sample>
    <sample id="1156">But these models are not much better than models that did not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis, pronouns, and verb form. So this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document - level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1157">We also compared different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that DeepL is usually more accurate than Google Translate for document - level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1158">We did a data - driven analysis on 14 language pairs to find out when translations need context.</sample>
    <sample id="1159">And then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document - level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse - phenomenon models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document - level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1160">Thank you so much for your attention. See you in Toronto.</sample>
    <sample id="1161">The abbreviations of the five methods for the first research question are not mentioned in the given text. So, I can't answer that. But if you have any other questions about this research, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1162">The model is evaluated on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks. If you want to know more about these tasks, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1163">Hi. Welcome to our presentation of DeepLing, a new corpus for German text identification on the document level and on the sentence level.</sample>
    <sample id="1164">My name is Regina Jordan and I will guide you for the first part of the presentation. Let's first define text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1165">Text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group, as people with reading problems or non-native speakers.</sample>
    <sample id="1166">To train a text summarization model, we require parallel pairs of text, for example, abstracts of documents or sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="1167">Sure. What's the next question?</sample>
    <sample id="1168">Different techniques are possible as you can see in the example. Such as lexical substitution, clause deletion, clause insertion, reordering or insertion of words.</sample>
    <sample id="1169">We now propose our new corpus to be plain. Because in the recent years there were some problems with existing corpora. So for example, these corpora here are too small to train a text classification model on.</sample>
    <sample id="1170">The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned which means they can be error - prone in their alignments.</sample>
    <sample id="1171">Therefore， we propose our new corpus， DeepL， which is split into two sub - corpora， DeepL - API and DeepL - Web. DeepL - API is based on news texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1172">In DeepL and APA, we aligned 483 documents all manually. It results in roughly 30, 000 - 13, 000 parallel sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1173">For DeepL and Web, the corpus includes different domains. We also align all of these 750 documents, on the one hand, manually and, on the other hand, with automatic alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1174">In total we result in thirty - thousand - four hundred and fifty sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1175">We analyzed our sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1176">The Bible texts are much stronger simplified than, for example, the news texts or the language learner texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1177">Lexical simplification is about making words and phrases easier to understand. For example, using simpler words instead of complex ones. Structural simplification is about simplifying the grammatical structure of a sentence. It might involve shortening long sentences or breaking them into shorter, simpler ones. Overall simplification is a broader concept that takes into account both lexical and structural aspects, aiming to make the whole text or message easier to comprehend. So, what do you think about these simplification methods? Do you have any examples in mind?</sample>
    <sample id="1178">Furthermore, you can see that our Deplain corpus has a high variety of different simplification transformations. So, for example, in the Deplain API corpus we have much more reorderings and word additions than we have in the Deplain web corpus.</sample>
    <sample id="1179">On the other hand，在 the web corpus， we have much more rephrasing.</sample>
    <sample id="1180">So let's now see what we can do with this corpus. Hello, I am Omar and now I will talk about the use cases for our dataset deeply. So for the first use case, we can evaluate automatic alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1181">In recent years, there have been many alignment methods in the context of machine translations.</sample>
    <sample id="1182">Well, there are a few ways to do that. One common method is using machine translation tools. You can run the English document through a translation tool like Google Translate or DeepL, and then compare the translated version with the other language document. Another approach could be using specialized software for parallel document analysis. These tools often have algorithms that can identify sentence alignments based on similarities in vocabulary and structure.If you want to do it manually, you could start by looking for common words or phrases in both documents. But that can be really time - consuming.So, which method do you think might work best for you?</sample>
    <sample id="1183">In our use case, we are trying to extract alignments between sentences of two parallel documents having the same language having the same content but they are on a different complexity levels.</sample>
    <sample id="1184">And now as we have our dataset DeepL - en which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1185">And we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1186">At the end we concluded that the best alignment automatic alignment method to use for texts for German text simplification is the method of mass align.</sample>
    <sample id="1187">And you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1188">The second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1189">Fine - tuning language models to produce simplified text from complex input text is a process where the model is adjusted to better understand and generate simpler versions of complex texts. This can be done by training the model on a large dataset of complex and simplified texts, so it can learn the patterns and rules for simplification. It's useful for things like making technical documents more accessible to a wider audience. So, what do you think about this? Do you have any specific examples in mind?</sample>
    <sample id="1190">We have fine - tuned two different models. We have fine - tuned a model of long input to produce document - level simplifications.</sample>
    <sample id="1191">And we also fine - tuned the normal base long - the normal base import to produce sentence - level simplifications.</sample>
    <sample id="1192">You can also find all the checkpoints and look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1193">We concluded that this basic fine - tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores.</sample>
    <sample id="1194">And we propose those results as a benchmark a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future.</sample>
    <sample id="1195">Thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference. Thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="1196">Sure.</sample>
    <sample id="1197">My name is Javad Hosseini and this is a joint work with Filip Radlinski, Silvia Paoletti and Arif Mousa.</sample>
    <sample id="1198">Easy on Me or I Got a Feeling?</sample>
    <sample id="1199">The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example, by saying the name of the song is "Easy on Me" or its position, the first one.</sample>
    <sample id="1200">But sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation. This could happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song.</sample>
    <sample id="1201">All the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to disambiguate.</sample>
    <sample id="1202">The newer one or the song that's not energetic.</sample>
    <sample id="1203">This is an important problem in conversational systems and also for benchmarking and NLP's entity understanding.</sample>
    <sample id="1204">We're not aware of a public dataset a large - scale public dataset for the task so we collect one using crowd annotation. Our dataset covers three different domains music books and recipes.</sample>
    <sample id="1205">Our dataset collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion set.</sample>
    <sample id="1206">Remember that song we were listening to yesterday?</sample>
    <sample id="1207">Do you mean easy on me or I got a feeling?</sample>
    <sample id="1208">The alternative quest.</sample>
    <sample id="1209">The first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain.</sample>
    <sample id="1210">I'm not sure what the alternative question is. Can you tell me more about it?</sample>
    <sample id="1211">I'm not sure which template you're referring to. Can you give me a bit more context? Maybe tell me what the templates are about or what the samples from Wikipedia are?</sample>
    <sample id="1212">When we move higher in the list， the entities become more similar to each other and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation.</sample>
    <sample id="1213">Uniform attractor.</sample>
    <sample id="1214">The second one is when the entities have similar titles, for example two books with the name "The Return".</sample>
    <sample id="1215">The third one is when they have similar descriptions on Wikipedia and finally when they have similar infoboxes or attributes on Wikipedia, for example the same genre or the same artist for a song.</sample>
    <sample id="1216">When we show this alternative question to the answerers they know the name of these entities but they don't necessarily know about the entity.</sample>
    <sample id="1217">So what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities. For songs, we simply show a Google search link to each song.</sample>
    <sample id="1218">And then ask the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song. Here's for example the Google search result for the song "Easy".</sample>
    <sample id="1219">Recipes and books domain shows some background text from Wikipedia. For recipes, it also shows their images from Wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like.</sample>
    <sample id="1220">Sure.</sample>
    <sample id="1221">The one with the piano music.</sample>
    <sample id="1222">The entity's corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions. Results with T5-xl model are summarized below.</sample>
    <sample id="1223">If the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators, then the accuracy is really high. It's around 92 to 95 percent. But this is not realistic.</sample>
    <sample id="1224">The accuracy is between 82% to 87% when the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="1225">If the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60% so there's a lot of room for improvement. We've also shown that the models are domain generalizable. Here is a link to our dataset. Thanks for.</sample>

    <sample id="1227">Adam Skowroński.</sample>
    <sample id="1228">The findings were that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap when retraining or continuing to pretrain models with more recent data. This confirmed the hypothesis that temporal drift is the main cause of performance drop. If you have any other questions about this, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1229">Hi everyone. I'm Jenny, a first - year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. And today I'll be presenting your work on "Analyzing and Characterizing Design Biases in Datasets and Models.".If you have any questions or comments about this, feel free to let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="1230">This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Santi, Runen Le Bras, Katerina Rineka, and Morten Sap.</sample>
    <sample id="1231">Well, first you'd look for comments that use offensive language, like racial slurs or insults. Then, if there are comments that are threatening or promote violence, those should be removed too. Also, comments that are just spam or completely irrelevant to the article can be taken out. And if a comment is just a rant without any real point, it might be best to delete it. What do you think about this? Do you have any specific examples of toxic comments you've come across?</sample>
    <sample id="1232">You might turn towards a popular API like Perspective API for toxicity detection. And this works really well if you're Carl Jones. Where Perspective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances.</sample>
    <sample id="1233">But that's not really the case for Aditya Sharma where perspective API is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="1234">This is an example of a design bias where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations.</sample>
    <sample id="1235">Design biases might occur due to the positionality of NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is the perspectives people hold because of their demographics, identity, and life experiences.</sample>
    <sample id="1236">This is a concept widely used in critical studies specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces.</sample>
    <sample id="1237">Positionality can influence the research process and its outcomes and results because it can change the decisions that researchers make.</sample>
    <sample id="1238">Well, datasets and models can have positionality. For example, a dataset might be centered around a certain region or group, and a model trained on that dataset might be more likely to perform well on data from that same region or group. But it's not always the case. There are models that are designed to be more general and not be too influenced by the positionality of the data they were trained on.If you want to know more about how to deal with positionality in datasets and models, feel free to ask me more.</sample>
    <sample id="1239">And we're not trying to say that models and data sets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences. But they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others.</sample>
    <sample id="1240">Prior work has suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality such as cultural gaps in models and datasets as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1241">However, these works really don't look at comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves.</sample>
    <sample id="1242">Positionality is increasingly important as NLP tasks become more subjective and socially oriented.</sample>
    <sample id="1243">In its challenging to characterize how these position alities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind APIs.</sample>
    <sample id="1244">To study dataset and model positionality, we compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="1245">We do this through our framework and our positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1246">Our framework works in two main steps.</sample>
    <sample id="1247">The first step is to re - annotate data sets with diverse annotators.</sample>
    <sample id="1248">And we ought to do this over looking at the demographics of original datasets' annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared.</sample>
    <sample id="1249">And so we opt to reannotate data to get many annotations for instance and to get a rich set of demographic data.</sample>
    <sample id="1250">We then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using a Pearson's r correlation score.</sample>
    <sample id="1251">And thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and datasets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just annotator - annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions.</sample>
    <sample id="1252">Yes, they are. If you want to know more about how they work or other related things, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1253">In Lab in the Wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to platforms like MTurk which largely have participants from the US or India. And further Lab in the Wild still is able to get high - quality data.</sample>
    <sample id="1254">We host two tasks on Lab in the Wild, one of them being social acceptability. And the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the Social Chemistry dataset and then they'll rate how socially acceptable a situation is.</sample>
    <sample id="1255">Afterwards, to stay engaged in the study, they can compare their responses to an AI and others.</sample>
    <sample id="1256">We then compared these annotations with social chemistry Delphi in GPT - 4.</sample>
    <sample id="1257">We then replicate a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate - speech detection task where they'll read an instance from dinah - hate and rate whether they think it's an instance of hate - speech.</sample>
    <sample id="1258">We then compared these annotations with Dina hate perspective API, Rewire API, hate Roberta, and GPT - 4. Our study in the end amassed over 16, 000 annotations from over a thousand annotators from 87 countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1259">So now we're better equipped to answer who do NLP datasets and models align with the most. We find that there is positionality in NLP.</sample>
    <sample id="1260">For example, we find that datasets and models are most aligned to English - speaking countries. So for the GPT - 4 social acceptability analysis, we find that it's most aligned to Confucian and English - speaking countries. We find that DAINA - HATE is also most aligned to English - speaking countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1261">We also find most additional alignment with people who have a college education. So for GPT - 4 in the social acceptability task we find that it's most aligned to people with a college education or graduate school education.</sample>
    <sample id="1262">And we find the same for Donny Hate where it's most aligned to people with a college education.</sample>
    <sample id="1263">However, when models and datasets are aligned to specific populations, some are inevitably left behind.</sample>
    <sample id="1264">An example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to their men and women counterparts. We find this in the GPD for social acceptability task as well as the DINE - HATE task analysis as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1265">Well, first of all, you could try to find a new position that better suits your skills and interests. Maybe look for job openings in different industries or job titles. Another option is to improve your current position by taking on more responsibilities or getting additional training. You could also consider networking with people in your field to see if they can offer any advice or opportunities. And don't forget to keep your resume and cover letter up - to - date so you can easily apply for new positions if needed.If you want to talk more about this or have other questions, feel free to let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="1266">So we have a few recommendations for this. First one is keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process. And the other is to do NLP research with the lens of perspectivism.</sample>
    <sample id="1267">Our third recommendation is to build specialized datasets and models within four specific communities. And a good example of this is the Musa Connie initiative. I mean we want to emphasize that inclusive NLP isn't just making all technologies work for everyone.</sample>
    <sample id="1268">And so that concludes our presentation. But if you'd like to learn more, feel free to check out our dashboard for the most updated analysis results and our paper. Thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="1269">Well, you know, the tokens might be in a random order at first. And if we want the output sequence to be meaningful, we need to put them in the right order. So, we use another model to predict a permutation to do that. It's like making sure the words in a sentence are in the correct order to make sense. So, that's why it's necessary to permute the tokens for the output sequence. If you have any other questions about this, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1270">The authors recommended increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because they were unsure if positive stereotypes were due to weirdly excessive value alignment or other anti - stereotyping methods causing pernicious patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="1271">Well, in the minimal - pair paradigm, the unacceptable inputs are the grammatically incorrect sentences. You know, like those sentences that don't follow the rules of the language. So, if you show a grammatically correct sentence and then an unacceptable one, the model should be able to tell the difference. If it doesn't, that's a problem. So, what do you think about this? Do you have any other questions related to this?</sample>

    <sample id="1280">The findings imply that smaller models like the T5 can outperform larger models in generating high - quality scripts when trained on suitable datasets.

    <sample id="1351">The data was taken from transcriptions of TED talks that have been translated from English to 14 different languages. If you have any other questions about this, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1352">Sure, what would you like to know about the dependency structure of coordination?</sample>
    <sample id="1353">As you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. So for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate Lisa Bart and Maggie.</sample>
    <sample id="1354">Yes, that's correct. "Lisa" is the head of the coordinate structure. If you have any other questions about this or something else, feel free to let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="1355">A similar approach is assumed in economic texts, meaning text theory, where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. So these two approaches are isometric, right? They single out one of the conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1356">Now there are also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures such as the "trunk" approach. The conjunction-headed approach is seen in "trunk" dependency treebanks, where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction.</sample>
    <sample id="1357">So we get some dependencies from end to all the conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1358">And finally there's also a multi - headed approach that's used for example in the Katz - Sussman word grammar.</sample>
    <sample id="1359">Where some say all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure so we get dependencies from the governor here loves to all conjuncts separately these are bottom smack</sample>
    <sample id="1360">The aim of the paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like this and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like this.</sample>
    <sample id="1361">Okay.</sample>
    <sample id="1362">So in English, as you might know, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away, right? So "Mark read it yesterday" is fine because the direct object "it" is close to the verb.</sample>
    <sample id="1363">While March read "Yesterday" it is much worse right? Because here between the verb and the direct object there's an adjective "Yesterday".</sample>
    <sample id="1364">However, this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long, because then it can be moved to the position after the agent.</sample>
    <sample id="1365">March read this absolutely fascinating book about the bees yesterday. It's okay. The way instead of it we have this long and pain.</sample>
    <sample id="1366">March read yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about bees.</sample>
    <sample id="1367">The reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb.</sample>
    <sample id="1368">It satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization, which says that shorter dependencies are preferred.</sample>
    <sample id="1369">So, these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies, so the ones that are not constant among these two structures.</sample>
    <sample id="1370">So here we have a dependency from red to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from red to book of length 4 so together it's 11.</sample>
    <sample id="1371">When you move when you swap are these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one</sample>
    <sample id="1372">Okay. So what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the dependency bank and see the paper why wouldn't you use university dependencies.</sample>
    <sample id="1373">I'm not sure if the statistics confirm that observation. You could try looking at some linguistic research or data sets on word length in different languages. Maybe there are some studies that have looked at this specifically. Why are you interested in this? It'd be great if you could share more.</sample>
    <sample id="1374">The tendency grows with the length difference.</sample>
    <sample id="1375">Yes, that's right. When the difference in length between the two conjuncts grows, the shorter conjunct tends to be the first one stronger, and the proportion of the left short conjunct becomes bigger. If you have any other questions about this, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="1376">The novel aspect in this paper is that we observed this tendency only occurs when the governance on the left are absent.</sample>
    <sample id="1377">Yes, the governor is on the left. If you have any other questions about this example or anything else, feel free to let me know.</sample>
    <sample id="1378">It's absent in the second example Homer came and sneezed. Here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1379">However, when the governance on the right, as here, left governs the coordination to the net, this effect disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1380">So we showed that by measuring length in characters, that's the first column, in syllables, the middle column, and in words, the right column. So I'll concentrate on the right one.</sample>
    <sample id="1381">When the governor is on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="1382">The tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words, and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences, but when the governor is on the right, this tendency disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1383">And we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two.</sample>
    <sample id="1384">So see the paper for the full agreements and arguments. Sorry and talk to us about it in the poster session. Thank you.</sample>

    <sample id="1386">Cross-lingual transfer is training a model on one source language and then transferring it to another language. For example, training on English queries or a combination of English and German few-shot queries to create a multilingual model.

    <sample id="1531">Hello everyone. My name is Ying and my colleague Zhiyang and I will be presenting our research on multi - instruct: improving multi - model zero - shot learning via instruction - tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1532">So with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre - trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter - and - data - efficient way.</sample>
    <sample id="1533">Recently， many studies have shown that instruction - tuning enables large language models to perform on N - sync tasks in a zero - shot manner by following natural instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1534">However, most previous works on instruction - tuning focused on improving the zero - shot performance on language - only tasks, while computer vision and multi - modal tasks have been left out.</sample>
    <sample id="1535">In this work， we want to investigate whether instruction - tuning a multi - modal pre - trained model can actually improve generalization to n - scene multi - modal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1536">Additionally， at the time of our research， we discovered a considerable discrepancy in availability of instruction dataset between L - P and multi - model.</sample>
    <sample id="1537">There exist more than 1600 language - only instruction tasks. However, there is no large - scale publicly available multimodal instruction task. Therefore, this motivates us to build a multimodal instruction - tuning dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1538">Here we present MultiInstruct. The first multimodal instruction - tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multimodal tasks covering 10 broad categories.</sample>
    <sample id="1539">These tasks are derived from 21 existing open - source datasets and each task is equipped with 5 expert - written instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1540">For investigating multimodal instruction - tuning on our proposed dataset we take OFA a unified multimodal pre - trained model as our base model. OFA use a unified vocabulary for language image tokens and the coordinate of a bounding box.</sample>
    <sample id="1541">Here we show some example instances from our multi - intra data set.</sample>
    <sample id="1542">Yes, there are ways to unify the processing of various input and output data types. For example, in programming, you can use data conversion functions. In some cases, you might need to define a common data structure that all data types can be converted to. This can make it easier to process data uniformly. So, if you have different data types coming in and going out, you can find ways to make them all fit into a single processing framework. What kind of data types are you dealing with specifically?</sample>
    <sample id="1543">We follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence - to - sequence format in which the input text, images, instruction and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space.</sample>
    <sample id="1544">Sure. What would you like to know about multimodal instruction tuning?</sample>
    <sample id="1545">For the training dataset， we use 53 tasks from NAGroup for training and we sample 10， 000 instances per task. For testing， we reserve the entire commonsense reasoning group for testing and we select additional 5 tasks from VQA and the miscellaneous group.</sample>
    <sample id="1546">We use all the instance in the test split for each task. In addition we randomly sample 20 task from the test split of natural instruction as on - syn task for NLP.</sample>
    <sample id="1547">So we use a pre - trained OFA - large model as a base model. During training, we mix all the instance for all the tasks. Each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates.</sample>
    <sample id="1548">During test for each task we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment.</sample>
    <sample id="1549">I'm not sure what the performance data is. You need to provide the data first so I can calculate the mean, max, and standard deviation. Go ahead and share the data.</sample>
    <sample id="1550">Accuracy for multimodal classification tasks, ROUGE - L for multimodal generation tasks, and ROUGE - L for NLP tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1551">We also introduced an additional evaluation metric called sensitivity. So this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variation in the wording of the instruction.</sample>
    <sample id="1552">Instruction tuning can significantly improve OFA's performance on unseen multimodal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1553">Transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can benefit instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1554">As the amount of task increase the model achieve better performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1555">So we also did the experiments. We use one instruction versus five instruction. As we can see, using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot.</sample>
    <sample id="1556">So this shows the effect of different finetuning strategy on the model sensitivity. As we can see, by transfer learning from natural instruction dataset, the model can achieve much better sensitivity comparing to the original L - frame model.</sample>
    <sample id="1557">We also can see transfer learning from natural instruction dataset can help OFA to achieve much better performance on the natural instruct dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1558">So overall we are proposed the first large - scale multi - model instruction - tuning dataset which significantly improves the zero - shot capability of OFA and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits. We design a new metric called sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1559">We are collecting a much larger multimodal instruction - tuning dataset with around 150 additional vision - language tasks and we will release them soon. This is the QR code for our data and model. Thank you.</sample>
