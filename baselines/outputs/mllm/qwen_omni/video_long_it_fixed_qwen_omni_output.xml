    <sample id="67">The paper discusses the challenges of interference in multilingual translation models, particularly focusing on how interference affects the performance of these models. It highlights that interference can occur due to the synergy or conflict between different language pairs in the model. The authors propose several methods to alleviate interference, including using small models and tuning baselines, but note that these methods do not always work better than the tuned baselines. They also identify that severe interference occurs when the model is very small compared to the data size. The paper suggests that tuning the sampling temperature is key to achieving strong performance. The authors conclude that language similarity is not a dominant factor for interference and that interference is more likely to occur in parameter-poor settings. They recommend training multilingual models on all languages across sizes and temperatures and using temperature sampling to reduce interference.</sample>

The paper discusses the challenges of label bias in large language models (LLMs) and proposes a domain-context calibration method to mitigate these biases. The authors argue that the task corpus significantly affects model performance, especially in tasks with large domain-label bias. They introduce a domain-context calibration approach that improves in-context learning by addressing both small and large domain-label biases. The method involves contextual calibration, domain-context calibration, and vanilla label bias calibration. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms previous calibration methods, particularly in tasks with large domain-label bias. They also show that the model's performance is improved by calibrating the model's uncontextual preference for label names and by mitigating context-label bias. The paper concludes that domain-context calibration is a powerful tool for improving the robustness and generalization of LLMs in the presence of label bias.</sample>

The presentation explores the effectiveness of human explanations in machine learning models, focusing on their role in enhancing model performance and user understanding. It begins by questioning whether human explanations are always helpful and introduces the concept of objective evaluation of human natural language explanations. The study involves four main components: motivations, shoulders of giants, primary contributions, and future work. The motivations highlight the benefits of human explanations, such as boosting prediction performance and enhancing model reasoning. The shoulders of giants section discusses the limitations of existing evaluation metrics, particularly TREU, which is less helpful than ECQA. The primary contributions include a unified structure for evaluating human explanations, a preliminary experiment on CoS-E v1.0, and a discussion on the impact of human explanations on model performance. The future work section suggests that fine-tuning models with human explanations can teach them to rely on explanations for prediction, even with a small amount of data. The presentation concludes with a call for high-quality human annotation and the need for a similar quality check in the future.</sample>
