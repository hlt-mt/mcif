    <sample id="2">The paper presents a novel pre - trained model, LayoutMask, for Visually - rich Document Understanding, VrDU. It aims to address reading order issues in existing models. LayoutMask uses text and layout information, focusing on local 1D position instead of global 1D. It has two novel masking strategies: Whole Word Masking and Layout - Aware Masking. Whole Word Masking eliminates semantic relations between masked and unmasked tokens, promoting text - layout interactions. Layout - Aware Masking masks first and last words of each segment, encouraging attention to context in preceding or succeeding segments. A new pre - training objective, Masked Position Modeling, is also introduced. Experiments show that Local - 1D outperforms Global - 1D on FUNSD and SROIE datasets, especially for the entity "Total". This suggests LayoutMask is more adaptive to complex layouts. For more details, refer to the paper and posters.</sample>

    <sample id="6">Jiaan presents a joint work on "Towards Unifying Multi - L - ingual and Cross - L - ingual Summarization" with several colleagues. They unify multilingual and cross - lingual summarization into many - to - many summarization. This aims to build a single model for summarizing documents in any source language and generating summaries in any target language. They find that many - to - many summarization can better transfer task knowledge across languages compared to previous methods. They propose PISCES, a pre - trained many - to - many summarization model. It learns language modeling, cross - lingual ability, and summarization ability through a three - stage pre - training. They compare it with multilingual and cross - lingual summarization on the WikiLingua dataset. The results show PISCES outperforms baselines. They also conduct ablation studies and human studies to verify its effectiveness. For more details, check out their paper.</sample>

    <sample id="8">The novelty of the proposed human evaluation method is that it explicitly annotates whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, like responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself. This reduces the subjectivity of human evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="9">The success of the existing weakly supervised approach heavily relies on clean, manually annotated samples.</sample>
    <sample id="10">Well, if the language model has access to more background knowledge, like the annotators do, the score can be improved. Also, if the model can retrieve more relevant background knowledge, that would help. And if it could understand and use indirect referring expressions better, that would also be a big plus. So, you know, there are quite a few ways to go about it. What do you think?</sample>

He mentions examples like ChatGPT and Google's PaLM. However, he questions if these models really understand humor. He introduces The New Yorker Caption Contest data for humor understanding tasks. For matching and quality ranking, CLIP fine - tuned on the corpus achieves 62% accuracy, while humans get 94%. GPT - 4, when conditioned with image descriptions, still has a big performance gap.

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presented his work on adaptive inference in low - resource settings. He discussed two methods: Multi Model and Early Exit. Multi Model is more versatile but expensive to store and has overhead. Early Exit is faster and memory - efficient but can suffer from conflicting gradients. His study compared Multi Model and Early Exit classifiers on BERT - base and BERT - large. Multi Model classifiers outperformed Early Exit on average by 2. 3%. SWEET, a novel fine - tuning method for Early Exit, was introduced. It avoids conflicting gradients by training each layer to only receive updates from its following classifier. SWEET closes the gap between Early Exit and Multi Model in some cases but negatively affects later classifiers in others. In fast speeds, SWEET outperforms both methods. The work shows conflicting gradients in Early Exit training and provides a fair comparison of Multi Model and Early Exit. It also introduces SWEET, motivating future research.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student at NUS, introduces their work on multimodal relation extraction. Relation extraction aims to find semantic relations between entities in text. In social media, data is in various forms. Multimodal relation extraction adds visual sources to textual relation extraction. Problems include internal - information over - utilization and external - information under - exploitation. To address these, they propose a Graph Information Bottleneck - guided feature refinement. They represent text and images with scene graphs, merge them into a unified backbone cross - modal graph, CMG. Then they screen and adjust CMG, enrich it with multimodal topic features. Experiments on a MRE dataset show that leveraging visual features improves performance compared to text - based methods. Ablation study shows that information screening and exploiting external information contribute to task performance. The work introduces a novel idea of simultaneous information subtraction and addition for multimodal relation extraction, achieving significant improvements over existing models.</sample>

    <sample id="19">Zhang Qin, a Shenzhen University master's student, presented their work "A Survey for Efficient Open Domain Question Answering" at ACL 2023. Their work focuses on open - domain question answering, using a two - stage model. The first stage retrieves evidence contexts from a Wikipedia corpus, and the second stage uses a reader to answer questions. Challenges include the large size of the Wikipedia corpus and the index file, which affects inference speed. The motivation is to achieve efficient systems with smaller memory costs, faster inference, and comparable performance. They summarize core techniques like approximate nearest neighbor search for fast evidence research, skip reading for fast reading, and index size reduction through document filtering and embedding. They compare existing models and conclude that retrieval - only systems are good for limited resources and real - time feedback, while retrieval and reader systems are better for trade - offs. Future works include deploying in low - power devices and considering more evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="22">Well, there are three main ingredients for good generalization. The first one is the model architecture, like transformer models usually generalize better. The second is the model size, larger models tend to lead to better generalization. And the third is the number of fine tuning examples, more fine tuning examples also lead to better generalization. So, you see, it's not just one factor but a combination of these three. If you want to know more about this or have other questions, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="23">The research focuses on improving text image models' ability to render visual text. It discusses the Imagen model, which uses a T5-XXL encoder for text input and a diffusion model for image generation. However, these models often fail to represent text well. T5 uses SentencePiece tokenization, which can make it hard to spell words accurately. Experiments show T5 has low spelling accuracy, while larger PaLM models perform better but are impractical due to size and data requirements. ByT5, which uses character - level information, has high spelling accuracy. The study suggests augmenting the Imagen model with ByT5 - small to improve spelling and text rendering. This approach isn't perfect as the diffusion model can introduce errors. The main takeaways include the WikiSpell benchmark for text - only models and the DrawText benchmark for text - to - image models, along with a new strategy for improving spelling ability by concatenating a character - aware model.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The paper introduces LLM-Blender, an ensemble learning framework for large language models. It focuses on pairwise ranking and generative fusion. The team from AI2 and USC argues that using a single top model isn't optimal for all input examples. They propose a two - stage framework. In the first stage, different models are run on an input, and PairRanker compares them. This module encodes pairs of candidates with the input for better analysis. The second stage uses the top K candidates for a sequence - to - sequence model to generate a final output. PairRanker is better than other methods as it uses pairwise comparisons. The framework is evaluated on the MixInstruct dataset, showing Blender's results outperforming top models in many cases. LLM - Blender is simple yet effective, improving performance significantly.</sample>

    <sample id="34">The work presents CREST, a joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual text generation. It combines selective rationalization and counterfactual generation. The rationalizer model generates rationales and counterfactuals. For counterfactuals, it masks the original input and uses a masked language model to fill in new tokens. Evaluation shows CREST counterfactuals are more valid and natural than those from other methods. CREST can be used for data augmentation and rationalization with both factual and counterfactual examples. It outperforms other methods on IMDB and contrastive datasets. CREST - Rationalization produces more plausible rationales and higher counterfactual simulability. Overall, CREST is a controllable way to generate valid, fluent, and diverse counterfactuals.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The paper presents a solution for multilingual machine translation called Language - Specific Layers, LSLs. It aims to increase capacity per language where it matters most while keeping inference costs constant. LSLs use one regular transformer layer per language. At inference time, only the relevant sublayer is called. The authors focus on encoder placement of LSLs, letting the model learn the best placement. They use a large model with three weights per encoder layer: shared, source, and target. After training, they select the best placement based on the largest weight. Experiments on WMT21 news translation data show significant improvements over baseline models, especially for low - resource languages. The improvements are statistically significant for most translation directions. For more details, check out the full paper or poster session.</sample>

    <sample id="50">The presentation introduces DEPLAIN, a new corpus for German text identification on document and sentence levels. It defines text simplification as adapting text for better comprehension by non-native speakers or those with reading problems. DEPLAIN is proposed to address problems with existing corpora, being split into DEPLAIN-apa and DEPLAIN-web. DEPLAIN-apa has 483 manually aligned news documents resulting in 13, 000 sentence pairs, while DEPLAIN-web has 750 documents across different domains, resulting in 30, 450 pairs. The corpus shows high variety in simplification transformations. Omar discusses two use cases. First, evaluating automatic alignment methods using DEPLAIN as a gold standard. The best method for German text simplification is MASSalign. Second, using fine - tuned language models for automatic text simplification. Long - mBART was fine - tuned for document - level simplification, and normal base mBART for sentence - level. These models produced better scores than baseline.

It defines cognitive dissonance as inconsistent beliefs or actions, like a person's smoking habit. Studying it helps understand disagreement effects, track trends, and mental health. The paper describes a large scale annotation of dissonance relations using a dissonance - first approach. However, due to the rarity of dissonance, they use transfer learning and active learning. They transfer weights from related tasks like topic - independent dissonance stance classification and binary classification of expansion and comparison classes. They find that the PRC strategy works best for rare class acquisition. The paper also discusses the feasibility of different strategies for annotation quality and costs. Overall, it shows how to improve dissonance detection using these methods.</sample>

    <sample id="59">The presentation introduces DrBERT, a French biomedical and clinical domain pre - trained model based on RoBERTa and trained on NACHOS. It compares DrBERT with ChuBERT, trained on anonymized data from Nantes University Hospital. Four from - scratch models are trained and compared, using different data sources and pre - training strategies. Seven models are evaluated on tasks like named entity recognition, classification, part - of - speech tagging, and question answering. The evaluation shows that models perform best on tasks with similar data. More data leads to better performance. From - scratch pre - training generally gives higher performance. However, control pre - training using CamemBERT's weight and tokenization on NACHOS subset gives comparable results to DrBERT 4 GB from - scratch. DrBERT outperforms CamemBERT on nine out of eleven downstream tasks.

It focuses on task - specific knowledge distillation for NLG tasks like summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, simplification, and style transfer. The study uses realistic setups with medium - resource labeled data, large unlabeled data, and medium - sized off - the - shelf models. It compares encoder - decoder, decoder - only architectures, and different knowledge selection approaches. The main contributions include showing the importance of unlabeled data in boosting distillation, improving student performance by generating multiple pseudo - targets, and proposing joint - teaching, a novel knowledge distillation technique.

    <sample id="66">The paper "Deep Learning for Mathematical Reasoning" discusses the importance of mathematical reasoning in human intelligence. It focuses on the development of deep learning methods for tasks like solving math problems and proving theorems. It covers two main categories: visual contexts and tabular contexts. For example, in high school education, geometric problems are a key subject. Automated theorem proving is also mentioned. Neural network architectures like sequence - to - sequence models are proposed for mathematical reasoning tasks. Pre - trained language models, such as large language models, are applied to solve math word problems. However, they face limitations like lack of precise mathematical reasoning. Solutions like self - consistency and program - aided LMMs are explored. Mathematical reasoning in low - resource settings and in domains like finance, science, and medicine is also touched upon. The paper highlights the challenges in generalization and robustness of learning models in reasoning tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="67">The study discusses interference in multilingual translation models. It shows that interference can occur when models are small compared to data size. Tuning sampling temperature is key for strong performance. For bilingual cases, model and data size scaling laws can predict loss. In multilingual cases, factors like data size of other languages, language similarity, and total number of languages impact performance. Language similarity and number of languages have less impact. Interference is defined as the relative difference between bilingual and multilingual model losses. Experiments with four Transformer variants and 15 languages from WMT show that severe interference occurs in parameter poverty settings. Tuned temperature is crucial for strong performance. Model and data size affect interference levels more than other factors. Modest scale and tuned temperature can significantly reduce interference without specialized methods.</sample>

It introduces the AltEntities Corpus, which aims to understand users' language when making choices. Indirect references are used when users can't remember names, pronunciations are similar, or they want to specify a preference. The corpus covers music, books, and recipes. It uses a cartoon completion setup with three speech bubbles. The first two are automatically generated, and the third is filled in by annotators. Annotators are shown background knowledge about the entities. Results with T5 XL model show high accuracy with full background knowledge, lower accuracy with partial overlap, and very low accuracy with only entity names. The models are domain - generalizable. The dataset is available for further research.</sample>

The authors propose Rel - CSKGC, a relation prediction model that uses RoBERTa to encode head and tail events and MaxPooling for link prediction. This model avoids sparse graph structure issues and utilizes semantic information. They also design an Intra - and Inter - Cluster Completion Strategy for inference. DenseATOMIC has higher knowledge coverage and more multi - hop paths. It benefits the performance of COMET and has potential for commonsense reasoning.

    <sample id="75">Zheng Yandan presents Jointprop, a joint semi - supervised learning framework for name entity recognition, NER, and relation extraction, RE. They address the lack of interconnections in existing studies. The motivation is to fully exploit connections among labeled and unlabeled data. The framework has four parts: span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. Span features are generated from contextualized representations. A k - Nearest Neighbor graph is constructed for efficiency. Label propagation diffuses labels through the graph. The model is optimized by retraining with pseudo - labels. Experiments on four datasets show that joint learning benefits from codependency in joint datasets and significantly improves over baselines on single - task datasets for both NER and RE tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="76">The political bias propagation pipeline starts from pretraining data, which includes political news media like New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. These are well covered in language model training data. Then, it goes to language models, which can have varying political leanings, occupying all four quadrants on the political campus. For example, GPT-4 is the most liberal language model. Finally, it affects downstream tasks. Language models with different political leanings perform differently on tasks like hate speech detection and fake news detection. Left-leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups but worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups. Right-leaning models are the opposite. This indicates a fairness issue regarding language model political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="77">This work, a joint effort from Yale University and Microsoft Research, introduces the DeFacto dataset for improving summarization factual consistency. It contains human demonstrations and feedback. The dataset is based on the XSum dataset and uses the pre - trained Pegasus model. Around 2. 5K data points were collected, 70% with factual errors. Human - edited summaries have higher automatic factuality scores but lower textual overlap with reference summaries. The work proposes three new NLG tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. Summary editing leverages human feedback effectively. Feedback generation is challenging. For error correction, the editor model performs well with explanation generation. The dataset is valuable for training factuality metrics and meta - evaluation. The DeFacto dataset is available on GitHub.</sample>

    <sample id="82">This video discusses unsupervised automated essay scoring, AES. It points out that state - of - the - art AES models are usually trained with labeled corpora, which is time - consuming and labor - intensive. Two previous works on unsupervised AES are mentioned. The first uses the number of unique terms as an initial score but has poor performance due to uncontrollable clustering. The second uses word count as weak supervision but also has poor performance.The video proposes a novel framework called ULRA for unsupervised AES. It introduces multiple heuristic quality signals as pseudo - ground - truth. A heuristic essay ranking module generates partial - order pairs based on these signals. A deep pairwise rank aggregation module then aggregates these pairs for model training. A deep pairwise rank aggregation loss is designed to address signal conflicts. In experiments, ULRA outperforms unsupervised baselines and achieves competitive performance compared to cross - prompt and one - shot methods.

They propose PAD - Net, a partially dynamic network framework. It partitions parameters into dynamic and static, with scale factors for each. The method uses iterative mode partitioning. Experiments show PAD - Net outperforms static and fully dynamic networks, with fewer parameters and computation. Ablation studies find optimal dynamic ratios. Scale factors are crucial for accuracy. Compared to network pruning, PAD - Net performs better. It makes the output more discriminating.

It conducted a proof - of - concept study using language learners as annotators. They targeted English, Korean, and Indonesian, with tasks like sentiment analysis, NLI, NER, and MRC. Learners were categorized into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. Native speakers were also recruited for comparison. Annotation samples were categorized by difficulty. Learners used additional resources like dictionaries or machine - translation systems. The experiments showed that learners' annotations were nearly accurate, especially for simpler tasks. Aggregated with others, learners' labels were on par with native speakers. Language learners' language proficiency and vocabulary improved through annotation. The study suggests a novel way of data construction by recruiting language learners, broadening NLP research for many languages.</sample>

    <sample id="94">The paper discusses protecting the copyright of embedding as services for large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and PALM. It introduces the background of embedding as services and the problem of attackers stealing models through learning from embeddings. To protect copyright, a backdoor - based watermark method called Embedding marker is proposed. It has two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. In watermark injection, a trigger set is selected, and the provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and original embedding. Copyright verification uses a backdoor and benign data set. Experiments on four data sets show good detection performance and embedding covertness. This method aims to prevent model theft while maintaining embedding utility for downstream tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="100">Multi-hop QA requires multiple reasoning jumps. It involves finding relevant documents in a corpus to answer a question. For example, to find a 1988 Christmas comedy film Brian Doyle - Murray starred in, first find his movies and then the 1988 one. Multi - hop retrievers are trained to maximize the probability of the correct chain given a question. PromptRank is a data - efficient approach that uses an unsupervised retrieval method and a few - shot language model - based reranker. It retrieves candidate chains using TF - IDF and hyperlink traversal, then reranks them. The chain prompt is constructed by inserting chain documents and an indicator token, with an instruction to elicit reasoning. PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and performs well on HotpotQA. It uses GPT2 - XL and T5 - XL and evaluates on R@K recall and answer recall AR@K. PromptRank shows strong few - shot path retrieval performance. The instruction is crucial for eliciting language models' reasoning over chain documents. For more details, check the paper.</sample>

It includes over 3, 000 entity - seeking queries with implicit set constraints. Jane and Austin's examples show how people express information needs with multiple constraints. QUEST uses Wikipedia categories from four domains to create queries. Human annotators paraphrase, validate, and verify entities. Baselines like retrievers and a T5 - based reranker are considered. Results show room for improvement in retriever performance and low end - to - end system F1 scores, especially for set intersection and difference queries. QUEST aims to help build better systems for selective information - seeking scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="107">The multilingual encoder-based models were used in different settings. For example, in the Translate-Test setting, they were trained on one language and then translated to another language using an API like Google Translate, and then used to predict the SQL. In the Monolingual Few-shot setting, they were trained with only 10% of the training data in one language. In the Multilingual Model setting, they were trained on multiple languages together, like German, English, and Chinese, to predict SQL for different languages during inference. And in the Cross-lingual Zero-shot and Few-shot transfer settings, they were trained on one language and then transferred to another language.</sample>
    <sample id="108">The work revisits the minimal pair paradigm for evaluating language models' acceptability judgments. It aims to assess models' acceptability across longer context windows. The authors create longer sequences by adding acceptable or unacceptable sentences as prefixes to existing sentences from datasets like BLiMP and SyntaxGym. They find that MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context length when using Wikipedia sentences. However, when using sentences from the same dataset, judgments significantly change depending on the prefix's acceptability. The models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences. This suggests that current MPP evaluation, with short single - sentence inputs, may not fully capture models' knowledge across the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The work presents Unnatural Instructions, a dataset for instruction tuning. It aims to create a diverse dataset without human labor. A pre - trained language model, a variant of GPT - 3, is prompted to generate instructions and corresponding inputs and outputs. Additional paraphrases are also generated. The dataset contains 64, 000 examples, with about 240, 000 when considering paraphrases. It focuses on creativity, diversity, and correctness. More than 50% of the generated examples are correct. The model fine - tuned on Unnatural Instructions outperforms others on several benchmarks. This shows the potential of language models in producing creative and diverse data, which is difficult and costly for human annotations.</sample>

    <sample id="114">The work introduces a method for optimizing multi - head attention in large language models, focusing on the heavy parameter problem. It proposes a grouped head attention using a divide - and - conquer strategy. The first stage, group - constrained training, divides heads into groups to make intra - group heads similar and inter - group heads separate. The second stage, Voting - to - Stay algorithm, prunes redundant heads within groups. This method achieves significant parameter compression, up to 90% in extreme cases. It performs well on tasks like machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization, with improvements in BLEU and FLOPs. The future work aims to apply task - specific automatic pruning based on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.</sample>

    <sample id="118">The work presents a submission on improving pretraining techniques for code - switched NLP. It defines code - switching as the mixing of languages in a sentence, common in linguistically diverse communities like India. It points out that multilingual pre - trained models like mBERT and XLM - R perform poorly on code - switched tasks. The main contributions are novel MLM techniques, SwitchMLM, and FrequencyMLM. SwitchMLM focuses on masking switch - points, which are transitions between languages in a code - switched sentence. FrequencyMLM uses negative log - likelihood of words in monolingual corpora to assign LID tags. Architectural modifications like residual connections are proposed to encode more switch - point information. The combined method of SwitchMLM, ResBERT, and an auxiliary loss performs best on sentiment analysis tasks. Probing experiments show that the proposed methods increase switch - point information in intermediate and final layers. This abstract summarizes the key aspects of the work.</sample>

    <sample id="123">The research presents MultiInstruct, a multi-modal instruction tuning benchmark dataset. It aims to improve multi-modal zero - shot learning via instruction tuning. The dataset consists of 62 diverse multi - modal tasks from 10 broad categories, derived from 21 existing datasets. OFA is used as the base model. For training, 53 tasks from 9 groups are used, with 10, 000 instances per task. Testing involves the common sense reasoning group and 5 tasks from VQ and Miscellaneous groups. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, Rouge - L, and a new metric called sensitivity. The results show that instruction tuning significantly improves OFA's performance on seen multi - modal tasks. Transfer learning from natural instruction datasets also benefits instruction tuning, reducing sensitivity. The research proposes a large - scale multi - model instruction tuning dataset and explores transfer learning techniques. A larger dataset is being collected for future release.</sample>

They broke down temporal reasoning into three levels: time - to - time, time - to - event, and event - to - event. They found prior works overemphasized L2 reasoning. They conducted a preliminary experiment on L1 year prediction, finding LMs had a bias towards 2000 - 2020. They proposed the TempReason dataset covering all three levels and long temporal coverage. They evaluated in Closed Book QA, Open Book QA, and Reasoning QA settings. They proposed a training strategy with Temporal span extraction pre - training and time - sensitive reinforcement learning. Their TempT5 model outperformed others in OBQA and Reasoning QA. They also noted ChatGPT's performance varies across time periods. Future work could address reasoning biases.</sample>

    <sample id="127">The paper "Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers" by Namgyu Ho, Laura Schmid, and Se - Young Yun addresses the issue of chain - of - thought reasoning being limited to huge models like GPT - 3 and PALM. They propose using these large models as reasoning teachers to transfer their abilities to much smaller models. They introduce a novel technique called diverse reasoning, which generates multiple reasoning samples using stochastic temperature sampling. This allows the small models to perform complex reasoning tasks well. The method is compared with existing baselines on 12 tasks, showing notable performance, especially in text - based ones. Diverse Reasoning significantly increases performance. The method is highly scalable but involves trade - offs between development and inference costs. The paper also discusses how this distillation can transfer other emergent abilities in the future. The code and data from all experiments are provided.</sample>
    <sample id="128">The work presents a diagnostic test suite, KITMUS, for evaluating knowledge integration in natural language understanding models. It focuses on coreference resolution tasks. The test varies the availability of background and entity - specific knowledge. Three settings are defined: Background - Pretrain, Background - Both, and Background - Inference. The Background - Pretrain setting assumes background knowledge at pretrain time. Background - Both provides both types of knowledge at inference time. Background - Inference only has knowledge at inference time. The study shows that without task - specific training, models perform poorly. With training on KITMUS, models like C2F and BERT4Coref perform better. It suggests that models trained on generic data rely on surface cues, which are not useful in KITMUS. Fictional knowledge experiments show that even top models struggle with integrating backward knowledge at inference time. The main takeaway is that many models need task - specific training to integrate knowledge from different sources.</sample>

    <sample id="135">James Finch and Sarah Finch introduce ABC - Eval, a new dimensional approach for evaluating conversational AI. It's developed by the Emory NLP Lab and Amazon Alexa AI. ABC - Eval aims to reduce human evaluation subjectivity by explicitly annotating chat model behaviors. It measures thematic errors like ignoring partners, contradicting, hallucinating, and violating common sense. They evaluated four chat models on 100 human - bot conversations. ABC - Eval labels are more reliable and predictive of conversation quality than existing methods. It can capture unique aspects of chat quality better. Challenges like common sense violations and irrelevant information still exist. ABC - Eval is a step forward in evaluating conversational AI with higher resolution. It's hoped to be used by others in the field.</sample>

    <sample id="137">The paper introduces Tell2Design, a dataset for language - guided floor plan generation. It aims to enable users to design floor plans by "telling" instructions. The task is defined as generating 2D floor plan designs from language instructions that specify semantics, geometry, and topology. The dataset is constructed using publicly available floor plans and human - annotated language instructions, with over 5, 000 human - annotated and 76, 000 artificially generated instructions. The main challenges are strict constraints, understanding the big picture from unstructured text, and dealing with ambiguous information. A sequence - to - sequence model based on the encoder - decoder framework is proposed, initialized by a pre - trained language model. The model outperforms text - conditional image generation baselines in terms of IoU scores. The paper concludes by proposing this as a foundation for future research on language - guided design generation.</sample>

    <sample id="146">Yicheng, a PhD student from Fudan University, gives a talk on the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization. Dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization, aiming to create concise summaries. It has made progress with large - scale pretrained language models, but still has factual errors like omission. Omission is a major factor in poor quality summaries. The study analyzes the omission rate across five domains and six models, finding a high rate of about 70%. Omission is randomly distributed in dialogues. To better analyze and solve the problem, they define omission detection, focusing on utterance - level omission. They construct the OLDS dataset for this purpose, using five existing benchmarks. They explore three frameworks as baselines and use Precision, Recall, and F1 - score for evaluation. Post - editing with detected omissions improves summary quality. This shows omission detection is valuable for quality improvement in dialogue summarization.</sample>

They highlight the vast amount of meeting transcripts as a new NLP research domain. Meeting transcripts are long, domain - specific, and rich in information. Prior works mainly focus on summarization and action item extraction, underutilizing the QA component. MeetingQA is introduced as an extractive QA dataset based on questions and answers in meeting transcripts. It has a high inter - annotator agreement. The dataset contains 7.7K questions, 30% unanswerable, 40% multispan answers, and 48% multi - speaker answers. Questions are mostly yes - no, rhetorical, or opinion - seeking. The length of questions and answers is roughly 12 and 35 words, respectively. The paper employs various methods like context - retrieval, single - span, and multi - span models. Fine - tuned models have a 25 F1 point gap from human performance. Short - context models outperform long - context models. Zero - shot performance has a 50 F1 point gap from human performance.

    <sample id="153">Ninareh Mehrabi, a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Alexa AI's Responsible AI team, presented their work on resolving ambiguities in text - to - image generative models. They studied ambiguous prompts provided to text - to - image models, like "The girl enters the room with flowers, " which can be interpreted in different ways. Their goal was to propose frameworks to mitigate ambiguities and evaluate faithful image generation.To achieve this, they first curated a benchmark dataset covering various types of ambiguities. Then, they used a prompt disambiguation framework. In one setup, the language model generated clarifying questions, and in another, it generated different possible visual setups. After disambiguating the prompts, they evaluated the generated images' faithfulness to user intention using an automatic evaluation framework based on a VQA model. Their findings showed that disambiguation had a positive effect on faithful generation and that their automatic evaluation framework agreed with human evaluation. This work aims to improve text - to - image models' ability to generate images according to user intention.</sample>

Dialogue summarization aims to distill salient info from a dialogue context into a concise summary. Existing methods mainly use pre - computed static graph structures but have drawbacks like relying on unreliable external tools and not being able to adapt dynamically. Their SDDS model has four components. It uses an Utterance Encoder, constructs static graphs, proposes a Static - Dynamic Graph module, and employs a pre - trained language model as the Summary Generator. They use four heuristic methods for dialogue structure modeling, capture utterance position info, and propose a Dynamic Graph module for semantic relationship capture. To integrate static and dynamic graphs, they use a fusion method. The code and data are released on GitHub.</sample>
    <sample id="158">The speaker, Qipeng Guo from AWS, introduces the task of coreference resolution in long documents. It aims to link mentions referring to the same entity. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity, while cache - based methods reduce it to linear. However, LRU eviction in long documents with topic switches leads to high cache misses. The speaker proposes a dual cache with a local cache using LRU and a global cache using LFU. The model classifies mentions and adds them to the appropriate cache based on frequency. Evaluation on benchmarks shows dual cache outperforms single cache methods, reducing cache misses and having a higher performance - cost ratio. It's the most cost - effective compared to single cache methods.</sample>

    <sample id="165">The paper presents an approach to abductive reasoning without supervision. It starts with a context and an outcome, and a set of possible explanations. The goal is to find a plausible explanation that bridges the gap. The authors introduce LiPoR, an unsupervised learning method. It treats explanations as a latent variable. The objective is to maximize the likelihood of the outcome given the context. However, to prefer plausible explanations, a regularizer is needed. This regularizer enforces mutual exclusivity among explanations. LiPoR outperforms other models on the AlphaNLI dataset, including a strong zero - shot GPT - 3 baseline, by over 4 absolute points in accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="166">The work introduces a new framework for image retrieval from linguistically complex text. It addresses the challenge of highly similar images and long descriptions. The framework is inspired by Divide - and - Conquer and Dual - Process Theory. It uses a Proposition Generator to decompose complex propositions into simple ones. The Visual - Linguistic Interactor performs visual - proposition interaction, similar to System 1. The Neural - Symbolic Reasoner, as System 2, integrates reasoning states and results of simple propositions. The method combines the advantages of analogical inference and logical reasoning. Experimental results show that the proposed method, NDCR, outperforms baselines. It also verifies the effectiveness of each module through abolition experiments. The work suggests that neural symbolic calculation could improve compositional reasoning and planning in large language models. Divide - and - Conquer and Dual - Process Theory are effective for complex problem solving.</sample>

    <sample id="205">Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, presents research on political biases in language models. Language models are trained on large web crawl data, including well - covered political news media like New York Times and Los Angeles Times. This creates a mixed blessing. On one hand, diverse perspectives are learned, celebrating democracy. On the other hand, social biases might lead to fairness issues in downstream tasks.The study investigates the political bias propagation pipeline. It evaluates language models' political leanings using political questionnaires and finds that GPT - 4 is the most liberal. It also explores how different political leanings affect performance on downstream tasks like hate speech and fake news detection. Left - leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting minorities but worse for powerful groups. Right - leaning models show the opposite. The research highlights a pressing fairness issue regarding language model political leanings, warning of potential marginalization of people with opposite political opinions. It also discusses the dilemma of sanitizing political opinions in training data to avoid bias propagation while risking censorship or exclusion.</sample>

This tendency grows with the length difference between conjuncts. When the governor is on the right, this effect disappears. The paper provides evidence from the enhanced Penn Treebank and shows how this supports symmetric structures of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="217">The work "Seen to Unseen: Exploring Compositional Generalization of Multi-Attribute Controllable Dialogue Generation" by Weihao Zeng et al. focuses on multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation. It addresses limitations of previous methods, which often focus on single attributes or lack unified evaluation metrics. The authors propose DCG, a Disentangled Controllable Generation model. DCG learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses disentanglement loss. They introduce a unified reference - free evaluation framework, MAE, for different attribute granularities. Experiments show DCG outperforms baselines in attribute controllability and text equality. The model uses DialoGPT framework with compositional prompt modules. Attribute - oriented and task - oriented prompts are designed to guide the model. A unified evaluation framework is proposed to handle multi - attribute controllable dialogue generation without large - scale labeled data. The method is evaluated on DailyDialog - CG and compared to other metrics. The results confirm its effectiveness in compositional generalization.</sample>

The work focuses on the Form 10 - K annual report required by the SEC. It observes that 80% of tokens in consecutive years are similar, motivating a highlighting task and pipeline. The task aims to find rationale words between target and reference reports. The pipeline has stages like document segmentation, relation recognition, and fine - tuning. Stage 1 classifies pairs into three types: β, revised, and mismatched. For fine - tuning, an external dataset and revised pairs are used. Evaluation metrics include precision and PCC. The model achieves good performance on the FINAL dataset and shows potential in handling mismatched pairs. Future work includes improving effectiveness and adding more features.</sample>

    <sample id="222">This work focuses on challenges and interventions for domain adaptation in open - domain question answering. It discusses the need to look up relevant passages from a document corpus like Wikipedia and how this can be problematic when trying to answer questions in different domains, such as biomedical. The work makes three main contributions: investigating data interventions for out - of - domain generalization, identifying dataset shift types, and determining effective data interventions for specific shifts. It uses zero - shot and few - shot methods for data interventions. For zero - shot, it controls interactions among question, answer, and context. For few - shot, it uses examples from the target domain to prompt large language models. The work also measures compatibility between source and target datasets to estimate the type of dataset shift. It finds that few - shot adaptations are effective for most target datasets, while zero - shot adaptations work well for datasets with concept and covariate shifts. Overall, it improves reader performance by up to 24% through various data interventions.</sample>

    <sample id="227">Grounded language understanding is lacking in current language models. It aims to map natural language expressions into executable plans or programs in specific environments. Challenges include lack of grounding during pre - training. Existing research often uses language models for direct plan generation, which may not always be grammatical or valid. A novel framework called Pangu is proposed. It focuses on discrimination rather than generation. A symbolic agent proposes candidate plans, and a language model scores and ranks them. Pangu shows strong performance across different language models and settings, including fine - tuning and in - context learning. It has good sample efficiency and robustness under non - i.i.d. settings. The key takeaway is that discrimination might be a better strategy for grounded language understanding than generation.</sample>

    <sample id="229">The paper presents a study on detecting improvable claims for argumentative writing support. It starts by introducing the importance of text revision in professional writing, especially in argumentative writing. The authors then discuss two tasks: Suboptimal - Claim detection and Claim Improvement Suggestion. They explore challenges in working with revision - based data, such as representativity and reliability, model complexity and architecture, dependence on contextual information, and topical and user bias. The study concludes that revision - based data can be effectively used for the tasks and that modeling the distance between claim versions is helpful for detecting suboptimal claims. Contextual information's impact on quality detection varies depending on the task and quality issues. For more details, refer to the paper.</sample>

    <sample id="233">Simultaneous speech translation, SimulST, is translating spoken language into text in another language in real time. Current models have problems like long training procedures and need different models for different latency. The paper proposes EDAtt, Encoder - Decoder Attention. It uses existing offline ST models without re - training. It decides whether to emit partial translation based on attention. If the sum of cross - attention is below a certain threshold, it emits a word. The results show it outperforms other strategies in terms of translation quality and latency.

    <sample id="241">The paper discusses the evaluation of early misinformation detection systems, especially for COVID - 19 treatments. It points out that current systems often have unrealistic evaluations and are not human - centric. The authors propose a human - in - the - loop evaluation framework. Their system has two main components: one for detecting misleading claims and another for policy violation verification. For claim detection, it uses keyword filtering and a T5 model for claim extraction. For policy violation verification, a BERT - based model is used. The paper evaluates the early detection of unapproved treatments and the policy violation verification part. It finds that the system has a high efficacy in detecting policy violations and that a large number of violations can be detected per human hour worked. The work aims to motivate future development of human - in - the - loop misinformation detection systems and provides an industry - outside perspective on misinformation detection system development and evaluation.</sample>

It starts with qualification settings, including pre - task qualifications like location, number of HITs, and HIT Approval Rate. The first qualification task tests annotators' ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly, categorizing them into gold, silver, bronze, and block. Only gold and silver workers pass. The second endurance task assesses capacity for handling heavy workload. The reference - based task tests general performance on true annotation tasks. The pipeline results in 4 gold and 8 silver workers out of 200. It serves as a best practice for high - agreement annotations at large scale and lower cost, avoiding resource waste. Limitations include only English summarization on MTurk, non - "panacea" questions, no guarantee of correctness training, and the work was funded by Google.</sample>

It aims to help legal professionals like lawyers and judges find relevant past precedents. The work has two key contributions: the IL - PCR dataset and the U - CREAT pipeline.The IL - PCR dataset is a benchmark for prior case retrieval tasks, containing 7, 070 legal cases with an average of 6. 775 citations per query document. The U - CREAT pipeline uses unsupervised learning and an event - based approach. It extracts events from case documents using dependency parsing and then computes an interaction matrix between query and candidate events for ranking.The method was tested with various models, including count - based, transformer - based, and event - based models. Event - based models, especially the Event Filtered Documents model, performed best, outperforming other methods in terms of F1 scores and inference times. U - CREAT is currently the state - of - the - art method for the COLIEE'21 document retrieval task. It opens up new avenues for prior case retrieval research.</sample>
    <sample id="253">The work "DisorBERT: A Double Domain Adaptation Model for Detecting Signs of Mental Disorders in Social Media" is a collaborative effort by researchers from Mexico and Spain. It defines mental disorders as psychological syndromes causing distress and disability. Social media is a vast resource for studying mental health issues. The aim is to automatically analyze social media posts to detect mental health disorders, supporting early warning and evidence. Domain adaptation is used to improve model performance on specific domains like Reddit and mental health, using knowledge from general data sources like Wikipedia and Google Books. The proposed approach involves learning social media language first and then specializing in the mental disorder domain. Guided masking focuses on important words during training. Results on the eRisk datasets show DisorBERT's good balance in precision and recall compared to baselines. Examples from the Beck's Depression Inventory demonstrate DisorBERT's bias towards mental disorder - related words. The work concludes that double domain adaptation and guided masking are effective. Future work includes exploring different lexical resources and using clinical data.</sample>

A pre - denoising DocRE model is trained with both DS and human - annotated data to generate pseudo labels. Uncertainty estimation is introduced to determine the trustworthiness of model predictions. An instance - level uncertainty estimation method is proposed for overlapping relations. A re - labeling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds is designed to filter pseudo labels with high uncertainty. A multi - phase training strategy is also developed to iteratively re - label DS data. The framework outperforms several strong baselines on public datasets. The main contributions include the uncertainty - guided label denoising framework, instance - level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations, iterative re - labeling with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds, and great performance improvements.</sample>

The work uses large language models like T0, InstructGPT, and ChatGPT to rate stories based on grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance. Human English teachers are used as a ground - truth for comparison. The results show that some large language models, like Davinci and ChatGPT, can provide meaningful ratings similar to human evaluators. The video also mentions that the paper answers questions about the agreement between large language models and human evaluators, the impact of instruction wordings and sampling responses, and the benefits and costs of using large language models for evaluation compared to human evaluation.

It identifies three types of label biases: vanilla - label bias, context - label bias, and domain - label bias. Experiments show that random in - domain words from the task corpus can bias model predictions, while random English words don't. A novel domain - context calibration method is proposed. It uses random in - domain words to estimate and calibrate the model's bias on label names. This method outperforms previous calibration attempts. It improves in - context learning performance, especially on tasks with large domain - label bias. The study concludes with a systematic investigation of label bias problems and a proposed calibration method for large language models. For more details, check the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="264">Lin Wang, a Zhejiang University grad student, presents his paper "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio - Visual Text Generation". He notes that uni - model text gen tasks like machine translation and image captioning have advanced due to large - scale pre - training and big models. However, multimodal text gen tasks like audio - visual text gen face challenges like arduous and expensive data annotation and severe degradation due to domain shifts.In response, he proposes Transferable Audio - Visual Text Generation. The main challenge is multi - modal domain shifts like visual style and audio energy. He posits that a unified audio semantic space can align visual concepts across domains. His framework has three components: an audio - visual meta - mapper network, an encoder and language model generator, and counterfactual contrastive learning. The meta - mapper network maps visual concepts into a unified audio semantic space. The encoder and generator use a transformer - based approach with an alpha to evaluate modality contribution. A Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning is proposed to optimize visual - textual alignment. In experiments, TAVT outperforms SOTA models on cross - datasets and cross - domain settings, even on low - resource domains. Ablation experiments show the impact of audio features on performance.</sample>

It focuses on translations in the other direction, which is understudied. Five Indian languages, Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati, are studied. From the Flores dataset, 200 sentences are randomly selected and fed to seven translation models or APIs, generating 1, 400 candidate translations for each language. Bilingual expert annotators evaluate these translations, marking errors, their types, severity, and providing an overall score. Error types are classified into accuracy - based, fluency - based, and special category errors. Metrics like chrF, LabSE embedding, and COMET - metric variants are compared. COMET - metric variants show the highest overall correlations. IndicCOMET MQM, fine - tuned using the MQM dataset, outperforms COMET baselines on three out of five languages and across all languages. IndicCOMET MQM also performs better on unseen languages and is more robust than COMET on the ACES Translation Accuracy Challenge Sets.</sample>

It addresses challenges in existing methods like underexploiting multimodal information complementarity, poor performance on minority emotion classes, and difficulty distinguishing semantically similar emotions. MultiEMO consists of unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion, and emotion classification. VisExtNet is proposed for visual feature extraction, capturing facial expressions without redundant scene information. MultiAttn is a multimodal fusion model using bidirectional multi - head cross - attention layers. Sample - Weighted Focal Contrast loss is introduced to handle minority and semantically similar emotion classes. Extensive experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP show state - of - the - art performance. Limitations include VisExtNet not distinguishing speakers and irrelevant people, SWFC loss needing a large batch size on MELD, and worse performance in minority emotions compared to majority classes.</sample>

It shows how context changes the meaning of words, like "mole" in different sentences. The work measures context dependence using CXMI and its extended version, Pointwise CXMI. It analyzes words with high P - CXMI in TED talk transcripts translated into 14 languages. The findings are used to create a Multilingual Discourse - Aware, MuDA, tagger for document - level translation. The MuDA tagger helps identify discourse phenomena. When evaluated with different metrics, context - aware models perform better for some phenomena but not others. DeepL is more accurate than Google Translate for document - level translation. This work provides insights into when context is crucial in translation and how to evaluate translation models better.</sample>

This work focuses on story - level style transfer, which is a step forward from token - or sentence - level studies. The main challenge is imitating author - specific discourse - level linguistic choices, like narrative techniques and styles associated with writing topics. To address this, StoryTrans is proposed. It learns discourse representations from source texts and combines them with style embeddings. A new training objective reduces stylistic features from discourse representations and enhances content preservation through two - stage generation. The first stage transfers source text with masked style - specific content keywords, and the second stage fills in correct style - specific contents. Extensive experiments on Chinese and English datasets show StoryTrans outperforms baselines in style control and content preservation. It can supplement short phrases to enrich storylines and rewrite sentences while maintaining source semantics. The data and code are available in the repo.</sample>

It proposes a fuzzy span mechanism to handle ambiguity in span boundaries and adaptively adjust attention span for better span extraction. Experiments on named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction show FSUIE's improved performance compared to UIE - base.

    <sample id="285">The work "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine - grained Evaluation Framework" by Mingqi Gao from Peking University focuses on factual errors in dialogue summaries. It discusses two main solutions: introducing factuality - related objectives in the training or inference process and designing an independent Factual Error Correction, FEC, model. FEC models are evaluated using factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE, but these have flaws. The authors argue that introducing manually annotated reference corrections can address these issues. They propose a new taxonomy of factual errors and build an evaluation framework based on ERRANT. Key findings include that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yields better results than unreliable factuality metrics. Human - corrected summaries during training can improve performance, and combining human - annotated data with synthetic data is promising. Current FEC models struggle with certain types of factual errors.</sample>

They developed the EPIC corpus, collecting data from social media sources like Reddit and Twitter over 1.5 years. About 300 short conversations were collected for five English varieties. Crowdsourcing platform Prolific was used for annotation by 74 annotators. An annotation interface was simple, asking if a reply was ironic. Differences in inter - annotator agreement were observed based on various dimensions like gender, age group, and nationality. Perspective - aware models were built by fine - tuning a pre - trained language model on different annotator splits. While raw performance didn't show clear trends, perspective - aware models showed more confidence in their predictions. Interesting findings were made about age and geographical distribution of annotators affecting annotation differences.</sample>

    <sample id="299">The work discusses improving NLI model robustness by addressing shortcuts. It points out that NLI models rely on shortcuts due to spurious correlations in datasets. These shortcuts lead to good performance on in - distribution but poor on out - of - distribution. Existing shortcut mitigation methods have limitations like requiring domain - specific knowledge and assuming learner - auxiliary similarity. The proposed minimax training method aims to reduce reliance on shortcuts. It focuses on hard examples that counteract dominant easy examples. The learner and auxiliary are trained alternately to optimize example weights. The method shows consistent improvement in out - of - distribution performance across datasets like MNLI, FEVER, and QQP. It doesn't assume shortcut types and uses a feed - forward network for the auxiliary. The abstract ends by inviting discussion during a poster session.</sample>

It involves dictating, making corrections, and issuing commands to edit. Most existing speech - to - text systems only support dictation and not editing through vocal commands. The work introduces interactive dictation as a new task, formalizes it as a four - step procedure, and builds a dataset for it. A baseline system is created, with separate models for ASR recognition, segmentation, command extraction, and execution. The models are trained using different architectures and outputs. GPT - 3 models are more accurate but slower, while T5 models show less distinction between predicting programs and states. There's room for improvement in this task.

    <sample id="305">Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University, presents their work on "Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning." They discuss weak supervision and weakly supervised learning. Weak supervision uses weak labeling sources like heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or crowdsourcing. These labels are cheaper but noisy. In weakly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to handle label noise. Recent WSL works claim high performance on clean test sets but often assume access to a clean validation set. The study finds that clean validation samples are necessary for WSL to work well. Increasing clean validation samples improves performance. Direct fine - tuning on clean data can outperform WSL approaches. The study recommends reporting model selection criteria, comparing with few - shot learning baselines, and considering continuous fine - tuning as a baseline. The code is open - sourced.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim present an overview of their work on entity tracking in language models. They argue that for an agent to understand a discourse, it must track entities and their state changes. They face challenges in designing a task to evaluate entity state tracking abilities, like the model might predict correct states from pre - training data or simple associations. They designed a task involving boxes and objects, where the model has to predict box contents after state - changing operations. Their experiments with models like Flan - T5 and GPT - 3 show that only text - davinci - 003 exhibits non - trivial tracking. They find that pre - training on code is crucial for this ability in large language models. Smaller models can learn with direct fine - tuning, but randomly initialized ones can't. They encourage readers to check their paper for more results and analysis.</sample>

    <sample id="308">Jenny, a first - year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, presents a work on NLPositionality, characterizing design biases of datasets and models. This work, in collaboration with others, aims to study the positionality of NLP researchers and model developers. It discusses how design biases can occur due to the perspectives of researchers and how datasets and models can represent certain positionalities over others. The study uses a framework called NLPositionality to compare annotations with real users and existing datasets and models. It finds that there is positionality in NLP, with datasets and models being most aligned to English - speaking countries and people with a college education. It also notes that some populations are inevitably left behind. Recommendations include keeping a record of design choices, doing NLP research with a perspectivist lens, and building specialized datasets and models within specific communities.</sample>

    <sample id="316">The findings show that T5 fine - tuned on CoScript can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models. This indicates that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable datasets. So, it implies that smaller models like T5 can be a good alternative for constrained language planning tasks. If you have any other questions about this, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="317">Peng Li from Fudan University presents "CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information Extractors". Information extraction aims to extract structured info from unstructured text. Previous models like T5 and GPT - 3 use text - to - text pre - training but have mismatched outputs. CodeIE transforms text - to - structured extraction into structure - to - structure code generation. For named entity recognition, a function is defined to extract entities. For relation extraction, similar prompts are designed. Evaluated on datasets, CodeIE using Codex outperforms traditional models like UIE and GPT - 3 in few - shot tasks. Code format prompts show better recall. CodeIE aligns better with information extraction task and avoids structural errors. The analysis provides insights for information extraction.</sample>

    <sample id="322">Enrico is presenting at ACL 23 on "What does a Text Classifier Learn about Morality?". He explains that morality is what helps distinguish right from wrong in human society. Morality is subjective, with different people labeling concepts like abortion or LGBTQ rights differently. The Moral Foundation Theory suggests five ways humans perceive morality, each prioritized differently by individuals. Language models can understand morality in text, but it's important to understand how morality is expressed differently across domains. Using the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus, they explore if language models can recognize these differences. For example, ALM and BLM have similar topics but differ in how they express the moral element of subversion. Language models can recognize that in ALM, subversion is frowned upon, while in BLM, it's somewhat encouraged. This shows that morality is expressed differently in different domains, and using one model for many domains can lead to misunderstandings.</sample>
    <sample id="323">Yujie Wang from Shanxi University presents a paper on "Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense QA". It addresses the challenges in Commonsense QA, like noisy entities during subgraph retrieval and limited interaction between modalities. The proposed DHLK builds an HKG based on multiple knowledge bases through a two - stage pruning strategy and KRL. It uses RoBERTa and Mask Self - Attention to encode and fuse QA contexts and entities, and dynamically removes weakly relevant entities. HKG is optimized with TransE. Relation Mask Self - Attention is used to model subgraphs, and the HKG graph embedding is obtained by max - pooling. The HKG path information is incorporated into the QA context for path enhancement. The method is evaluated on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA, showing good results compared to other LM and HKG methods.</sample>

    <sample id="333">The work introduces INK, a framework for injecting kNN knowledge into nearest neighbor machine translation. It aims to improve NMT model generalization and performance. The core idea is to smooth predictions based on nearest neighbors in the representation space. The framework has two steps: extracting kNN knowledge to guide adapter adjustment and updating representations asynchronously. It optimizes the adapter with a combined learning objective. Experiments show INK outperforms state - of - the - art kNN - MT systems, achieving higher BLEU scores with less memory and faster inference. It also explores how kNN knowledge affects representation distribution and the benefits of using an adapter and datastore together. Overall, INK enhances NMT model representation space and translation performance.</sample>

    <sample id="337">The research presents a method for handling out - of - vocabulary, OOV, words in context - free word embedding learning. It uses a Word Relationship Graph based on word formation and association. When an OOV word appears, it's tokenized and associated with relevant words. A self - attention network assigns attributes to OOV nodes. Two levels of Graph Attention Network are used to extract important information. A readout block layer summarizes the graph. A simple Graph Convolutional Network is applied. Contrastive learning is used in the loss function. The model outperforms baselines in intrinsic and extrinsic tasks. It can benefit static and contextual models. Agglutinative languages are well - suited, but fusional languages present more challenges. The model's performance with English is good through reasonable word segmentation. The graph in the model can handle various complex word formations. The application to other languages depends on rational word decomposition.</sample>
    <sample id="338">The research titled "Are Human Explanations Always Helpful? Towards Objective Evaluation of Human Natural Language Explanations" is a collaborative work from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research. It aims to evaluate the quality of human explanations for machine learning models. The study addresses the subjective and task - dependent nature of human explanations. It introduces a unified data format and evaluates five datasets using two models, T5 and BART. A novel metric called TREU is proposed, which extends the simulatability score to evaluate the helpfulness of explanations at fine - tuning. The research shows that human - annotated explanations can still benefit model predictions even if considered low quality by humans. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed metric outperforms the simulatability score. This work lays the foundation for high - quality human collaboration in annotation jobs.</sample>

    <sample id="340">Kuan - Hao Huang from UCLA presents ParaAMR, a large - scale syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset. It aims to overcome limitations of existing datasets like MRPC, PAN, and Quora in terms of scale and syntactic diversity. ParaAMR uses AMR graphs to generate paraphrases. A pre - trained AMR parser gets the graph of a source sentence. Then, the focus of the graph is changed, and the text is generated from the modified graph. ParaAMR has around 15 million source sentences with 6. 9 paraphrases per sentence. Compared to other back - translation datasets, ParaAMR has higher syntactic diversity while maintaining semantic similarity. It benefits NLP applications like learning sentence embeddings, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few - shot learning. The dataset is available at a given link.</sample>

    <sample id="342">The paper presents LiveChat, a large - scale personalized dialogue dataset. It introduces open - domain dialogue and existing datasets. The key challenge is constructing a large - scale video - sourced dataset. LiveChat is constructed from Chinese TikTok/Douyin videos. It has three steps: extracting audio, transcribing, and collecting audience comments. The persona information is manually labeled and extracted by rules and classifiers. Compared to other datasets, LiveChat is video - sourced, has a larger scale, and longer average sessions. Experiments show persona and longer sessions are beneficial for response modeling. For addressee recognition, single - stream BERT outperforms double - stream BERT. BART performs better than other models. The paper concludes with future work on efficient transfer learning of LLMs for LiveChat.</sample>

    <sample id="345">The paper introduces a method for compositional generalization in semantic parsing without using trees. It shows a neural seq2seq model that directly models input - output correspondences. The model tags input tokens with multiset tags and then uses another model to predict a permutation for the output. This approach allows for strong generalization to deeper recursion. The paper addresses challenges like alignment between input and output and finding linguistically correct permutations. It outperforms other treeless models on the COGS benchmark.

    <sample id="348">The paper "Marked Personas" by Myra, Esin Durmus, and Dan Jurafsky aims to measure stereotypes in large language models, LLMs. It addresses limitations of existing measures, like time - consuming hand - constructed data sets and limited generalization. The authors use instruction - tuned LLMs to generate personas based on prompts. They find that while the generated personas contain more stereotypes than human - written ones, the distribution of words differs. Positive - seeming words like "culture" and "proud" reflect harmful patterns. The paper reveals how seemingly positive portrayals contribute to discrimination and othering. It recommends researchers address positive stereotypes and use an intersectional lens. Increased transparency about bias mitigation methods is also suggested.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The paper "What’s the Meaning of Superhuman Performance in Today’s NLU?" by Simone Tedeschi and others discusses the concept of superhuman performance in NLU. It points out that while systems can achieve high leaderboard scores on benchmarks, it's unclear what it means to outperform humans in tasks involving knowledge, reasoning, and inference. The paper analyzes two popular benchmarks, SuperGLUE and SQuAD, and finds that humans are outperformed on most tasks. However, it also identifies several sources of error in these comparisons, such as different evaluation sets for humans and systems and errors in ground - truth answers. The paper argues that claims of superhuman performance are not yet grounded due to issues like low pay rates for humans and lack of information about the annotator pool. It recommends avoiding these mistakes and constructing more reliable benchmarks.</sample>
    <sample id="351">The paper investigates the generalization of CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers in 2023. It observes that these models have been used for almost 20 years and raises questions about their generalization to modern data and what is needed for good generalization. The authors developed the CoNLL++ Dataset from Reuters News 2020 and fine - tuned over 20 models on CoNLL - 03 test sets and CoNLL++. They found that for good generalization, a better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine - tuning examples are needed. The performance drop is mainly caused by temporal drift, not adaptive overfitting. The conclusion is that CoNLL - 2003 taggers still work well in 2023. The paper calls for more research on improving model generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" addresses the challenge of input underspecification in code generation. It identifies that state - of - the - art methods fail to handle this issue well. The authors propose using interaction, specifically asking clarification questions, to alleviate underspecification. They create a synthetic dataset, CodeClarQA, with clarifications on key operations. A pipeline of code generation by asking clarification questions is proposed. The paper also discusses the process of identifying missing key operations and the errors encountered. It presents a clarification - need predictor, question selector, and code generator module. The results show that the task is more challenging than existing CQ ranking tasks but clarifications help code generation. The authors also analyze whether clarified key operations lead to better generated code and provide examples. They invite feedback on their paper and code.</sample>

    <sample id="361">Armineh Nourbakhsh, a PhD student and research director, presents "CounterComp". It focuses on using counterfactual scenarios to improve compositional generalization for multi - step quantitative reasoning in question - answering tasks. State - of - the - art models struggle with more than two - step outputs due to memorizing spurious patterns. CounterComp mines counterfactual scenarios from training samples. It treats a sample as an anchor and finds positive and negative examples. Positive examples have no change in output with intervention, negative ones do. An auxiliary metric learning loss is added, with a dynamic margin. This improves performance on in - and out - of - distribution samples, especially when reasoning steps exceed two. It also helps the model attend to meaningful tokens related to output operations. For more info, check the poster or contact listed.</sample>
