The multi-model approach, which uses different models for different samples, outperforms early-exit models by 2.3% on average. The gap between early-exit and multi-model methods is largest for early classifiers. The SWEET method, which separates weights in early-exit transformers, closes most of the gap between EE and MM. Later classifiers are negatively affected by the SWEET method. The existence of conflicting gradients in the early-exit training process is noted, with future classifiers' gradients aligned, hinting at similar goals. The SWEET method is favored for high speedups in early-exit models and can be applied to other exit strategies, architectures, and fine-tuning methods. The SWEET method motivates future research in fine-tuning algorithms tailored to the early-exit architecture.</sample>

The presentation begins with an introduction to multi-hop question answering, highlighting the need for multiple reasoning steps to answer complex questions. It then delves into retriever training, explaining that retrievers are typically trained to maximize the probability of ground-truth chains given questions. The presentation also touches on the challenges of existing systems requiring thousands of examples for good performance, which can be expensive, especially in low-resource domains and languages.

The main focus of the presentation is on PromptRank, an approach that combines an unsupervised retrieval method with a few-shot language model-based reranker. The presentation outlines two main steps: retrieving a pool of candidate chains using TF-IDF retrieval and hyperlink traversal, and reranking these chains using the few-shot language model reranker. The scoring function used is the likelihood of the question given the chain according to an LM.

The presentation also discusses additional techniques such as instruction ensembling and temperature scaling. It emphasizes the importance of constructing the chain prompt effectively and mentions the use of a language model for scoring the likelihood of the question given the chain.

    <sample id="353">The paper presents a method for identifying missing key operations in natural language descriptions of code. The method uses a combination of clarification questions and a synthetic dataset to gather more specifications, alleviating the problem of underspecification. The approach introduces interactivity into code generation, focusing on clarifying operation-level specifications. The method is evaluated on a synthetic dataset and outperforms existing models. The paper also discusses challenges and potential directions for improvement, such as handling highly-ranked CQs and improving the interaction paradigm.</sample>

    <sample id="361">The audio discusses a presentation on a metric learning method using counterfactual examples called CounterComp. It highlights how CounterComp improves performance on in-distribution samples and enhances model robustness against out-of-distribution samples. The presenter explains that CounterComp addresses the long-tail issue by focusing on the most frequent program steps, which leads to better generalization. The method is shown to outperform other models like FinQANet and CompAQT in terms of accuracy. The presenter also mentions that CounterComp can be used to generate counterfactual examples, which can be beneficial for training models. Additionally, the audio touches on the importance of using questions as counterfactual examples to improve the model's ability to generalize.</sample>
