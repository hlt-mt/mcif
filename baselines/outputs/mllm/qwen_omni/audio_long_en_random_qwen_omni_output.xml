The authors introduce LayoutMAsk, a novel multi - pre - training model. Instead of global 1D projection, it uses local 1D projection. LayoutMAsk uses text and layout information as input. It has three differences from previous studies: 1D projection choice, masking strategy, and pre - training objectives. It aims to enhance text - layout interactions and layout representation learning. The experiments show LayoutMAsk performs well on SPOT and SRE datasets, with some performance differences between local and global 1D projection.</sample>

    <sample id="6">John presents their work on unifying multilingual and cross - lingual summarization. They unify various summarization tasks into a many - to - many setting. This allows a single model to summarize a document in any source language and generate a summary in any target language. They conduct preliminary studies to compare multilingual, cross - lingual, and many - to - many summarization. They find that many - to - many summarization helps transfer task knowledge better across languages. They propose a pre - training method for the many - to - many model, named PACTS, which learns language modeling, cross - lingual ability, and summarization ability through a three - stage pre - training. They show the differences between multilingual, cross - lingual, and many - to - many summarization. They conduct experiments on the WikiNews dataset and find that the many - to - many summarization model outperforms others. They also conduct ablation studies and human studies to show the effectiveness of PACTS. So, this work is really interesting and has great potential.

He talks about large language models' ability to generate and explain jokes. For example, ChatGPT can tell a joke like "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything." However, it struggles with explaining jokes well. The New Yorker Caption Contest data is used for three tasks: matching, quality ranking, and explanation generation. The best model achieves around 62% accuracy on matching, which is far behind human performance. Models like GPT-4 also perform poorly when given human - authored image descriptions. This shows a big gap in humor understanding between humans and language models.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presents his work on adaptive inference in low - resource settings. Adaptive inference reduces inference time of large language models by using low - capacity models for easy samples. Two common methods are multi - model and early exit. Multi - model stores multiple models with classifiers, while early exit fits classifiers at intermediate layers. Multi - model is versatile but expensive and has overhead. Early exit is faster and memory - efficient but can suffer from lower performance due to conflicting gradients. The study shows that multi - model classifiers outperform early exit classifiers by an average of 2.3% for BERT base and large. Sweet is a novel finetuning method for early exit architectures that avoids conflicting gradients. It closes most of the gap between early exit and multi - model but can negatively affect later classifiers in some cases.</sample>

To solve these, a graph information bottlenecks - guided feature refinement is proposed. Then, multimodal topic information is considered as additional semantic supplementary. The method consists of five parts: representing text and image with visual and textual syngraphs, merging them into a unified backbone cross - model graph, screening the initial graph, enriching compressed features with multimodal topic features, and evaluating on a widely used MRE dataset. It shows better performance than text - based methods and other multimodal baselines. The internal information screening and external information exploitation are important under different text - visual relevance scores.</sample>

Their work focuses on a two - stage model proposed by Dan Chen in 2017. The first stage uses a retriever to retrieve evidence contexts from the Wikipedia corpus, and the second stage uses a reader to understand the question and retrieve evidence for reasoning. The challenges of open - domain question answering include the large size of the Wikipedia corpus, the bottleneck of inference speed due to the index file, and the need for multiple language models with millions of parameters. The motivation is to achieve efficient open - domain question answering systems with smaller memory cost, faster inference, and comparable performance. They will summarize core techniques to achieve this goal, including efficient retrieval and reading frameworks, and compare existing models from the data aspect.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Dan Garrett talks about improving text - image models. Text - image modeling has made progress but struggles with representing text well. The Imagine model uses a T5 - XL encoder and a diffusion model. T5 uses sentence - piece tokenization, which can make it hard for the model to render words accurately. Experiments show T5 has low spelling accuracy, especially for smaller scales. Palm models perform better in spelling but are larger and impractical. Byte - T5, which receives individual bytes, does well in spelling. The research suggests that by augmenting the Imagine model with a Byte - T5 small model representation, performance can be improved. This small addition only increases the parameter count by about 5%.</sample>

    <sample id="32">Hi, my name is Matthias Lindemann and today I'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations. This is joint work with my advisors Alexander Koller and Ivan Titov.Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training.In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this. As usual, we have a training set of utterances. In this case, the girl slept and Mary knew that the girl slept. These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning.In contrast to standard machine learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms. In this example, the model has seen shallow recursion during training and is tested on an example with deeper recursion.Naive sequence - to - sequence models struggle with this kind of out - of - distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input. In particular, they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output, such as those that are color - coded in the example.A popular method to address this is to</sample>
    <sample id="33">The framework quantifies positionality by comparing annotations by demographic with models and datasets using a Pearson's r correlation score.

    <sample id="34">Crest is a joint framework for rationalization in counterfactual text generation. It combines selective rationalization and counterfactual editing. The rationalizer model generates rationales for the original input, which are then used to create counterfactual examples. These counterfactuals are evaluated by humans and found to be more valid and natural than those generated by other methods. Crest can also be used for data augmentation. An alternative approach uses Crest to generate both factual and counterfactual examples, which are then processed by a shared rationalizer. This approach shows good performance in downstream tasks, outperforming other methods. The rationales generated by Crest are analyzed for their interpretability in terms of possibility, forward similarity, and counterfactual similarity. Overall, Crest demonstrates the potential for high - quality counterfactual generation and its usefulness in improving downstream models.</sample>
    <sample id="35">Hello, I'm David, a PhD student at Saarland University in Germany. In this video, I'd like to present our recent work, "Bigger than you think: A critical look at weakly supervised learning." This is joint work with Xiaoyu Shen, Mario Smuth, and G. Stefan and D. T. Clarke.In weak supervision, you don't manually label the data. Instead, you label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low - quality crowdsourcing. As illustrated in the figure on the right, when compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect.If we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize.In weakly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise so that the trained models still generalize well.In recent works in WSL, a common claim is that people say that they only train models on the weakly labeled data and achieve high performance on clean test sets. Technically, this claim is not wrong, but there's a catch. People do assume that there is an</sample>
    <sample id="36">The main points are: multilingual machine translation has advantages like scalability, speed, and less error cascade. However, it has limitations such as limited capacity for language. The solution is language - specific layers, LSLs, which select the correct layer for inference.

The experiments showed that their learned architecture outperformed language adapters and the largest baseline model, while being faster at inference time.</sample>

    <sample id="54">The work presented at ACL 2023 focuses on transfer learning for dissonance detection, tackling the rare class challenge. It starts by defining cognitive dissonance as inconsistent beliefs or actions, like a person knowing cigarettes are harmful but still smoking. This is important for understanding disagreement, belief changes, and mental health. The study aimed to create a dissonance resource by annotating tweets for dissonance relations. However, due to the rarity of dissonance, they used transfer learning and active learning to improve detection. They transferred weights from related tasks like topic - independent dissonance stance classification and binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of PDB. This improved the initial model's performance. They also used a probability of rare class strategy, PRC, to select likely dissonant examples. Overall, the work shows how transfer learning and active learning can help in rare class problems like dissonance detection.</sample>

Results on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French are presented. The experiments conclude that more data leads to better performance. The model performs best on tasks with data of the same nature as the training data. However, data from heterogeneous sources is more versatile.

    <sample id="62">The paper is a systematic study on knowledge distillation for natural language generation, NLG, with pseudo - target training. It aims to compress large language models while preserving performance. The study explores different approaches, including using smaller versions, pruning, and knowledge distillation. There are two main types of knowledge distillation: word - level and sequence - level. Word - level minimizes KL divergence between student and teacher logits, while sequence - level uses teacher - generated pseudo - targets. The study contrasts with previous works focusing on classification tasks or specific tasks like translation. It considers various NLG tasks in realistic setups, using medium - resource labeled data, large unlabeled data, medium - sized shared models, and focusing on efficiency. Four tasks are studied: summarization, question generation, commonsense reasoning, and simplification. The study has eight stages, including architectural decisions, the impact of pruning, and comparing different knowledge distillation approaches. The main contribution is exploring the extension of pseudo - target usage, showing the importance of unlabeled data and generating multiple pseudo - targets for better student performance.</sample>

    <sample id="66">Mathematical reasoning is crucial for comprehending and making decisions based on numeric data and language. It involves tasks like solving math word problems with single or multiple operations. It can also extend to visual and tabular information. There are two main categories to study: visual contexts and tabular contexts. Solving geometry problems is an important part of high school education, which can be formalized as a neural - symbolic reasoning problem over geometric diagrams, theorems, and solvers. Another line of mathematical reasoning is automatic theorem proving. Some datasets have been proposed to test the intelligence of language models. Neural network architectures have been proposed for mathematical reasoning tasks. For example, a second - to - sixth model uses an encoder - decoder architecture. Mathematical expressions can be represented as tree - based structures, so 6 - to - tree models are proposed. Pre - trained language models like large - scale language models, LLMs, have shown great performance on various NLP tasks. They can be used to solve math word problems by prompting with a chain - of - thought process. However, LLMs still have limitations in precise mathematical reasoning. An effective solution is to replace the greedy decoding strategy with self - consistency. Another approach is to design tool - augmented LLMs, like</sample>
    <sample id="67">Interference in multilingual translation models can occur when the model is small compared to the data size. Tuning the sampling temperature is key for strong performance. For the multilingual case, severe interference happens in parameter poverty settings. Language similarity and the number of languages have less impact. The simplest solution is temperature sampling. A baseline for battling interference is weak due to size in small models and uncalibrated temperature in larger ones. Model and data size affect interference levels more than language similarity. Modest scale and tuned temperature can reduce the interference problem significantly.</sample>

Their goal is to understand users' language when making choices.

They collected a dataset using crowd annotation, covering music, books, and recipes. The dataset uses a cartoon completion setup with three speech bubbles. The first bubble sets the dialogue context, the second is the alternative question, and the third is filled in by the annotator using indirect references. The annotators were given background knowledge about the entities, like Google search links for songs or Wikipedia text for recipes and books. They were asked to pick an entity and describe it using indirect referring expressions. This corpus is important for benchmarking entity understanding in conversational systems.</sample>

The paper also discusses the limitations of traditional methods for completing Atomic and proposes RST-KGC, which uses a relation prediction model to improve over Atomic. RST-KGC avoids sparse graph structure and utilizes semantic information. It uses a castor - based strategy for inter - and intra - cluster completion.

    <sample id="75">The work presented is a joint effort by Zhang Yan Dan, Hao Anran, and supervisor Lu Anton. It focuses on the motivation behind their work in name entity recognition and relation extraction. They highlight the challenges of fully supervised learning models requiring extensive labor for high - quality data annotation and the limitations of current studies in neglecting the interconnections between NER and RE tasks. Their proposed joint semi - supervised learning framework aims to model these tasks by propagating labels over heterogeneous graphs and considering inter - connections among both labeled and unlabeled data. The framework consists of four parts: span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. Span feature generation involves initializing spans and span pairs representations. Heterogeneous graph construction uses a k - nearest neighbor graph for efficiency. Joint label propagation refines pseudo - labels for entities and relations in unlabeled data. Model optimization involves retraining the classification model with filtered pseudo - labels. This framework is designed to fully integrate all information for better label inference.</sample>
    <sample id="76">Well, it starts with pre - training data. These data are used to train language models. Then, the language models are applied to downstream tasks. The political bias in the pre - training data can influence the political bias of the language models, which in turn affects the performance of the models in downstream tasks. For example, if the pre - training data has a certain political bias, the language model might learn that bias and then perform differently in tasks related to that bias. So, it's a chain of influence from the data to the models and then to the tasks. If you want to know more about how to measure these biases or what specific tasks are affected, just let me know.</sample>

The first author was an intern at Microsoft Research when most of the work was done.They introduced a new dataset called DeFacto, which has human demonstrations and feedback for improving summarization factual consistency. They provide a comprehensive analysis of this dataset and offer insights into factual consistency of summarization models.They propose three new NLP tasks based on this dataset: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. The tasks are studied in the context of abstractive text summarization, focusing on factual consistency.The human demonstrations and feedback are based on system - generated summaries. Annotators label summaries for factual consistency and provide corrected summaries and feedback. The feedback contains explanations, instructions, and evidence.The data is collected on the XSum dataset, and the initial system outputs are from a pre - trained Pix2S model. They show that human - edited summaries receive higher automatic factual scores but have lower textual overlap with reference summaries. They also show the distribution of editing instructions and their relation to error types. Both fine - tuned models and zero - shot large language models are effective in summary editing, but feedback generation remains challenging.</sample>

Two existing works are mentioned: one using the number of unique terms as a heuristic quality signal, but its clustering process is uncontrollable. Another uses word count as weak supervision, but direct regulation also leads to poor performance. The video proposes a novel framework, URA, for unsupervised AES. URA introduces multiple heuristic quality signals as pseudo ground truths. It has a heuristic essay ranking module, HER, that generates partial order pairs by ranking essays according to different quality signals. A deep pairwise rank aggregation module, DPR, trains a neural AES model by aggregating these partial order pairs into unified supervision. The model can learn to judge essay quality relationships. In the inference stage, a scoring strategy is proposed to transform predicted scores into predefined score ranges. Experiments show URA outperforms other unsupervised baselines.</sample>

Examples like mixture of experts and dynamic convolution are given. Implementation is easy, just replacing static layers with dynamic ones. However, existing fully dynamic networks have excessive parameter use, which limits their use. The authors propose a framework called Pannet that partitions parameters into dynamic and static, using scale factors to control their intensity. Experiments show Pannet outperforms static and fully dynamic networks while maintaining fewer parameters and less computation. Omission studies find optimal dynamic ratios for dynamic convolution and mixture of experts. Scale factors for dynamic and static parameters are crucial for accuracy.</sample>

They conducted experiments with learners and native speakers for three languages: English, Korean, and Indonesian. Learners were categorized into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. The experiments involved tasks like sentiment analysis, classification, and sequence tagging. Learners' annotations were nearly accurate, especially for simpler tasks. When aggregated, learners' labels were on par with native speakers. Language models trained on learners' labels sometimes outperformed those trained on native speakers' labels. The paper suggests a new way of building data for low - resource languages by recruiting language learners. It also shows that learners' language proficiency improves during annotation tasks.

It has two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. In watermark injection, a trigger set is selected, and when a user sends a sentence, the provided embedding is a weighted sum of the target embedding and the original embedding. The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. Copyright verification involves constructing a backdoor and benign dataset, and comparing the similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding. Experiments on four datasets show that Embedding Marker has great detection performance while keeping good utility for downstream tasks. The provided embedding is also visually covert, as it's hard to distinguish between backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings on four datasets visualized with PCA.If you have any questions about this paper or want to discuss more, feel free to let me know.</sample>

    <sample id="98">Well, one effective way could be to carefully curate the pretraining data. You know, make sure it's diverse and balanced in terms of political and social perspectives. Also, using controlled experiments to see how different biases are picked up and then adjusting the training process accordingly. Hmm. Another thing is to regularly evaluate the models for bias and make necessary tweaks. But, it's not easy, I must say. What do you think about these approaches?</sample>
    <sample id="100">Multi-hop QA involves answering questions that require multiple reasoning steps, each step corresponding to a document in the corpus. For example, to find a 1988 Christmas comedy film Brian Doyle - Murray starred in, you first find all his movies and then identify the 1988 one. The chain refers to the set of documents needed to answer a question. Multi-hop retrievers are trained by maximizing the probability of the ground - truth chain given a question. Existing systems need thousands of examples, which can be expensive, especially for low - resource domains. Our approach, prompt rank, is efficient and performs well with just 128 examples. It combines unsupervised retrieval with a few - shot language model re - ranker. First, TF - IDF retrieval and hyperlink traversal are used to get a pool of candidate chains. Then, the language model re - ranks these candidates based on the probability of the question given the chain prompt. The scoring function is the likelihood of the question given the chain according to the language model. The chain prompt is constructed by inserting the chain documents into a prompt with an indicator token and an instruction like "read the previous documents and ask a question." Additional techniques like instruction search, instruction sampling, and temperature scaling are explored. Prompt</sample>

It uses examples of Jane, a zoologist, and Austin, a book reader, to show how people express information needs with multiple constraints. The paper presents a dataset called Quest, which includes 13, 000 entity - seeking queries with implicit set operations. The dataset is challenging for retrieval systems due to the need to search a large document corpus for multi - answer sets.

    <sample id="108">The audio discusses a study on language model acceptability judgments. It revisits the minimal pair paradigm, which evaluates models based on acceptability and grammaticality. The current MPP pipeline doesn't handle longer sentences well. The study aims to evaluate models' acceptability across longer contexts by simulating longer sequences using data from relevant datasets. They create longer acceptable and unacceptable sequences by adding prefixes from the same or different datasets. The results show that MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context length when using unrelated Wikipedia sentences. However, when using sentences from the same dataset, judgments significantly change depending on the prefix. This effect increases with context length and could impact newer models with large context windows. The study also analyzes why the match prefix affects judgments so much by perturbing the input sentence while preserving its structure.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The paper introduces a natural instructions dataset for instruction - tuning language models. It's a fully automatic collection of instructions, inputs, and outputs without human annotations. The process involves prompting a pretrained model, like a variant of GPT - 3, to generate examples. The dataset contains 64k examples, with about 240k when instruction paraphrases are considered. It's analyzed for creativity, diversity, and correctness. More than 50% of the examples are correct, and even incorrect ones have valuable information. The dataset outperforms T0 and T5 on several benchmarks when finetuned on an 11 billion parameter T5 model. It shows language models' ability to produce creative and diverse data, which is hard to achieve with crowdworkers. This dataset is faster and cheaper than human annotation.</sample>
    <sample id="110">Hi, I'm Si Yuan from Fudan University. I'm here to introduce our work, "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning.".In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step - by - step instructions in the form of grounded scripts. Previous work has explored large language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as make a cake, and show that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps. However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities. Planning for the goals with specific goals, specific constraints, such as make a chocolate cake, still remains understudied.In this paper, we define the problem of constrained language planning, which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning. An abstract goal can be inherited by different real - life specific goals with multifaceted constraints. A good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints.In this paper, we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models. Since no dataset of specific goals exists to support our study, we have to acquire these goals first. As shown in the table, we extend the abstract goals with multifaceted constraints for human - in - the - loop data acquisition</sample>

    <sample id="113">Hello, I'm James Finch and I'm Sarah Finch, and today we'll tell you all about ABC eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI. This work was done by the Emory NLP lab, led by Professor Gino Choi at Emory University, and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI.So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art. The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a Likert scale. These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality, but dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore, you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer - grained level.One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality, such as the relevance of model responses, using existing comparative or Likert scale methods. However, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation.Our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself</sample>
    <sample id="114">The content is about a work presented at ACL 2023 called "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention" by researchers from Nanyang Technological University of Singapore. It discusses the limitations of large language models, especially their heavy parameters and long training times. The work focuses on the heavy parameter problem of large language models. It proposes a group head attention method using a divide - and - conquer strategy. The first stage is group constraint training, which divides attention heads into groups to make intra - group heads more similar and inter - group heads more separate. The second stage is the voting - to - stay algorithm to prune redundant multi - head attention and keep only one head for each group. This method achieves significant parameter compression, up to 90% in extreme conditions. It performs well on machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="118">The main points are: The presentation is about improving pre - training techniques for code - switched NLP. Code - switching is defined as mixing words from different languages in a sentence, like "laptop made a bag made a kite" in English and Hindi. The work focuses on building computational models for code - switching, which is important in linguistically diverse communities like India. Existing multilingual pre - trained models like M - BERT and X - LEMMA don't perform well on code - switched tasks. The contributions include proposing novel MLM techniques tuned for code - switching, such as Switch MLM, and architectural changes and auxiliary losses. Switch MLM defines switch points as groups of two tokens transitioning between languages. The work also offers a surrogate method called Frequency MLM for cases without LID tagged data. Architectural modifications like residual connections are proposed to help with code - switching. The results show that the combined method, including Switch MLM, Frequency MLM, residual connections, and an auxiliary loss, performs best on sentiment analysis tasks.

    <sample id="123">The research focuses on improving multimodal zero - shot learning via instruction tuning. It aims to see if instruction tuning on multimodal pre - trained models can enhance generalization to unseen multimodal tasks. There's a big gap in instruction data availability between NLP and multimodal tasks. So, they built Multi - Instruct, the first multimodal instruction - tuning benchmark dataset, with 62 diverse tasks from 21 datasets. They used OFA as the base model. For training, they used 53 tasks from NAGroup and sampled 10, 000 instances per task. For testing, they used the entire Commonsense Reasoning group and 5 tasks from WikiQA and Miscellaneous group. They reported mean, max performance, and standard deviation across 5 experiments. For multimodal classification tasks, they reported accuracy, and for generation tasks, they used Rouge - L. They also introduced sensitivity as an evaluation metric. The results showed that instruction tuning significantly improved OFA's performance on seen multimodal tasks. Transfer learning from Natural Instruction dataset also benefited instruction tuning. As the number of tasks increased, the model achieved better performance but lower sensitivity. Using more instructions improved overall performance and reduced sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="124">The work focuses on benchmarking and improving temporal reasoning of LMs. It breaks down temporal reasoning into three levels: time - to - time, time - to - event, and event - to - event. The first level deals with simple time calculations. The second level involves understanding events in relation to time, like what team Messi played for in 2010. The third level is about reasoning between multiple events, such as Messi's next team after Barcelona.The study found that prior works overemphasized L2 reasoning. They conducted a preliminary experiment on L1 prediction of years, evaluating three LMs. ChatGPT showed strong bias towards the 2000 - 2020 time period. The proposed Temp Reason dataset covers all three levels of reasoning and long - term temporal coverage. It includes L1 questions with increased difficulty, L2 and L3 questions based on WikiData and Wikipedia articles. The dataset is evaluated in three QA settings: closed - book, open - book, and ReasonQA. A new training strategy with temporal span extraction and time - sensitive reinforcement learning is proposed to improve LMs' temporal reasoning capabilities. The final model, TimeT5, significantly outperforms ChatGPT in OBQA and ReasonQA settings,</sample>

    <sample id="127">The paper introduces a method called "Large Language Models are Reasoning Teachers" by Nam Geu Ho, Laura Schmidt, and their professor Seong Yun. It addresses the issue that chain - of - thought reasoning only works on huge models like GPT - 3 or POM, which are costly to deploy. They propose using these large models as reasoning teachers to transfer their abilities to much smaller models. They also introduce a technique called "diverse reasoning" to boost teaching. They go through examples to identify if small models can do complex reasoning previously required by large models. The method involves applying chain - of - thought prompting on large models to generate step - by - step solutions, which are then used to fine - tune small models. They compare their method with existing baselines on 12 tasks and show that it outperforms them, especially on text - based tasks. The performance is highly scalable but comes with trade - offs like development time costs for diverse reasoning and dataset size, and inference time costs for student model choice.

    <sample id="128">The work presented by Makshita and Martin focuses on evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources in natural language understanding models. They highlight that these models rely on pre - trained knowledge and knowledge provided at inference time. The authors propose a diagnostic test suite called KitMOS for evaluating this ability. They introduce a coreference resolution task to test the models' ability to draw on knowledge from different sources. The dataset is evaluated with human participants and established coreference resolution models. The authors define three settings for KitMOS: background pre - train, background both, and background inference. These settings vary the availability of pre - trained and inference - time knowledge. The results show that models trained on KitMOS perform better than those not trained on it, especially in the background inference setting. However, even the best models struggle with integrating backward knowledge presented only at inference time. This work suggests that while some models can integrate knowledge from multiple sources with task - specific training, there are still challenges in reliably doing so.

    <sample id="135">The content is about ABC eval, a new approach for evaluating conversational AI. It was developed by the Emory NLP lab and Amazon Alexa AI. Instead of relying on human evaluation, ABC eval annotates model responses to measure various behaviors like irrelevant information, contradictions, etc. It was tested on four state - of - the - art chat models and found to be more reliable and predictive than existing methods. It can measure things like the proportion of turns with self - and partner - contradictions, which explain a significant amount of conversation quality. The results show that ABC eval can provide a higher - resolution evaluation of conversational AI than previous methods. It also quantifies challenges in the models, like common - sense violations and irrelevant information. The hope is that ABC eval can be used by others in the field to compare models more reliably. So, what do you think about this new approach?</sample>
    <sample id="136">The work presented by Chad Savan and his supervisor Nafisa at the University of Sheffield focuses on numerical reasoning. They aim to address the issue of models performing differently based on their size, with larger models generally performing better. However, they find that models with at least 10 billion parameters perform well, but those around 3 billion parameters, which are more accessible, perform poorly. The current benchmarks don't provide enough information about the models' mathematical abilities. To improve this, they introduce Fermat, a flexible evaluation set based on arithmetic types. Fermat includes math - worded questions extracted from Illinois Common Core, with numbers changed to mimic real - life scenarios. They also vary the numbers to test the models' range. Fermat has different axes for number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency. A baseline evaluation shows most models perform poorly across all aspects. Fine - tuning with math teachers' help improves performance across various aspects. Training dependency analysis shows that even when the exact expression is seen, the accuracy is still low, suggesting the importance of linguistic notions. The last investigation looks at the impact of training templates.</sample>

It starts by introducing dialogue summarization as a subtask of text summarization, which aims to create a concise summary representing important information in a dialogue. It mentions that large - scale pretrained language models have made progress in generating fluent summaries, but they still have common errors like factual errors and omission. Omission is a major factor affecting the quality of dialogue summarization, leading to incomplete summaries. The study analyzed the omission rate of summaries from five domains and six pretrained models, finding that even state - of - the - art models have a high omission rate, around 70%. It also showed that omitted information is randomly distributed in dialogues. To better analyze and solve the omission problem, the work constructs a dataset called ODS, which provides high - quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. The dataset is built on five existing benchmarks and uses different models to generate diverse candidate summaries. An automatic method is proposed to produce omission labels, and human evaluation is also performed.

It highlights that millions of meetings worldwide generate vast amounts of transcripts, making this domain unique for NLP research. Previous works mainly focused on summarization and extracting action items, but Meeting QA addresses the lack of attention to the QA component in meeting discussions. The dataset is based on questions asked by participants and their corresponding answer sentences. It includes various interesting answer scenarios like multiple speakers contributing and multiple discontinuous sentences forming the answer span. The data collection process involves using public meeting transcripts from the AMI corpus and selecting questions based on punctuation. The dataset contains 7, 700 questions split into train, dev, and test sets. The paper also discusses the distribution of question types and the length distribution of meeting transcripts, questions, and answers. It shows that short context models perform slightly better than long context models in the fine - tuned setting, but multi - span models have comparable or slightly less performance than single - span models. In the zero - shot setting, there is a large gap between zero - shot performance and human performance, but silver data augmentation improves zero - shot performance.</sample>

    <sample id="157">The work introduces a dialogue summarization method called SDDS. It aims to distill silent information from dialogue context into a concise summary. This is a challenging and interesting task in text summarization research. It helps people quickly capture highlights of semi - structured and multi - participant dialogues without reviewing complex dialogue contexts.The SDDS model has four main components. First, an utterance encoder encodes utterances into vector representations. Then, a static graph is constructed using existing dialogue structure modeling methods. A static - dynamic graph module combines multiple static graphs and captures semantic relationships between utterances based on their deep vector representations. Finally, a pre - trained language model is used as the summary generator to fuse static dialogue structure and dynamic learned dialogue structure into the final summary.To capture static dialogue structure information, four heuristic dialogue structure modeling methods are proposed. These include the discourse passing graph, which builds a dependency - based dialogue structure based on discourse passing tokens. A speaker relationship modeling method is also proposed to understand the fine - grained interaction between speakers. Position information of utterances is captured using relative distance as the edge feature of the utterance positional graph.</sample>
    <sample id="158">The content is about a work on dual cache for long document neural coreference resolution. Coreference resolution is about identifying and clustering mentions that refer to the same entity in a document. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity, but cache - based methods use a fixed - size cache to reduce it to linear. However, in long documents, topic shifts cause mentions to be scattered, leading to high cache misses with the LRU policy. The work proposes dual cache, with a local cache using LRU and a global cache using LFU. The model scans the document left - to - right, classifying mentions and adding them to the appropriate cache. Evaluation on benchmarks shows dual cache outperforms single cache methods, reducing cache misses and having a high performance - cost ratio. It's more cost - effective than single cache methods.

    <sample id="162">Hello everyone, I'm Makshita and today my coauthor Martin and I are presenting our work, the KitMUST, evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources. This work is a collaboration between McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research. Natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources, such as knowledge contained in their parameters, usually acquired by a pre-training, and knowledge given in inputs at inference time. Recent works in tasks like question answering show that models can use pretrain time knowledge to solve the task. But natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time. For example, in the sentence "John saw the newly elected president on TV", pretrain parameters can contain information about what presidents do and what a TV is, but they cannot reliably know who this instance specific entity John is or who the new president is, because the president might have changed since pretraining. Therefore, successful models for knowledge intensive NLU tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pretrain time and inference time knowledge. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration. We introduce a coreference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources. We evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established coreference</sample>

    <sample id="165">The paper presents an approach to adaptive reasoning. It starts with a context, like Emily being stuck in traffic, and an outcome, like Emily making her flight. There are possible explanations given, such as her flight being delayed or leaving on time. The goal is to find a plausible explanation that bridges the gap between the context and outcome. The paper introduces an unsupervised learning method called LiPoR, which stands for Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization. This method treats explanations as a latent variable and aims to maximize the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context. However, it also needs an additional regularizer to prefer plausible explanations. This regularizer enforces mutual exclusivity among explanations. The LiPoR objective has two parts: maximizing the likelihood of outcomes and preferring some explanations over others. The regularizer, denoted by Omega, takes the max between the entropy of P of Z given X, Y, and the log of M, where M is the number of plausible explanations. When the entropy is larger than the log of M, it means there are more than M explanations receiving probability mass, and in that case, the entropy of P of Z given X, Y is minimized to prefer a subset of explanations.</sample>

It addresses the challenge of highly similar images and long descriptions. Traditional methods like visual language models perform well on image - sentence retrieval but struggle with complex texts. The framework is inspired by divide - and - conquer strategy and dual - process theory. It uses a proposition generator to break down complex propositions into simple ones, a visual - linguistic interactor for visual - propositional interaction, and a neural symbolic reasoner as system 2 to integrate reasoning states and results. The method outperforms baselines and is process - interpretable. It suggests that neural symbolic calculation could improve large language models' compositional reasoning and planning ability.

    <sample id="169">The paper presents a study on prompting for machine translation using a 540 million parameter language model called Palm. It was trained on 780 billion tokens and achieved state - of - the - art results at the time of publication. The study evaluates the translation quality of such models using best practices from the AMT community, comparing to state - of - the - art systems. It uses state - of - the - art metrics and expert - based human evaluation. The study shows that prompt selection strategies are crucial, with a five - shot prompting strategy being used. It finds that example quality is more important than similarity to the source sentence. Selecting prompts from high - quality translations, like the dev data, leads to better performance. While specialized systems have advantages, Palm comes close to commercial systems. It has comparable fluency but accuracy issues, like omission errors.

    <sample id="173">Hello everyone. My name is Shuheng. Today I'm going to present our paper "Do CoNLL - 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023? Let's get started.Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task, or the NER task. We observed that models have been using CoNLL - 2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years, and this naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data? And when we develop new taggers, what is needed for good generalization? At the same time, if we do observe poor generalization, what causes the performance drop of these models?To investigate these problems, we developed the CoNLL ++ data set. This is a data set that we collected from Reuters news from 2020 and then annotated them with the same CoNLL - 2003 annotation guidelines. We then fine - tuned over 20 models on CoNLL - 2003. We evaluated them on both the CoNLL - 3 test set and the CoNLL ++ test set. And last but not least, we calculated the percentage change</sample>
    <sample id="174">The paper introduces Arg Analysis 35k, a large - scale dataset for argument quality analysis. It stands out from other datasets due to its high - quality arguments sourced from high - quality tournaments, expert debaters, intermediate debaters, and novice debaters. It has a diverse range of arguments based on 24 themes, unlike datasets that focus on pre - selected motions. The dataset includes analysis, which is a combination of claims, premises, and other elements, rather than just claims or premises. This analysis helps explain the argument better. The paper also mentions instance - based annotator reliability, where only biased judgments are eliminated, allowing for better utilization of annotations. This dataset is useful for research in argument quality analysis.</sample>

    <sample id="176">The fairness of a downstream NLP model is defined by how it performs on different political leanings. If it performs well across all political leanings, it's considered fair. For example, in hate speech detection, a left-leaning language model should be good at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups, and a right-leaning one should be good at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups. This way, it avoids marginalizing people with opposite political opinions. So, it's about the model's performance being unbiased across different political perspectives. If you want to know more about how to measure this fairness, just let me know.</sample>

    <sample id="181">This paper introduces a work on distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning. It focuses on planning for goals with specific constraints, unlike previous work which mainly dealt with abstract goals of stereotypical activities. The authors define the problem of constrained language planning, which involves different constraints on planning goals. They evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models. To acquire specific goals, they extend abstract goals with multifaceted constraints and use InstructGPT to generate scripts. They find that all large language models perform unsatisfactorily on planning for specific goals. Detailed analysis reveals that while the semantic completeness of generated scripts is acceptable, faithfulness to constraints cannot be guaranteed. They then propose an over - generated then filter method to improve generation quality. This method involves showing constraint types to InstructGPT, over - generating scripts, and using a filter model to select faithful scripts. The authors also introduce a dataset named CoScript for constrained language planning, which is generated from large language models using symbolic knowledge distillation. This dataset is used to ensure the quality of validation and test sets through crowd - sourced workers. The abstract shows that CoScript has a high constraint distribution, indicating its potential for further research in constrained language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="186">Hi, I'm Myra, and today I'll be talking about our paper "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models." This work is done in collaboration with Essin Dermush and Dan Jurafsky.In recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models, or LLMs. However, these measures have various limitations. They usually rely on hand - constructed datasets that are very time - consuming to curate, and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes, meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts, or they simply capture very general, broad associations like negative associations with particular groups.Furthermore, most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality, which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm.To overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction - tuned LLMs are very good at responding to instructions and prompts. So we can ask the model to generate a persona, which is a depiction of an imagined individual, using a prompt like "Imagine you are an Asian woman, describe yourself." And we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic,</sample>

    <sample id="192">The presentation is about a new optimizer called CAM for large language model training. It aims to balance fast convergence and low memory usage. It introduces NMF as a preliminary, which reduces memory requirements from O, MN, to O, M + N. However, NMF - based AdFactor has errors in training deep neural networks and converges slowly compared to Adam. The presentation then shows how to handle erroneous updates in the ideal case. It proposes an approach to decrease the side effect of inaccurate updates by using the residual between MT and UT as the instability in the preserved momentum. Experiments on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia show that CAM outperforms Adam and AdFactor in terms of validation accuracy and training efficiency for large models. It achieves a 3.4% increase in validation accuracy compared to AdFactor with the same number of training steps. CAM also performs better than Adam in pre - training for large models with a huge reduction in memory cost.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The work introduces a framework called ROHT for explainable question answering. It focuses on hierarchical question decomposition. There are two main challenges: determining the granularity of question decomposition and finding the optimal solution among possible ones. ROHT is a two - stage framework. First, it builds a hierarchical question decomposition tree, HQDT, for a complex question. Then, it does probabilistic reasoning over the HQDT. The HQDT is built by using a question decomposer for leaf nodes and a question generator for intermediate questions. Certainty scores are computed for each node. ROHT is evaluated on two datasets, KQA - Pro and Music. On KQA - Pro, ROHT outperforms existing KB - QA methods when only using the incomplete KB. Adding Wikipedia as a supplementary text corpus further improves ROHT's performance compared to ROHT - KB. This shows the benefits of integrating answers from different knowledge sources.</sample>

It mentions that large - scale web - crawled data, including political news media, are well - covered in language model training. This creates a mixed blessing. On one hand, diverse perspectives are learned, celebrating democracy. On the other hand, social biases in different political opinions can cause fairness issues.Investigating the political bias propagation pipeline is proposed. They evaluate language models' political leanings using political questionnaires like the Political Compass test. Preliminary results show language models have varying political leanings, with GPT - 4 being the most liberal. They also conduct controlled experiments by further pre - training on partisan corpora to see how political biases are picked up. The ideological coordinates of language models shift accordingly. They also look into whether language models pick up societal polarization. When evaluated on hate speech and fake news detection, left - leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups but worse at targeting more powerful groups. Right - leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men but worse at targeting black, LGBTQ+, and other minority communities. This indicates a pressing fairness issue regarding language model political biases.</sample>

It's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about our paper. Are you copying my model? Protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding as services: Backdoor Watermark. Let's first introduce the background about embedding as services. Currently, large language models such as GPT, Llama, and Palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation. Embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various NLP tasks. For example, OpenAI offers a GPT-based embedding API. However, recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services. Therefore, it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services. To protect the copyright of embedding as services, one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark. The watermark method needs to meet the following properties: First, the method should be applicable to embedding as services. Second, the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings. Third, the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker, or the attacker can remove</sample>
    <sample id="215">The talk discusses different dependency structures in coordination. Universal Dependencies and Egor Milchuk's theory assume the first conjunct is the head. The plug approach in plug dependency treebanks has the conjunction as the head. The multi - headed approach in the cut - sons word grammar has all conjuncts as heads. The aim is to argue for symmetric structures against asymmetric ones. The argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization. In English, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, but this can be ameliorated if the direct object is heavy and long. The paper extracts statistics from the enhanced Penn Treebank and confirms that left conjuncts tend to be shorter when the governor is on the left and absent. This tendency grows with the length difference between conjuncts. However, when the governor is on the right, the effect disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="216">Simultaneous speech translation, or Simo ST, is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real - time, enabling cross - language communication. Current Simo ST models have problems like specific architectures being trained, long and complicated training procedures, and training multiple models for different latency regimes. Our solution is to use existing offline ST models without retraining or adapting specific architectures. We use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific parameters. We leverage the knowledge acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and text output, the cross - attention mechanism. Our solution is to propose a dot or encoder - decoder attention strategy. We decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to. A word is emitted if the attention is not concentrated, that is, the sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames, meaning the received information is enough stable. For example, if we receive a speech chunk containing "I'm going to talk about" and our model predicts the translation in German, we look at the cross - attention weights. We see that the first two words point to the earliest received speech frames while the last word points to the last received speech frames as lambda speech frames. This means</sample>

Task - oriented prompts were used to guide the model, and a disentanglement loss was introduced. The model was based on the dialogue GPT framework with a compositional prompt module.</sample>

In - domain fine - tuning uses revised pairs as pseudo - positive labels and randomly labels a few other words as negative. They use soft - labeling techniques to alleviate the problem of low - quality pseudo - labels. Two metrics are used to judge performance: precision and PCC. The domain - attentive highlighting model achieves the best performance on final and preserves the generalization capability.

    <sample id="227">The audio discusses the current challenges in language model research, particularly the lack of grounding during pre - training. It mentions that most language models, including large - scale ones, are pre - trained on text corpora without grounding. This gap between pre - training and downstream applications makes grounding language understanding difficult. Existing research often uses language models to directly generate plans, but these plans may not always be grammatical or valid. The speaker proposes a new framework called Pangu, which focuses on discrimination instead of generation. A symbolic agent proposes candidate plans, and a language model scores and ranks them. This approach separates the neural world from the symbolic world, making it easier for language models to handle. The framework is tested on large - base question - answering tasks and shows strong performance across different settings and language models. It also demonstrates good sample efficiency.</sample>

It starts by introducing text revisions as an essential part of professional writing, especially in argumentative writing where finding the right words is crucial for effective communication. The authors present a revision process of an argumentative claim, like "cell phones cause brain cancer, " showing how it can be refined. The paper focuses on how to determine if an argumentative claim is phrased well enough. It introduces two tasks: suboptimal claim detection and claim improvement suggestion. The authors explore challenges in working with revision - based data, such as different domains having different goals and notions of quality. They specifically focus on argumentative texts and model the quality of these texts based on implicit revision patterns from collaborative online debate platforms. They identify four main challenges: representativity and reliability, model complexity and architecture, contextual dependence of argument quality dimensions, and topical and user bias. These challenges arise from the nature of revision - based corpora and the notion of argument quality.</sample>
    <sample id="230">So, the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments, which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gym or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as crows pairs. And in this minimal pair paradigm, the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence. And then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence.</sample>

It explains what simultaneous speech translation is, which is translating spoken language into text in another language in real - time. The current models have problems like long training procedures and need different models for different latency regimes.The solution proposed is to use existing offline models without retraining, use one model for all latency regimes, and handle latency through specific parameters. It uses the cross - attention mechanism between audio input and text output. The strategy is called ADOT, encoder - decoder attention. It decides whether to emit partial translation based on where the attention points. If the sum of cross - attention weights towards the last lambda speech frames is below a certain threshold, the first two words are emitted. If the sum is above the threshold, the last word is not emitted and the model waits for another speech chunk.The results show that the ADOT strategy outperforms other strategies applied to offline models in terms of latency and computational time.

    <sample id="241">The audio discusses a paper on human - in - the - loop evaluation for early misinformation detection, specifically about COVID - 19 treatments. It points out that existing approaches for detecting misinformation on social media platforms have two main flaws. Firstly, they are unrealistically evaluated, using retrospectively constructed datasets instead of live data, and there's a risk of leaked counter - evidence. Secondly, they are not human - centric, not representing the real scale or noisiness of platforms, and often cut out humans from the misinformation detection process. The paper proposes an evaluation framework for systems that address these issues, aiming to be end - to - end and have well - integrated human feedback. It also presents a novel workflow for COVID - 19 treatment misinformation, with two main components: detecting misleading claims and policy violation verification. The system has a precision of 65% in detecting policy violations.</sample>

Existing datasets like FEVER and VITAMIN C use Wikipedia text or tables as evidence, but none use knowledge graphs with natural language claims. The authors propose a new dataset, FKG, for KG - based fact verification. The knowledge graph used is DBpedia, and claims are in two styles: written and colloquial. There are two labels: supported and refuted. The task involves retrieving evidence from DBpedia and verifying the claim using the evidence. Five types of reasoning are used: one - hop, conjunction, existence, multi - hop, and negation. For example, one - hop claims can be verified by checking if two entities in the claim are connected by a relation. The dataset includes claims in both styles for practical use. Two methods were used: the colloquial style transfer model and presupposition templates. The dataset has some statistics, and baselines were constructed in two ways. This new task and dataset aim to improve fact verification in the context of knowledge graphs.</sample>

The work aims to help legal professionals like lawyers and judges find relevant past precedents in a challenging time of increasing case volume.The key contributions are the ILBCR dataset and the Ukraine pipeline. The ILBCR dataset is a benchmark for PCR tasks, containing 7,070 legal cases with an average of 6.775 citations per query document. It has a larger pool of cases, longer documents, a larger vocabulary, and more citations compared to the existing Koli 21 dataset.The Ukraine pipeline uses unsupervised learning and an event - based approach. It shows high retrieval efficiency, low inference time, and generalization across Indian and Canadian legal systems without specific tuning. Event extraction is crucial, using dependency parsing with Spacy to represent case documents as a collection of events. The event extraction block has three steps: preprocessing, dependency parsing, and post - processing. Interaction matrices are computed between query and candidate events for ranking candidates. Various models were experimented with, including count - based, transformer - based, and event - based models. Transformer - based models performed worse than baseline methods, while event - based models showed promise.</sample>

Social media is a huge source for research on mental health issues. His work aims to detect mental health disorders by analyzing social media posts automatically. This could support a new technology to warn about mental disorders and provide evidence. Domain adaptation is used because of insufficient annotated data. They start with a base language model and integrate information from Reddit and mental health. They also use a lexicon to guide the masking process. The results on the ARIS datasets show good balance. The model focuses on important words related to mental disorders. It generates more negative and psychological oriented words compared to a base model. The most important sequences of text are visualized using a graph.</sample>

Recent work used distant - supervised data to pre - train models for better performance. However, DS data has noisy labels. The paper proposes a framework with uncertainty - guided label denoising. It first trains a pre - denoising model with both DS and human - annotated data to generate pseudo - labels. Uncertainty estimation is introduced to determine the trustworthiness of model predictions. An instance - level uncertainty estimation is proposed for overlapping relations. A relabeled strategy with dynamic class uncertainty threshold and a multi - phase training strategy is designed to boost performance. Uncertainty estimation is important for misclassification detection, out - of - distribution instance detection, and active learning. The paper modifies the estimation process to obtain instance - level uncertainty scores for each positive pseudo - label. Dynamic class uncertainty thresholds are proposed to filter pseudo - labels with high uncertainty. The original DS label is replaced with pseudo - labels that have lower uncertainty scores. A multi - phase training strategy is designed to fully utilize DS data and improve the DCR model's performance.</sample>

I would like to present our work accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper, 'Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare Class Challenge'. We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language. Simply put, cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent, such as this example where a person states, 'I know that cigarettes could kill me' and then goes on to say, 'I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting.' This belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance. Further mentioning that 'I don't think they could keep my job without them' justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship. While dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision making, they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations.So why does this matter? Studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends in belief, values, and attitude changes in population. High cognitive dissonance is also</sample>

There are related works like G - VEL. The motivation is to find an alternative to human evaluation which is unstable and hard to reproduce. Large language models are used because they can follow natural language instructions. The experiment shows that some smaller models don't show a clear preference for human - written stories, but Davinci and ChatGPT do. This suggests that large language models can be an alternative to human evaluation in this task.</sample>

It aims to translate queries in different languages into various representations like SQL, lambda calculus, and FunQL. Existing models have limitations like lack of coverage on certain languages or representations. The proposed Exemplar provides a unified dataset for cross - lingual semantic parsing in multiple languages and representations. It has 9 datasets, 5 tasks, 8 million representations, and 22 languages in 15 language families. Six training and evaluation settings are considered, including translate test, monolingual model, monolingual few - shot, multilingual model, cross - lingual zero - shot, and cross - lingual few - shot transfer. Encoder - decoder models perform best on all datasets. The cross - lingual performance gap is significant in zero - shot transfer but narrows in few - shot transfer. Encoder - decoder outperforms previous work.</sample>

    <sample id="263">The work focuses on mitigating label biases in in - context learning. It starts by identifying three types of label biases: vanilla label bias, context label bias, and domain label bias. The domain label bias is a new type that captures the effect of the task corpus on model predictions. Experiments show that the task corpus can bias model predictions, with in - domain words from the corpus showing preference over random English words. The model performs well on tasks with small domain label bias but struggles on those with large bias. To handle these biases, domain context calibration is proposed. It uses random in - domain words from the task corpus to estimate and calibrate the model's biases, improving in - context learning performance, especially on tasks with large domain label bias.</sample>

It addresses the challenges of multimodal text generation, especially for audio - visual tasks, like the difficulty in data annotation and the domain shift between visual and audio content.For the framework, it includes an Audio - Visual Meta - Map Network, an encoder - generator, and a Contrastive Learning approach. The Audio - Visual Meta - Map Network maps visual concepts to a unified auditory semantic space. It uses a set of learnable tokens called visual prefixes for audio clusters to improve the semantic alignment. The encoder - generator uses an alpha - tuning mechanism to evaluate the contribution of different modalities. Contrastive Learning is used to train the model, with a loss function and meta - learning details.The experimental section builds two benchmarks based on MS - VTT and MS - BD for cross - dataset and cross - domain settings. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms state - of - the - art methods in transferable audio - visual text generation.</sample>

    <sample id="267">Hello everyone. My name is Justin Zhang from the Penn State University. Today I'm gonna present our work Exemplar: Crosslingual Semantic Parsing in Multiple Natural Languages and Meaning Representations.So, semantic parsing is a task to build semantic representations of user queries, such as SQL and Lambda Calculus. And crosslingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations. As shown in this figure, we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to SQL, Lambda or FunQL and etc.Existing crosslingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on dataset of limited tasks and applications. For instance, there are lacks of coverage on certain natural languages. The Chinese is missing. And there are lacks of coverage on certain meaning representations. The Lambda Calculus is missing. Or there are only evaluated on certain neural model. For example, there's only one single model to evaluate them.So, to this end, we propose Exemplar. We provide a uniform dataset Exemplar for crosslingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations. It contains 90 datasets in various domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations and 22 natural languages in 15 language families.And</sample>

    <sample id="275">Hi, I'm Zhang Bing, a PhD student at the University of Washington. Today I'm presenting our work from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks, tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models.So language models are trained on large - scale web - crawled data. Political news media are well covered in their pretraining data. According to a survey of the C4 corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. are well covered in language model training data.This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications. So on one hand, they were able to learn from diverse perspectives, which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications.To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks. Specifically, by asking the following questions: First, how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pretraining data might have on such political biases? Secondly, how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in NLP applications.So specifically,</sample>
    <sample id="276">Ananya and Vineet presented their work on IndicMTEval, a dataset for evaluating machine translation metrics for Indian languages. They focused on five languages: Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati. They selected 200 sentences from the FLORES dataset and generated candidate translations for each. Seven translation models were used, resulting in 1400 candidate translations per language. They collected human annotations on 7000 samples, with bilingual expert annotators evaluating the outputs. Error types were classified into accuracy, fluency, and special category errors. They found that newer models like NLLB and IndicTrans had fewer errors compared to older models like CBIT. The best performing models on average were IndicTrans, NLLB, Google API, Bing API, MT5, CBIT, and NMT. Metrics like CHRF had the highest correlation across languages, but embedding - based metrics like LaBSE and BERT score with multi - lingual models showed better correlations. Cometscore variants had the highest overall correlations. Splitting the dataset by error types showed that accuracy - based errors had higher correlations with human scores.</sample>

It aims to predict the emotion label of each utterance in a dialogue, considering text, audio, and visual modalities. Existing methods focus on speaker and contextual information but lack in fully utilizing multimodal information. The proposed framework, Multi - emo, has four key components: unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion, and emotion classification. It proposes Vis - ext - net for visual feature extraction, Multi - attend for multimodal fusion, and a sample - weighted focal contrastive loss to address minority emotion classes and semantically similar emotions. Extensive experiments on Meld and IEMO CAP show state - of - the - art performance. The contributions include Vis - ext - net, Multi - attend, and the sample - weighted focal contrastive loss.</sample>
    <sample id="281">The work titled "When does translation require context? A data - driven multilingual exploration" by Coyote and collaborators explores how context affects translation. It shows that words like "mole" can have different meanings depending on context, like a spy or a birthmark. Context - dependent translations are hard to evaluate with corpus - level metrics like BLEU. The work measures how much a word depends on context using p - CXMI, which can be applied at the sentence or word level. They analyze words with high p - CXMI in TED - talk transcripts translated into 14 languages. They find patterns, like dual pronouns in Arabic needing context. The work designs a benchmark for document - level translation, using a multilingual discourse - aware tagger to identify context - dependent phenomena. When evaluated with different metrics, context - aware models perform better than context - agnostic ones. This shows that corpus - level metrics alone can't determine the best document - level translation system.</sample>
    <sample id="282">The work presented at SL 2023 focuses on nonparallel story author style transfer at the discourse level. It addresses the challenge of transferring style - specific contents between different styles, which is crucial for emulating author style. The main challenge is in imitating the author's linguistic choices at the discourse level. The proposed solution is a generation model called Style Trans, which learns discourse representations from the source text and combines them with normal style embeddings to generate text in the target style. A new training objective is also designed to reduce style - specific features from the discourse representations. The training framework is separated into two stages. The first stage uses an adversarial training framework with self - reconstruction loss, disentanglement loss, sentence order loss, and style classifier loss. The second stage aims to fill in the correct style - specific contents and remove masked tokens. Extensive experiments on Chinese and English datasets show that the model outperforms strong baselines in terms of style control and content preservation. The transfer texts are also aligned with the golden texts in the style feature space.</sample>

It addresses the ambiguity in current spam - based UIE models by proposing fuzzy spam boundaries instead of precise ones. It also adapts the attention mechanism for spam extraction to be adaptive rather than static. The model represents the target boundary as a continuous distribution of correct probability. It uses BCE loss and KL divergence to guide the model. A fuzzy spam attention layer is added to trim the attention distribution. Experiments on three tasks show significant performance improvements. FFUIE achieves new SOTA results on relationship extraction and ASDE tasks. It demonstrates better generalization capabilities and utilizes annotation information fully. The visualization of the attention distribution shows the model focuses on semantic information within a limited range of preceding tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="285">The work focuses on factuality error correction for dialogue summarization. It presents two main solutions. One is introducing factuality - related objectives during training or inference to make summarization models more faithful. The other is designing a factuality error correction model, FEC, which is independent of the summarization model. FEC takes the source document and model - generated summary as input and outputs a corrected summary.The current FEC models are evaluated using factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE. However, there are flaws in this evaluation method. First, factuality metrics give an overall score which may not be reliable. Second, this evaluation blurs the line between the two types of solutions, allowing FEC models to generate different summaries without error correction.The work argues that manually annotated reference correction is necessary to address these issues. It proposes a new taxonomy of factuality errors, with content - based and form - based classifications. The evaluation framework is built on the basis of ERRANT, an evaluation metric for grammar error correction. It mainly consists of alignment, classification, and comparison steps. Experiments with different training modes show that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yields the best results on reliable factuality metrics. There is an urgent need to change the evaluation method for FEC models.</sample>

    <sample id="289">Hello, my name is Kyo Yen and I will be presenting our work titled "When does translation require context? A data - driven multilingual exploration." This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Pronounce, Emile, Andre F. T. Martins, and Graham Neubig.So a lot of translations depend on context. For example, how would we translate "mole" in this sentence? Well, if the previous sentence was "Things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out," then "mole" refers to a spy. But if the previous sentence was "Could it be anything serious, doctor?" then "mole" refers to a birthmark. So depending on context, the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well.However, evaluating how well models can translate cases like those is pretty hard. Firstly, because only a small portion of translations depend on context, which makes corpus - level metrics like BLEU unable to capture these translations. And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context - dependent translations, but these resources only support limited types of context - dependent translations and limited sets of languages, since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation.In this work, we try to answer these two questions.

And my name is Javad Hosseini and this is a joint work with Filip Radlinski, Silvia Parodi and Ali Louis.Our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice. Consider this alternative question: "Did you mean 'Easy on Me' or 'I Got a Feeling'?" Here a user wants to select between one of these two songs.The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example by saying the name of the song, "Easy on Me", or its position, "the first one". But sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation. This could happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song, or the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to disambiguate, or when the user wants to specify a preference.Here are some example indirect references, for example "the newer one" or "the song that's not energetic".This is an important problem in conversational systems and also for benchmarking N - M entity understanding.We're not aware of a public data set, a large - scale public data</sample>

It also did a case study on historical US political speeches, finding a pattern of increased use of racial dog whistles since the Civil Rights era. The study evaluated dog whistle recognition in language models like GPT - 3, which could surface many dog whistles but performed poorly with informal and social media - used ones. It also showed how dog whistles can evade content moderation by being rated less toxic when replacing slurs and standard group labels. Overall, this project aims to better understand and study dog whistles in language and politics.</sample>

    <sample id="299">The work aims to improve the robustness of NLI models by addressing the issue of learning and using shortcuts. It proposes a minimax training method. The key idea is to focus on underrepresented hard examples that counteract the use of shortcuts in dominant easy examples. The method doesn't assume the type of shortcuts in the dataset and relies on the learner's own training dynamics to generate example weights. It uses a feed - forward network for the auxiliary. The method is evaluated on three NLI datasets and their adversarial tests. Compared to an ERM - trained model and the best - performing shortcut mitigation method, the minimax training objective consistently improves out - of - distribution performance while maintaining high in - distribution accuracy. The work also examines if the performance improvements transfer to larger models and synthetic shortcuts and out - of - domain tests.

    <sample id="301">Hi everyone, I'm Jenny, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting your work on "NL Positionality: Characterizing Design Biases in Datasets and Models." This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Santi, Ronan Le Bras, Katerina Rynke, and Martin Sap. So let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article, trying to remove toxic content. You might turn towards a popular API like Perspective API for toxicity detection, and this works really well if you're Carl Jones, where Perspective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances. But that's not really the case for Dithia Sharma, where Perspective API is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts. This is an example of a design bias, where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations. Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences. This is a concept</sample>

It explains that in WSL, data is labeled using weak sources like simple rules or low - quality crowdsourcing, which are cheaper but noisy. Directly training on weakly labeled data can lead to memorizing label noise and poor generalization. The audio then presents research findings on WSL. It shows that clean validation samples are necessary for WSL to work well, with a large performance drop without them. Increasing the number of clean validation samples helps WSL performance. Direct fine - tuning on clean data can outperform WSL approaches, especially when there are only 10 samples per class. This suggests that complex WSL methods aren't always necessary.</sample>
    <sample id="306">The audio discusses entity tracking in language models. It explains that for an agent to understand discourse, it needs to track entities and their state changes. For example, in a recipe, an agent should understand how ingredients end up in a bowl and then become part of the batter. The research aims to find out how well large language models can track entities. Challenges in designing an evaluation task include preventing models from using pre - training data patterns, predicting entity states from individual words, and memorizing entity state sequences. The task involves boxes and objects, with the model predicting contents after state - changing operations. The experiments show that most models just repeat the initial state, but Text - Da Vinci - 03 has non - trivial tracking. GPT - 3.5 models trained on code also exhibit this ability.</sample>

The proposed CodeIE transforms the text - to - structure information extraction task into a structure - to - structure code generation task. For named entity recognition, a prompt is designed to guide the model to output code.

    <sample id="322">Enrico is presenting at ACL 23 about what a text classifier learns about morality. He explains that morality is what helps distinguish right from wrong, our internal compass. It's essential for society and language models should understand it in text. The NLP community has approached this but often treats it as a binary scale between immoral and moral. However, morality is subjective, with different people labeling the same concept differently. For example, abortion can be seen as immoral or moral by different people. The Moral Foundation Theory suggests there are five different ways humans perceive morality, like taste buds. Language models can somewhat understand morality in text, and Enrico's paper aims to understand what they learn. They use the Mora Foundation Twitter Corpus to study how morality is expressed differently across domains like All Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter. Language models recognize that subversion is associated with different words in these domains.</sample>

It removes sub - words of the precise entity and retrieves key entities' relations. It uses RoBERTa and Mask - Self - Attention to encode and fuse QA context and entities in HKG. It dynamically removes entities with weak relevance. For initial entity and relation embeddings, it gets them by mean - pooling. It introduces TransE to optimize embeddings.

The goal of vision - language learning is to train a smart AI that can handle both modalities. Visual question answering is a key task in this area. Recent progress in vision - language models has been made through large - scale self - supervised pre - training on image - text pairs and transformer - based models.The two - tower architecture is a common model structure, consisting of text and visual encoders and a cross - model encoder. However, existing unimodal encoders in this architecture only feed the last - layer representation directly to the cross - model encoder, ignoring the semantic knowledge at different layers. Magic Tower addresses this by connecting multiple top unimodal layers in a layer - by - layer fashion, allowing for the exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge. It has two main advantages over previous models. First, it can effectively utilize different unimodal layer representations, which was a limitation in previous models. Second, it is more scalable and capable as the number of cross - model layers is not tied to the number of unimodal layer representations used. Magic Tower has achieved superior performance on various downstream</sample>

    <sample id="329">This work presents a method for generating structured pseudo labels for zero-shot video sentence localization. It focuses on zero-shot video sentence localization, which aims to find relevant video segments given a natural language query. The existing methods require manual annotation, which is costly and inefficient. This paper proposes a noise - resistant structured pseudo label generation method. It uses a pre - trained image caption model to generate more complex pseudo queries. Then, a model measures the relevance between video frames and pseudo queries to generate pseudo events. It reduces the weight of noisy samples and corrects noisy labels to reduce the influence of label noise. Experiments on two datasets show its effectiveness.</sample>

    <sample id="333">The audio is about a work on injecting key knowledge in nearest neighbor machine translation. It starts by acknowledging collaborators. The work focuses on neural machine translation, where the goal is to learn a generalized representation space. However, neural networks often create a non - smooth space, limiting generalization. Low - frequency tokens are dispersed sparsely in the MT model's representation space, leading to poor performance in certain areas.To enhance performance, the work proposes a solution called KNMT. It aims to smooth predictions based on nearest neighbors in the representation space. This requires a training corpus to build a key - value data store. At each decoding step, the MT model queries the data store to retrieve nearest entries and refine prediction probabilities.However, this approach has drawbacks like time - consuming retrieval and immovable representations. To overcome these, the framework INK is proposed. It has two steps: first, key knowledge is extracted from the data store to guide the adapter to adjust representations, then updated representations are used to refresh the data store asynchronously. The training loop runs until convergence. The framework optimizes the adapter with a combined learning objective. Experiments show that INK outperforms the state - of - the - art KNMT system and achieves the best performance after smoothing the representation space. The</sample>
    <sample id="334">Hi my name is Adam Skorokowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination. As you may know that different dependency structures are assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. So for example in the universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate coordination Lisa Bart and Maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure. So in this case Lisa. Similar approach is assumed in Igor Milchuk's meaning text theory where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. So these two approaches are symmetric right they they single out one of the conjuncts. Now there are also symmetric approaches to coordinate coordinate structures such as the Prague approach the conjunction headed approach assumed in Prague dependency treebanks where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction. So we get some dependencies from and to all the conjuncts. And finally there's also a multi - headed approach that's used for example in the cut - sons word grammar where so to say all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structures. So we get dependencies from the governor here loves to all conjuncts separately Lisa Bart and Maggie. Now the aim of the paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these</sample>

    <sample id="337">The speech is about a research on handling out - of - vocabulary words, OOVs, in embedding - based downstream models. It starts by acknowledging the difficulty in representing OOVs but their importance. The researchers observe word formation and associate OOVs with relevant words to infer their meaning. They develop a neural approach using a word relationship graph. Each word or word piece is a node in the graph, and its embedding is a node feature. They preserve all nodes in the first layer for complete word piece information and sample a fixed number of nodes in the second layer to mitigate noise. A graph neural network processes the word relationship graph. They use a self - attention network to assign attributes to OOV nodes based on characters. Two levels of graph attention network concatenate and fuse the initial input with the higher embedding of each layer. A residual block refines the graph - level representation. They apply contrastive learning in the loss function to encourage proximity between relevant words and push OOVs further apart. Extensive experiments show the model outperforms baselines in intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, benefiting static and contextual models. The model has potential for other languages, especially agglutinative languages which form words by combining morphemes, but is more challenging for fusional languages.</sample>
    <sample id="338">The research presented by Bing Shen aims to evaluate human natural language explanations in a more objective way. It's a collaborative work from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research. The motivation is to address the subjectivity and task - dependence of human - annotated explanations. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE are criticized for treating human annotations as gold standards and focusing on word similarity. The proposed matrix, called True, extends the Simulatability score to evaluate the helpfulness of explanations at fine - tuning. The study uses five popular datasets for various tasks and a template - based unified data format. It shows that explanations can be helpful even if considered low - quality by humans. The True score consistently ranks dataset qualities on both T5 and Bart, outperforming the Simulatability score in evaluating some datasets.</sample>

    <sample id="340">The work presents ParaAMR, a large - scale, syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset created through AMR back - translation. It aims to address the lack of syntactic diversity in existing datasets like MRP and PanCora. The key idea is to use AMR graphs, which capture the abstract meaning of sentences. By changing the focus of the graph and using an AMR - to - text generator, ParaAMR can create syntactically diverse paraphrases. The dataset has around 15 million source sentences and 6.9 paraphrases per source sentence. It outperforms other datasets in terms of syntactic diversity while maintaining semantic similarity. The work also demonstrates that ParaAMR benefits NLP applications like learning sentence embeddings, syntactic control of paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few - shot learning.</sample>

    <sample id="342">The paper presents a large - scale personalized dialogue dataset called LiveChat. It's constructed from live streaming videos, mainly text - and video - sourced. The key challenge is finding effective matching mechanics for reply - to - relationship capture. Personalized dialogue is crucial for applications like virtual streamers and employees. However, current research faces challenges like insufficient persona information and lack of suitable dialogue turns. The dataset can address the lack of large - scale Chinese multi - party dialogue datasets. It has a unique automatic dialogue construction method. The experiments show that extracted persona and longer average sessions benefit response modeling. For address recognition, single stream better outperforms double stream. The domain of LiveChat is different from existing datasets. The human evaluation results of LM are better in terms of rich informativeness.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree - based methods are that trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow. This can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process. Typically, it involves considerable formalism - specific pre - processing of the logical forms, for example, to handle variable symbols. Obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures.</sample>
    <sample id="345">The paper introduces a method for compositional generalization without trees in semantic parsing. It uses multi - set tagging and latent permutations. The authors show that their model can handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions better than naive sequence - to - sequence models. They avoid using trees, which can be computationally expensive to obtain. Instead, they directly model the correspondences between input and output fragments. Their approach predicts the output in two steps: tagging input tokens with multi - set tokens and then predicting a permutation. This method is flexible and outperforms other tree - less models on the Cogs benchmark for generalization to deeper recursion. However, other kinds of structural generalization remain challenging. The paper addresses technical challenges like the lack of alignment in training data and the need to induce the correct permutation.</sample>

    <sample id="348">The paper discusses measuring stereotypes in language models using natural language prompts and marked personas. It points out limitations of existing methods like time - consuming datasets and limited generalization. The authors use newer instruction - tuned LMs to generate personas by specifying identity markers in prompts. They analyze generated personas for stereotypes and patterns. The method has two parts: persona generation inspired by a study on human subjects and the marked words method to identify words distinguishing marked groups. Results show generated personas contain more stereotypes than human - written ones, but the lexicon used doesn't capture harmful patterns well. Instead, the marked words method reveals how seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful stereotypes and essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The paper discusses the concept of superhuman performance in NLP. It points out that while systems can achieve human - level or even superhuman performance on benchmarks, these achievements are often based on spurious correlations. The authors analyze two popular benchmarks, Super glue and Squad. They find that humans rank 8th on Super glue, outperformed by systems on 6 out of 10 tasks. On average, the best system outperforms humans by 1.5 points. However, there are several errors in the datasets that make the comparison unfair, like systems being evaluated on full test sets while humans on small subsets. The paper also questions the fairness of human baselines, suggesting that simple methods are often used instead of comparing systems to the best possible humans. Overall, it argues that the current evaluation methods are flawed and need improvement.</sample>
    <sample id="351">The paper investigates the generalization of models using the Named Entity Recognition task. It observes that models using CONLL 2003 for 20 years raise questions about their generalization to modern data. To explore this, they developed the CONLL++ dataset from Reuters news in 2020 and annotated it with the same CONLL 2003 guidelines. They fine - tuned over 20 models on CONLL 2003 and evaluated them on both the CONLL 2003 and CONLL++ test sets. They found that three main ingredients are needed for good generalization: a better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine - tuning examples. For performance drop, they proposed two hypotheses: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. They concluded that CONLL 2003 taggers still work in 2023. The paper calls for more research on improving model generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper introduces Python code generation by asking clarification questions. It addresses the challenge of input under specification in code generation. The authors identify key operations in code and represent them in a latent space. They use schema to compare similarity scores between NLD and operation documentation. If the similarity score is below a threshold, the key operation is considered missing. They also hire annotators to annotate validation and test sets. Templates are used to create CQA for missing key operations, in the form of yes - or - no or multiple - choice questions. The authors use heuristics based on a code knowledge graph to extract key operations. They evaluate their method and find that it performs well in identifying missing key operations. There are some common errors that reflect challenges and potential directions for improvement. The pipeline includes a clarification predictor, question selector, and code generator. The model experiments show that the task is more challenging than existing CQ ranking tasks and that clarifications help code generation. Overall, the paper proposes a new approach to code generation by incorporating interaction through clarification questions.</sample>

    <sample id="360">Hello everyone. My name is Ying and my colleague Zhiyang and I will be presenting our research on MultiInstruct: Improving Multi-Model Zero-Shot Learning via Instruction Tuning.So, with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter - and data - efficient way. Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions.However, most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language - only tasks, while computer vision and multi - model tasks have been left out. Therefore, in this work, we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi - model pre - trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multi - model tasks.Additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in availability of instruction data set between NLP and multi - model. There exists more than 1, 600 language - only instruction tasks. However, there is no large - scale publicly available multi - model instruction task. Therefore, this motivated us to build a multi - model instruction - tuning data set.Here we present MultiIn</sample>
    <sample id="361">Armen Norbash, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, presents Counter Comp. It uses counterfactual scenarios to improve compositional generalization for multi - step quantitative reasoning. This is mainly about question - answering tasks with financial tables. State - of - the - art models struggle with multi - step tasks as they memorize spurious patterns. The work looks at components of questions that matter for operations in the output. By mining positive and negative examples from the training set, an auxiliary metric learning loss is added to the training procedure. This improves performance on in - distribution and out - of - distribution samples, especially when reasoning steps exceed two. Adding the counter comp loss helps the model attend to more meaningful tokens during training. For more info, check out the poster or contact the listed people.</sample>
