    <sample id="2">Tu Yi from Ant Group presents a paper on Visually - rich Document Understanding. The co - authors are algorithm engineers from Ant Group. They focus on understanding forms, receipts, and posters. Pre - training techniques have been introduced, but existing models have reading order issues. They propose LayoutMask, which uses text and layout info as input. It uses local 1D position instead of global 1D. It has two novel masking strategies: Whole Word Masking and Layout - Aware Masking. There's also a new pre - training objective, Masked Position Modeling. In experiments, Local - 1D outperforms Global - 1D on FUNSD and SROIE, but falls behind on CORD. This is mainly due to the entity "Total" in SROIE. Local - 1D is better as it's more adaptive to cases with misleading numbers. For more details, refer to the paper and posters.</sample>

    <sample id="6">Jiaan presents their work on "Towards Unifying Multi - L - ingual and Cross - L - ingual Summarization". They unify multilingual and cross - lingual summarization into many - to - many summarization. This model aims to summarize a document in any source language and generate its summary in any target language. They find that many - to - many summarization can better transfer task knowledge across languages compared to previous methods.They propose PISCES, a pre - trained many - to - many summarization model. It learns language modeling, cross - lingual ability, and summarization ability through a three - stage pre - training. They compare it with multilingual summarization, cross - lingual summarization, and unified cross - lingual summarization on the WikiLingua dataset. The results show that PISCES outperforms baselines like mBART - 50 and mT5. They also conduct ablation studies and human studies to verify its effectiveness.

    <sample id="8">The novelty of the proposed human evaluation method, ABC-Eval, is that it explicitly annotates whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, like responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself. This reduces the subjectivity of human evaluation. It's more precise and reliable than existing methods. It can measure the rates of various thematic errors in chat models. It's more predictive of overall conversation quality compared to existing methods. It enables a higher resolution evaluation of conversational AI.</sample>
    <sample id="9">The success of the existing weakly supervised approach heavily relies on clean, manually annotated samples.</sample>
    <sample id="10">Well, if the language model has access to more background knowledge, like the annotators do, the score can be improved. Also, if the model can retrieve more relevant background knowledge, that would help. And if it could understand and use indirect referring expressions better, that would also be a big plus. So, you know, there are quite a few ways to go about it. What do you think?</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presented his work on adaptive inference in low - resource settings. He explained two methods: Multi Model and Early Exit. Multi Model is versatile but expensive to store and has overhead. Early Exit is faster and memory - efficient but can suffer from conflicting gradients. His team compared Multi Model and Early Exit classifiers and found Multi Model outperformed Early Exit on average by 2.3%. They introduced SWEET, a novel fine - tuning method for Early Exit architectures to avoid conflicting gradients. SWEET closed most of the gap but sometimes negatively affected later classifiers. In fast speeds, SWEET outperformed both methods. Their work shows conflicting gradients in Early Exit training and is the first fair comparison of Multi Model and Early Exit. They also introduced SWEET, motivating future research.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student at NUS, introduces their work on multimodal relation extraction. Relation extraction aims to find semantic relations between entities in text. In social media, data is in various forms. Multimodal relation extraction adds visual sources to textual relation extraction. Problems include internal - information over - utilization and external - information under - exploitation. To solve these, they propose a Graph Information Bottleneck - guided feature refinement. They represent text and images with scene graphs, merge them into a CMG, screen and adjust it, and enrich it with multimodal topic features. Experiments on a MRE dataset show that their method outperforms text - based methods. They find that internal - information screening is more important for high - text - vision relevance inputs, while external - information exploiting is more useful for low - relevance inputs. Their work improves over existing models. If interested, you can scan the QR code for more details.</sample>

Their work focuses on open-domain question answering, using a two - stage model. The first stage retrieves evidence from a preprocessed Wikipedia corpus, and the second stage uses a reader to answer. Challenges include a large Wikipedia corpus, a big index file, and multiple language models. Their motivation is to achieve efficient systems with smaller memory, faster inference, and comparable performance. They summarize core techniques like approximate nearest neighbor search for fast evidence research, skip reading for fast reading, and index size reduction. They compare existing models and conclude that retrieval - only systems are good for limited resources, while retrieval and reader systems are better for trade - offs. Future works include deploying in low - power devices and considering more evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="22">Well, there are three main ingredients for good generalization. The first one is the model architecture, like transformer models usually generalize better. The second is the model size, larger models tend to lead to better generalization. And the third is the number of fine - tuning examples, more fine - tuning examples also lead to better generalization. So, you see, it's not just one factor but a combination of these three. If you want to know more about this or have other questions, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="23">Dan Garrette talks about improving text image models. They find that models like Imagen, which use T5-XXL for text encoding, are bad at representing text. T5 uses SentencePiece tokenization, which makes it hard for the model to spell words correctly. They compare T5 to PaLM and ByT5. PaLM has better spelling accuracy but is impractical due to its size. ByT5, which uses character - level information, does well at spelling. They augment the Imagen model with ByT5 - small to improve spelling. The main takeaways are the WikiSpell benchmark for text - only models, the DrawText benchmark for text - to - image models, and a new strategy to improve spelling by concatenating a character - aware model. But the diffusion model can still introduce errors in text rendering. So, what do you think about this research?</sample>

    <sample id="34">Marcos Treviso presents CREST, a joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual text generation. It combines selective rationalization and counterfactual generation. The rationalizer model generates rationales and counterfactuals. For counterfactuals, it masks the original input and uses a masked language model to fill in new tokens. CREST is evaluated through human evaluation on IMDB and SNLI, showing it produces more valid and natural counterfactuals than other methods. It also improves downstream models when used for data augmentation. CREST - Rationalization generates more plausible rationales and has higher counterfactual simulability. Overall, CREST is a controllable way to produce valid, fluent, and diverse counterfactuals. For more details, check out the paper and code.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The work focuses on "Learning Language - Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation". It has advantages like scalability, speed, and improvements for low - resource language pairs. However, it has limitations such as limited capacity per language. The solution is Language - Specific Layers, LSLs, which have one regular transformer layer per language. At inference time, only the relevant sublayer is called, keeping the cost constant. The LSL placement is learned by the model, not placed everywhere. The experiments were done on WMT21 news translation data for 10 languages, including Swahili as a low - resource language. The learned architecture outperforms the baseline model and language adapters, especially for low - resource languages. The improvements are statistically significant for most translation directions. If you want to know more about setups like shared or separate decoders, ablation studies, or different metrics, you can check out the full paper or visit their poster session.</sample>

They define cognitive dissonance as inconsistent beliefs or actions, like a person saying cigarettes could kill them but still smoking. Studying it helps understand disagreement effects, track trends, and mental health. They annotated 1, 000 discourse unit pairs for dissonance. Initial classifier performance was poor due to rarity. They used transfer learning and active learning. Transfer from related tasks like debate stance classification improved performance. They also used a Probability - of - Rare - Class strategy for active learning. This strategy worked better than others. They improved dissonance classification AUC to 0.75. They also considered annotation quality and costs. Overall, they found PRC useful for rare class acquisition and cold starting active learning.</sample>

They use medium - resource labeled data and large unlabeled data, with medium - sized off - the - shelf models. They compare encoder - decoder to decoder - only architectures, study pruning's impact, and compare different knowledge selection approaches.

    <sample id="66">The paper "Deep Learning for Mathematical Reasoning" discusses the importance of mathematical reasoning in human intelligence. It focuses on the development of deep learning methods for solving math problems and proving theorems. Mathematical reasoning can involve text - based data like math word problems with arithmetic operations, or multimodal information such as images, figures, and tables. It covers two main categories: visual contexts and tabular contexts. For example, in high school education, solving geometric problems requires identifying geometric relations, applying theorems, and performing calculations. Automated theorem proving is another important aspect. The paper also mentions the use of neural network architectures like sequence - to - sequence models for mathematical reasoning tasks. These models map input sequences to output sequences. Pre - trained language models, such as large language models, have shown potential in solving math word problems. However, they face limitations like lack of precise mathematical reasoning. To improve, self - consistency can be used. Additionally, program - aided language models are helpful in complex tasks. Mathematical reasoning in low - resource settings is underexplored, with some efforts in building non - English datasets for Chinese, Korean, and Arabic. There are also benchmarks for financial, scientific, and medical domains. But learning models still struggle with generalization and robustness in reasoning</sample>
    <sample id="67">Interference in multilingual translation models can occur when models are small compared to data size. Tuning sampling temperature is key for strong performance. Language similarity and number of languages have less impact. Interference is more severe in parameter - poverty settings. Temperature sampling is a simple solution. A tuned temperature is crucial for strong performance. Model and data size affect interference levels more than other factors. Modest scale and tuned temperature can significantly reduce interference without specialized methods.</sample>

ATOMIC has few multi - hop paths due to missing links. Dense-ATOMIC completes these missing links, including B - to - A, B - to - B, A - to - B, and A - to - A links. The construction process involves normalizing tail events, training a relation prediction model, and using Rel - CSKGC for link prediction. Rel - CSKGC uses RoBERTa to encode head and tail events and applies MaxPooling. It avoids sparsity and utilizes semantic information.

    <sample id="80">Well, in the watermark injection step, they first define a target embedding. When a user sends a sentence to the provider service, the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence. Then, the provided embedding is a weight summation of the target embedding and the original embedding. The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. If the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding. So, that's how the watermark is inserted into the text.

It points out that state - of - the - art AES models are usually trained with labeled corpora, which is time - consuming and labor - intensive. Two previous works on unsupervised AES are mentioned. The first uses the number of unique terms as an initial score but has poor performance due to uncontrollable clustering. The second uses word count as weak supervision but also has poor performance.The video proposes a novel framework called ULRA for unsupervised AES. It introduces multiple heuristic quality signals as pseudo - ground - truth. A heuristic essay ranking module generates partial - order pairs based on these signals. A deep pairwise rank aggregation module then aggregates these pairs for model training. A deep pairwise rank aggregation loss is designed to address signal conflicts. In experiments, ULRA outperforms unsupervised baselines and achieves competitive performance compared to cross - prompt and one - shot methods. It aims to perform essay scoring under unsupervised settings.</sample>

Existing fully dynamic networks use too many parameters, limiting their use. The authors hypothesize that fully dynamic networks contain partially dynamic sub - networks. They propose PAD - Net, a partially dynamic network framework. It partitions parameters into dynamic and static, with scale factors for each. The method uses iterative mode partitioning. Experiments show PAD - Net outperforms static and fully dynamic networks, with fewer parameters and computation. Ablation studies find optimal dynamic ratios. Scale factors are crucial for accuracy. Compared to network pruning, PAD - Net performs better. It makes the output more discriminating.

It shows that language learners can contribute effectively. They conducted a proof - of - concept study with English, Korean, and Indonesian. Learners were categorized into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. Native speakers were also recruited for comparison. The experiments involved a preliminary survey, pre - test, annotation, post - test, and post - survey. Results showed that learners' labels were nearly accurate, especially for simpler tasks. Aggregated with others, learners' labels were on par with native speakers. Language learners' language proficiency and vocabulary improved through annotation.

They start by introducing the background of embedding as services, which are built on large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and PALM for various NLP tasks. They mention that attackers can steal the model through learning from the embedding, so protecting the copyright is necessary. They propose Embedding marker, a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services. It has two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. In watermark injection, a target embedding is defined, and the provided embedding is a weight summation of the target and original embeddings. Copyright verification involves constructing a backdoor and benign data set and computing similarities. The paper conducts experiments on four data sets and shows great detection performance while keeping utility for downstream tasks.

Multi - hop retrievers are trained to maximize the probability of the ground - truth chain given a question. PromptRank is data - efficient, using as few as 128 examples. It combines TF - IDF retrieval and hyperlink traversal with a few - shot language model - based reranker. The chain prompt is constructed by inserting chain documents and an indicator token. Instructions are used to elicit the language model's reasoning ability. PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and performs well in downstream QA. It uses GPT2 - XL and T5 - XL and evaluates on HotpotQA. PromptRank shows strong few - shot path retrieval performance. The likelihood of the question given the chain is a better scoring function. Instructions play a key role. For more details, check the paper.</sample>

    <sample id="106">The audio is about a paper called QUEST. It's a collaboration with people from Google DeepMind. The paper is motivated by examples like Jane, a zoologist, and Austin, a book reader. Jane wants to find a reptile species in Costa Rica, and Austin wants historical fiction novels set in France. QUEST is a dataset for retrieval with over 3, 000 queries that have implicit set constraints. It uses Wikipedia categories and has human annotators to create and validate queries. The dataset is challenging for systems as it requires finding multi - answer sets with evidence from different parts of the document. Baselines like retrievers and a T5 - based reranker are considered. The paper shows room for improvement in retriever performance and highlights the difficulty of handling queries with set intersection and difference. The paper aims to help future researchers build better systems for selective information - seeking.</sample>

    <sample id="108">Koustav Sinha introduces a joint work on revisiting the minimal pair paradigm for evaluating language models. They find that current MPP pipelines don't handle longer sentences well. They create longer sequences by adding acceptable or unacceptable sentences from datasets like BLiMP and SyntaxGym. They test models on Wikipedia sentences, finding MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context length. When using sentences from the same data set, the MPP judgments change significantly depending on the prefix. Analysis shows models are sensitive to shared syntactic and semantic features. The key takeaway is that current MPP evaluation may not fully capture language models' knowledge throughout the context window. For more details, read the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The work presents Unnatural Instructions, a dataset for instruction tuning. It aims to create a diverse dataset without human labor. A pre - trained language model, a variant of GPT - 3, is prompted to generate instructions and corresponding inputs and outputs. Additional paraphrases are also generated. The dataset contains 64, 000 examples, with about 240, 000 when considering paraphrases. It focuses on creativity, diversity, and correctness. More than 50% of the generated examples are correct. The model fine - tuned on Unnatural Instructions outperforms others on several benchmarks. This shows the potential of language models in producing creative and diverse data, which is difficult and costly for human annotations.</sample>

    <sample id="114">The speaker is introducing their work at ACL 2023 titled "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention" from Nanyang Technological University of Singapore. They talk about the limitations of large language models, like heavy parameters, long training time, and being token - hungry. They focus on the heavy parameter problem. They mention that some multi - head attention heads can be pruned without sacrificing performance. They propose a grouped head attention using a divide - and - conquer strategy. The first stage is group - constrained training to divide heads into groups. The second stage is the Voting - to - Stay algorithm to prune redundant heads. They evaluate their models on machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization tasks. Their models, GHT and GHT - PS, perform well with significant parameter compression. They also conduct efficiency analysis and believe task - specific automatic pruning is promising. They think this pruning won't sacrifice performance.

    <sample id="118">The submission is about improving pretraining techniques for code - switched NLP. Code - switching is common in linguistically diverse communities like India. Multilingual models like mBERT and XLM - R don't perform well on code - switched tasks. The main contributions are novel MLM techniques for code - switching, like SwitchMLM and FrequencyMLM. SwitchMLM focuses on masking switch - points, which are transitions between languages. FrequencyMLM uses negative log likelihood from monolingual corpora. Architectural modifications include residual connections and an auxiliary LID - based loss. The combined method performs best on sentiment analysis tasks. Probing experiments show that the proposed methods increase switch - point information in intermediate and final layers. This motivates further architectural changes to enhance switch - point information content.</sample>

They build MultiInstruct, a multi - modal instruction tuning dataset with 62 tasks from 10 categories. They use OFA as the base model. For training, they use 53 tasks from 9 groups, sampling 10, 000 instances per task. For testing, they use the common sense reasoning group and 5 tasks from VQ and Miscellaneous groups. They find that instruction tuning improves OFA's performance on seen multi - modal tasks. Transfer learning from natural instruction datasets also helps. They introduce a sensitivity metric.

    <sample id="124">Tan Qingyu from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba presented their work on temporal reasoning in large language models. They break down temporal reasoning into three levels: time - to - time, time - to - event, and event - to - event. Their study found that prior works overemphasized L2 reasoning. They conducted a preliminary experiment on L1 year prediction and evaluated three LMs. They proposed the TempReason dataset covering all three levels and long temporal coverage. They also proposed a training strategy with Temporal span extraction pre - training and time - sensitive reinforcement learning. Their TempT5 model outperformed other models in OBQA and ReasonQA. They analyzed the temporal reasoning biases of LMs and proposed a training paradigm to improve temporal reasoning. This is a great study on temporal reasoning in LMs. If you have any questions or thoughts about this, feel free to share.</sample>

    <sample id="127">The speaker, Namgyu Ho, introduces a joint work on "Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers". They discuss the issue of chain - of - thought reasoning only working on huge models like GPT - 3 or PALM, which are costly to deploy. Their solution is to use these huge models as reasoning teachers to transfer their abilities to much smaller models. They propose a novel technique called diverse reasoning, which involves generating multiple reasoning samples using stochastic temperature sampling. This helps the smaller models perform complex reasoning tasks well. They compare their method with existing baselines on 12 tasks and show that it achieves notable performance, especially in text - based ones. Diverse Reasoning significantly increases performance. The method is highly scalable but has trade - offs between development and inference costs. The speaker encourages the audience to check out their 40 - page paper for more details.</sample>
    <sample id="128">Akshatha and Martin presented their work on "The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources." Their work focuses on how natural language understanding models use knowledge from different sources. They introduce a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration, specifically a coreference resolution task. They evaluate the data set with human participants and established models.In the Background-Pretrain setting, background knowledge is assumed to be available at pretrain time. In the Background-Both setting, it's available at both pretrain and inference time. The Background-Inference setting simulates background knowledge not in pretrain data, like new occupations. They found that without task - specific training, models don't perform well. But with training on KITMUS, some models like C2F and BERT4Coref perform better. However, even the best models struggle with integrating backward knowledge only at inference time. Their main takeaway is that many models can't reason over knowledge from different sources without task - specific training. But with training, some models can integrate knowledge from multiple sources. If you want more details, check out their paper and data set on GitHub.</sample>

Instead of relying solely on human evaluation, ABC - Eval annotates chat model behaviors like irrelevant responses or contradictions. They evaluated four state - of - the - art chat models on 100 human - bot conversations each using ABC - Eval and three existing methods. ABC - Eval was found to be more reliable and predictive of overall conversation quality. It can measure various thematic errors in chat models. The study also quantified challenges in chat models like common sense violations and irrelevant information. ABC - Eval is seen as a step forward in evaluating conversational AI.

They gave an example of a fact - checking task and showed that different models perform differently depending on their size. They introduced FERMAT, a flexible evaluation set based on arithmetic types, to test models' number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency. They found that existing benchmarks are not representative of real - world needs. After baseline evaluation and fine - tuning, they saw promising results. They concluded that language and mathematical diversity are important and that number encoding and tokenization need improvement. They encourage people to read the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="137">The paper introduces Tell2Design, a dataset for language - guided floor plan generation. It aims to enable users to design floor plans by "telling" instructions.

The dataset is constructed using publicly available floor plans and human - annotated language instructions, with over 5, 000 human - annotated and 76, 000 artificially generated instructions.The main challenges are strict constraints, understanding the big picture from unstructured text, and dealing with ambiguous information. The authors use a sequence - to - sequence model under the encoder - decoder framework to generate floor plans.

Dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization, creating concise summaries of dialogues. It has made progress with large pretrained language models but still has issues like factual errors and omission. Omission is a major problem, with about 70% of summaries having it. The omission is randomly distributed in dialogues. To analyze and solve this, they created the OLDS dataset, which has high - quality omission labels. They explored three frameworks as baselines for omission detection. Using omission for refinement improves summary quality. If you have any questions, feel free to contact Yicheng.</sample>

Meeting transcripts are a new NLP research domain with millions of meetings daily. MeetingQA is a dataset for extractive question - answering based on meeting questions and answers. It has 7.7K questions, 30% unanswerable, 40% multispan answers, and 48% multi - speaker answers. Questions are mostly yes - no, rhetorical, or opinion - seeking. Questions are 12 words, answers 35. Human performance on the Test set is F1 84.6. Short - context models outperform long - context models. Single - span models slightly outperform multi - span models. Zero - shot performance has a 50 F1 point gap from human performance. Silver data augmentation improves zero - shot performance. Error analysis shows models struggle with rhetorical questions and identifying speakers. MeetingQA is challenging for existing QA models in both fine - tuned and zero - shot settings.</sample>

They created a benchmark dataset based on LAVA, covering different ambiguity types. Their framework uses a language model to generate clarifying questions or possible visual setups, and users answer to disambiguate prompts. They then use an automatic evaluation framework with a VQA model to check if images are faithful to user intention. Findings show positive effects of disambiguation and agreement between automatic and human evaluation. For more details, refer to their paper.</sample>

Coreference resolution aims to link mentions referring to the same entity. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity, while cache - based methods reduce it to linear. However, LRU eviction in long documents with topic switching leads to high cache misses. The speaker proposed a dual cache with a local cache using LRU and a global cache using LFU. The model scans the document left - to - right, classifying mentions and evaluating their frequency. Dual cache outperforms single cache methods on benchmarks and reduces cache misses. It also has the highest performance - cost ratio. Overall, dual cache is more effective and cost - effective than single cache methods.</sample>

    <sample id="192">Yang Luo gives a presentation on CAME, Confidence - guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization. He points out that traditional adaptive gradient - based methods like Adam triple the memory for gradient estimates, while memory - efficient methods like Adafactor reduce memory but sacrifice performance. The challenge is to design an optimizer with fast convergence and low memory usage. NMF is introduced as a memory - reducing technique, but Adafactor has errors in deep neural network training. Two scenarios are given to show how erroneous updates should be handled. CAME is proposed to decrease side effects from insecure updates. It uses the residual between predicted and generated updates to adaptively take an updating step. Experiments on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia show CAME outperforms Adam and Adafactor in terms of validation accuracy and memory usage. CAME also improves BERT - Large training and has comparable performance to the baseline on downstream tasks with less memory cost. It works well for large batch training, extending existing memory - efficient optimizers.</sample>

    <sample id="205">Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, presented their work on political biases in language models. They found that language models are trained on large web crawl data, including well - covered political news media like New York Times and Los Angeles Times. This has both good and bad sides. On one hand, diverse perspectives are learned, celebrating democracy. But on the other hand, social biases in political opinions can lead to fairness issues in downstream tasks.Their study investigates the political bias propagation pipeline. They evaluate language models' political leanings using political questionnaires and find that GPT - 4 is the most liberal. They also look at how different political leanings affect performance on tasks like hate speech and fake news detection. For example, left - leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting minorities but worse for powerful groups, and vice versa. This shows a pressing fairness issue regarding language model political leanings. They highlight the dilemma of not sanitizing political opinions in training data or risking censorship. It's a complex problem with no easy solution.</sample>

    <sample id="215">The talk discusses different dependency structures in coordination. In universal dependencies and Igor Mel'čuk's theory, the first conjunct is the head. In Prague approach, the conjunction is the head. In Hudson's Word Grammar, all conjuncts are heads. The aim is to argue for symmetric structures against asymmetric ones. The argument is based on dependency length minimization. In English, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb. When the governor is on the left or absent, the left conjunct tends to be shorter. This tendency grows with the length difference between conjuncts. When the governor is on the right, this effect disappears. The paper provides evidence from the Penn Treebank and shows how this supports symmetric structures of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="217">The work focuses on multi - attribute controllable dialogue generation. It addresses limitations of previous methods, like single - attribute focus and lack of unified evaluation. Contributions include DCG, a disentangled controllable generation model, and a unified reference - free evaluation framework, MAE. The model uses DialoGPT framework with compositional prompt module. It has attribute - oriented and task - oriented prompts. Experiments show DCG outperforms baselines in controllability and text equality. MAE is effective for evaluating different attribute granularities. The work proves the method's effectiveness in compositional generalization for multi - attribute controllable dialogue.</sample>

They focus on the Form 10 - K annual report, which contains important company activities. Their work is motivated by the similarity of words and yearly - dependent contents in these reports. They introduce a highlighting task and a multi - stage pipeline. Stage 0 is document segmentation, Stage 1 is relation recognition, and Stage 2 and Stage 2+ are out - of - domain and in - domain fine - tuning. They classify pairs into three types: β, revised, and mismatched. For model tuning, they use eSNLI for out - of - domain fine - tuning and revised pairs for intermediate fine - tuning. They evaluate using precision, recall, and PCC. Their domain - adaptive highlighting model performs well on FINAL and eSNLI datasets. They also observe benefits on simulation with mismatched pairs. Future work includes improving effectiveness and adding more features.</sample>

    <sample id="227">The audio discusses the current challenges in grounded language understanding for language models. It points out that most models are pre - trained without grounding, which makes the task difficult. Existing research often uses language models to directly generate plans, but this can lead to ungrammatical or invalid plans. The speaker proposes a novel framework called Pangu. In this framework, a symbolic agent proposes candidate plans, and a language model scores and ranks them. This way, the language model doesn't have to handle the validity and grammar of the plan. Pangu shows good performance across different settings and has strong sample efficiency. It also has strong generalizability under non - i.i.d. settings. The speaker suggests that discrimination might be a better strategy for grounded language understanding than generation. They invite discussions and collaborations.</sample>

Current models have problems like long training procedures and need different models for different latencies. The paper proposes EDAtt, Encoder - Decoder Attention. It uses existing offline ST models without re - training. It decides whether to emit partial translation based on attention. If the sum of cross - attention is below a certain threshold, it emits a word. The results show it outperforms other strategies in terms of translation quality and latency.

It starts with qualification settings, including pre - task qualifications like location, number of HITs, and HIT Approval Rate. The qualification task has two stages. The first stage tests annotators' ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly, categorizing them into gold, silver, bronze, and block. Only gold and silver workers pass. The second stage tests capacity for handling heavy workload. The reference - based task tests general performance on true annotation tasks. The pipeline workers show high agreement. Baseline MTurk workers use a statistical filter called MACE, but have incomplete HIT coverage. CloudResearch MTurk workers have lower task acceptance rate. The pipeline results in 6% of 200 participants being gold and silver. It's a best practice for high - agreement annotations at large scale and lower cost. Limitations include only English summarization on MTurk and no guarantee for training of correctness. Google provided the experiment funding.</sample>

    <sample id="254">The research presents a framework for document - level relation extraction with uncertainty - guided label denoising. It aims to improve the quality of distant supervision, DS, data. A pre - denoising DocRE model is trained with both DS and human - annotated data to generate pseudo labels. Uncertainty estimation is introduced to determine if model predictions can be trusted. An instance - level uncertainty estimation method is proposed for overlapping relations. A re - labeling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds is designed to filter pseudo labels with high uncertainty. A multi - phase training strategy is also developed to iteratively re - label DS data. The framework outperforms several strong baselines on public datasets. The main contributions include the uncertainty - guided label denoising framework, instance - level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations, an iterative re - labeling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds, and great performance improvements.</sample>

    <sample id="259">Yusen Zhang from Penn State University presents their work on XSemPLR, a cross-lingual semantic parsing system. Semantic parsing builds semantic representations like SQL and Lambda Calculus. Cross-lingual semantic parsing translates queries in multiple languages into representations. Existing models have limited coverage, especially for Chinese and certain meaning representations. XSemPLR provides a unified dataset with 9 datasets, 5 tasks, 8 representations, and 22 languages. It has six evaluation settings: Translate-Test, Monolingual Model, Monolingual Few-shot, Multilingual Model, Cross-lingual Zero-shot, and Few-shot transfer. Monolingual models like Encoder-PTR and Encoder-Decoder are evaluated. Encoder-Decoder performs best on all datasets. Cross-lingual transfer shows significant performance gap in Zero-shot but is reduced with Few-shot. XSemPLR is a comprehensive benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing. It shows interesting findings like the "Curse of Multilinguality" and the effectiveness of pretraining on English. The work is presented in a paper and code.</sample>

    <sample id="263">The work focuses on mitigating label biases in in - context learning for text classification. It identifies three types of label biases: vanilla - label bias, context - label bias, and domain - label bias. Experiments show that random in - domain words from the task corpus can bias model predictions, while random English words don't. Domain - context calibration is proposed to handle biases. It uses random in - domain words to estimate and calibrate the model's bias. This method improves in - context learning performance, especially on tasks with large domain - label bias. It outperforms previous calibration methods. The work aims to systematically investigate label bias problems and improve large language models' in - context learning.

    <sample id="264">Lin Wang, a Zhejiang University grad student, presents his paper "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation". He notes that uni - model text gen tasks like machine translation and image captioning have advanced due to large - scale pre - training and big models. But multimodal tasks like audio - visual text gen face data annotation challenges and domain shifts. He proposes Transferable Audio - Visual Text Generation to overcome these. The main challenge is multi - modal domain shifts like visual style and audio energy. He posits a unified audio semantic space for aligning visual concepts across domains.The framework has three components: an audio - visual meta - mapper network, an encoder and language model generator, and counterfactual contrastive learning. The meta - mapper network maps visual concepts to a unified audio semantic space. The encoder and generator use a transformer - based approach with an alpha to evaluate modality contributions. A Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning is proposed for better visual - textual alignment.The experiments on MSVD and MSR - VTT benchmarks show TAVT outperforms SOTA models on cross - datasets and cross - domain settings, even on low - resource domains. Ablation experiments analyze the impact of audio features on performance.</sample>

He first talked about the task of emotion regulation in conversations, which aims to predict the emotion label of each utterance. He pointed out existing challenges like not fully exploiting multimodal information complementarity, poor performance on minority emotion classes, and difficulty distinguishing semantically similar emotions.Then, he proposed MultiEMO. It has four key components: unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion, and emotion classification. He introduced VisExtNet for visual feature extraction, MultiAttn for multimodal fusion, and Sample - Weighted Focal Contrast loss for emotion classification. VisExtNet captures facial expressions without redundant scene info. MultiAttn integrates modalities through cross - attention. SWFC loss helps with minority and semantically similar emotions. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP showed state - of - the - art performance. However, VisExtNet can't distinguish speakers and irrelevant people, SWFC loss needs a large batch size on MELD, and performance in minority emotions is still worse than majority classes.</sample>

They analyze words with high P - CXMI in TED talk transcripts translated to 14 languages. They identify discourse phenomena like formality and lexical cohesion that need context. They create a MuDA tagger to identify these phenomena in a parallel corpus. When evaluating models with different metrics, context - aware models perform better for some phenomena but not others. DeepL is more accurate than Google Translate for document - level translation. This study helps in building a benchmark for document - level machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="282">Xuekai Zhu presents "StoryTrans: Non - Parallel Story Author - Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing" at ACL 2023. This work focuses on story - level style transfer, which is a step forward from token - or sentence - level studies. The main challenge is imitating author - specific discourse - level linguistic choices, like narrative techniques and styles associated with writing topics. To address this, StoryTrans is proposed. It learns discourse representations from source texts and combines them with style embeddings. A new training objective reduces stylistic features from discourse representations and enhances content preservation through two - stage generation. The first stage transfers source text with masked style - specific content keywords, and the second stage fills in correct style - specific contents. Extensive experiments on Chinese and English datasets show StoryTrans outperforms baselines in style control and content preservation. It can supplement short phrases to enrich storylines and rewrite sentences while maintaining source semantics. The data and code are available in the repo.</sample>

    <sample id="285">Mingqi Gao from Peking University presents their work on factual error correction for dialogue summarization. They discuss two main solutions: introducing factuality - related objectives in the training or inference process, and designing an independent FEC model. FEC models are evaluated using factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE, but these have flaws. The current evaluation is vague and may not be reliable. The authors argue that introducing manually annotated reference corrections is necessary. They propose a new taxonomy of factual errors, with content - based and form - based classifications. Their evaluation framework, based on ERRANT, has three steps: alignment, classification, and comparison. They find that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets gives the best results. They also suggest combining human - annotated data with synthetic data. Current FEC models struggle with certain types of factual errors.</sample>

    <sample id="299">The work discusses improving NLI model robustness. It points out that NLI models rely on shortcuts, like high word - overlap in MNLI, which makes them perform well on in - distribution but not on out - of - distribution. Existing shortcut mitigation methods have limitations like requiring domain - specific knowledge and assuming learner - auxiliary shortcut similarity. The proposed minimax training method aims to reduce reliance on shortcuts. It focuses on hard training instances that could contradict dominant easy examples. The method uses a feed - forward network for the auxiliary and optimizes both models alternately. Evaluation on datasets like MNLI, FEVER, and adversarial test sets shows it improves out - of - distribution performance while maintaining in - distribution accuracy. It also examines if improvements transfer to larger models and synthetic shortcuts. If you have any thoughts on this, feel free to share during the poster session.</sample>

    <sample id="305">Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University, presented their work on weakly supervised learning. They explained that in weak supervision, data is labeled using weak sources like heuristic rules or crowdsourcing, which are cheaper but noisy. In weakly supervised learning, algorithms are proposed to train neural networks robustly under this noise. They found that clean validation data is necessary for WSL to work well, as without it, performance drops. Increasing clean validation samples helps, but direct fine - tuning on clean data can also achieve good performance. They recommend reporting model selection criteria, comparing with few - shot learning baselines, and considering continuous fine - tuning. Their code is open - sourced.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim talk about entity tracking in language models. They explain that for an agent to understand a discourse, it needs to track entities and their state changes. They argue that this is crucial for understanding longer discourses but there's no systematic investigation on what pre - trained language models can do. They face challenges in designing a task to evaluate entity state tracking abilities, like the model might predict correctly without entity tracking abilities due to common patterns in pre - training data or just learn simple associations. They designed a task involving boxes and objects. The model has to predict the contents of each box after state - changing operations. Their experiments show that most models just repeat the initial state, but text - davinci - 003 exhibits non - trivial tracking. They found that pre - training on code is important for this capacity. Smaller models can learn with direct fine - tuning, but randomly initialized models can't even with direct supervision. They have more results and analysis in their paper.

    <sample id="308">Jenny, a first - year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, presents her work NLPositionality. It characterizes design biases of datasets and models. The work was done with folks from the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI. The study focuses on design biases in NLP technology, like the one where a popular toxicity detection API works well for some but not for others due to cultural differences. Positionality, the perspectives of NLP researchers and model developers, can influence research outcomes. The work aims to study dataset and model positionality by comparing annotations with real users. The framework involves re - annotating data sets with diverse annotators and comparing annotations to models and datasets using a Pearson's R correlation score. The study found that NLP datasets and models are most aligned to English - speaking countries and people with a college education. Some populations are inevitably left behind. Recommendations include keeping a record of design choices and doing research with a perspectivist lens. For more, check out their dashboard and paper.</sample>

    <sample id="317">Peng Li from Fudan University presents their work "CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information Extractors". Information extraction aims to extract structured info from unstructured text. Previous models like T5 and GPT - 3 use text - to - text pre - training but have mismatched outputs during inference. CodeIE transforms the task into a code - to - code generation task. For named entity recognition, they design prompts to extract entities. They evaluate on datasets with T5, UIE, GPT - 3, and Codex models. CodeIE using code - style prompts outperforms traditional text - style prompts in few - shot tasks. It has lower perplexity on text inputs and fewer structural errors. Codex generally outperforms GPT - 3 in information extraction tasks. Code format prompts also perform better in recall. The analysis provides insights for information extraction. If you have more questions, feel free to ask.</sample>

    <sample id="322">Enrico is presenting at ACL 23 on "What does a Text Classifier Learn about Morality?". He explains that morality is what helps distinguish right from wrong and is essential in society. Morality is often treated as a single scale between immoral and moral in NLP, but it's subjective. He mentions Moral Foundation Theory, which says there are five moral foundations we prioritize differently. He talks about using a Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus to study how morality is expressed differently across domains like #AllLives Matter and #BlackLivesMatter. He gives an example of how language models recognize that in ALM, subversion is frowned upon, but in BLM, it's somewhat encouraged. He warns that using just one model for many domains can lead to misunderstandings of morality. He hopes to see people at ACL in Toronto.</sample>

This work was done during an internship in the MSRIC group and supported by Intel Cognitive Computing Group.The goal of Vision - Language learning is to train an AI system that understands both images and text. Visual Question Answering is a famous VL task. Since 2019, large - scale self - supervised pre - training on image - text pairs and transformer - based models have made great progress. Recent works use a two - tower architecture with textual, visual, and cross - modal encoders. However, BridgeTower has limitations like ineffective layer - by - layer utilization and limited scalability.ManagerTower is proposed to overcome these. It uses RoBERTa and CLIP - ViT base as unimodal encoders. ManagerTower has managers in each cross - modal layer that gather insights from pre - trained unimodal experts at different levels. It can adaptively exploit different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge. ManagerTower outperforms METER, BridgeTower, and other models. It has superior performance on various downstream tasks,</sample>

    <sample id="333">The audio is about a work called "INK: Injecting kNN Knowledge in Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation". It focuses on improving neural machine translation by smoothing the representation space. The work acknowledges collaborators from Nanjing University and others. It points out that neural networks often have a non - smooth representation space, which limits generalization. The proposed kNN - MT smooths predictions based on nearest neighbors. However, it has drawbacks like time - consuming neighbor retrieval and difficulty updating the datastore. The INK framework is proposed to overcome these. It has two steps: extracting kNN knowledge to guide adapter adjustment and updating representations asynchronously. The framework aims to align contextualized representations to keep semantic meaning and address sparsely dispersing problems. Experiments show INK outperforms kNN - MT and brings larger performance improvements. It achieves higher BLEU scores with less memory and faster inference. The INK system has an average gain of 1.99 COMET score and 1.0 BLEU score compared to state - of - the - art kNN - MT systems.</sample>

    <sample id="337">The speaker presents a research on "Graph - based Relation Mining for Context - free Out - of - vocabulary Word Embedding Learning". They address the difficulty of representing out - of - vocabulary words, which are crucial for embedding - based models. When encountering an OOV word, they observe its word formation and associate it with relevant words to infer its meaning. They develop a Word Relationship Graph based on lexical rules. The OOV word is tokenized and associated with other words, forming a two - level graph. Each word or wordpiece is a node with its embedding as the node attribution. They use a self - attention network to assign attributes to OOV nodes. Two levels of Graph Attention Network are applied to extract important information. A readout block layer summarizes the graph information. They use a simple one - layer Graph Convolutional Network and contrastive learning in the loss function. Experiments show their model outperforms baselines. It can benefit static and contextual models. Agglutinative languages are well - suited, but fusional languages present more challenges. The model's performance with English is good through reasonable word segmentation. The speaker believes the model's application to other languages depends on rational word decomposition.</sample>
    <sample id="338">The research aims to evaluate the quality of human natural language explanations. It's a collaborative work from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research. They address the question of how to evaluate human explanations, which can be subjective and task - dependent. They use five datasets and two models to compare their proposed metric, TREU, with the simulatability score. TREU evaluates the helpfulness of explanations at fine - tuning. Their results show that human - annotated explanations can still benefit model predictions even if considered low quality by humans. The evaluation demonstrates that their metric outperforms the simulatability score. This work lays the foundation for high - quality human collaboration in annotation jobs.

They aim to create a large - scale, syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset. Their key idea is to use AMR graphs. They first get an AMR graph of a source sentence, change the focus node, modify edges and labels, and then generate text from the modified graph. ParaAMR has around 15 million source sentences and 6. 9 paraphrases per sentence. Compared to other datasets, ParaAMR generates more syntactically diverse paraphrases while maintaining good semantic similarity. It benefits NLP applications like learning sentence embeddings, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few - shot learning. ParaAMR is available at a certain link.</sample>

    <sample id="348">The paper "Marked Personas" by Myra, Esin Durmus, and Dan Jurafsky aims to measure stereotypes in large language models, LLMs. It addresses limitations of existing measures, like time - consuming hand - constructed data sets and limited generalization. The authors use instruction - tuned LLMs to generate personas based on prompts. They find that while the generated personas contain more stereotypes than human - written ones, the distribution of words differs. Positive - seeming words like "culture" and "proud" reflect harmful patterns. The paper reveals how seemingly positive portrayals contribute to discrimination and othering. It recommends researchers address positive stereotypes and use an intersectional lens. Increased transparency about bias mitigation methods is also suggested.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The presentation is about the meaning of superhuman performance in NLU. It starts by mentioning that in the last five years, leaderboard - based evaluation has become standard in NLP. Systems achieving human - level or superhuman performance in benchmarks are called "saturated benchmarks". However, it's unclear what it means to outperform humans in tasks involving knowledge, reasoning, and inference. The paper investigates how reliably leaderboard scores compare models and humans. It analyzes SuperGLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. In SuperGLUE, humans rank 8th and are outperformed by systems on 6 out of 10 tasks. On SQuAD, humans are largely outperformed by systems. But there are errors in the datasets that make the comparison unfair. For example, systems and humans are evaluated on different sets. The paper argues that claims about superhuman performance are not yet grounded and provides recommendations to avoid mistakes and construct more reliable benchmarks.

    <sample id="351">The paper investigates the generalization of CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers in 2023. It observes that these models have been used for almost 20 years and raises questions about their generalization to modern data and what is needed for good generalization. The authors developed the CoNLL++ Dataset from Reuters News 2020 and fine - tuned over 20 models on CoNLL - 03 test sets and CoNLL++. They found that for good generalization, a better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine - tuning examples are needed. The performance drop is mainly caused by temporal drift, not adaptive overfitting. The conclusion is that CoNLL - 2003 taggers still work well in 2023. The paper calls for more research on improving model generalization.</sample>

It focuses on using counterfactual scenarios to improve compositional generalization for multi - step quantitative reasoning in question - answering tasks. State - of - the - art models struggle with more than two - step outputs due to memorizing spurious patterns. CounterComp mines counterfactual scenarios from training samples. It treats a sample as an anchor and finds positive and negative examples. Positive examples have no change in output with intervention, negative ones do. An auxiliary metric learning loss is added, with a dynamic margin. This improves performance on in - and out - of - distribution samples, especially when reasoning steps exceed two. It also helps the model attend to meaningful tokens. For more info, check the poster or contact the listed person.</sample>
