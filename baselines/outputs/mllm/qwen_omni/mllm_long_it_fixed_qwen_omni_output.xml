    <sample id="6">The abstract discusses a study on unifying multi-lingual and cross-lingual summarization into a Many-to-Many Summarization, M2MS, model. The researchers propose PISCES, a pre-trained M2MS model, which learns language modeling, cross-lingual ability, and summarization ability through a three-stage pre-training process. They conduct preliminary studies comparing M2MS with previous models in MLS and CLS tasks. The study shows that M2MS can better transfer knowledge across languages compared to other models. Additionally, they present an ablation study and a human study to evaluate different aspects of the model. The conclusion highlights the effectiveness of the multi-lingual model in M2MS settings, suggesting it can better transfer across languages than those trained in MLS and CLS settings.</sample>

The paper presents a new MLM objective designed to incorporate code-switching information into language models, which is particularly useful when high-quality LID tags are unavailable. The authors propose using probing classifiers to verify the effectiveness of their approach, specifically focusing on linear and conditional probing techniques. Linear probing is used to assess the amount of switch-point information encoded in the intermediate layers of the model, while conditional probing helps identify representations that are more predictive of switch-point information compared to a baseline. The results show that the amount of switch-point information increases with the proposed pretraining variants, supporting the claim that the new MLM objective enhances code-switching information in the final layer representations. This improvement is further supported by architectural changes and auxiliary loss criteria, which encourage the intermediate layers to encode language information more effectively. The authors hypothesize that these changes will enhance the switch-point information content, making code-switched pretraining more effective.</sample>

    <sample id="128">The paper discusses the KITMUS test, which evaluates knowledge integration from multiple sources. It involves researchers from McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research. The test focuses on how NLU models draw on various knowledge sources, including pretrain-time knowledge and inference-time knowledge. The authors highlight the importance of task-specific training for knowledge integration. They present three settings of KITMUS: Background-Pretrain, Background-Both, and Background-Inference. The Background-Pretrain setting assumes background knowledge is available at pretrain time, while the Background-Inference setting makes it only available at inference time. The Background-Both setting provides both types of knowledge. The authors also introduce a coreference resolution task to probe the ability to draw on pretrain-time and inference-time knowledge. They experiment with human study participants and coreference resolution models. The results show that task-specific training is necessary for knowledge integration. Models struggle to integrate inference-time background knowledge. The paper concludes that many models are unable to reason over knowledge from multiple sources and that task-specific training is crucial for knowledge integration.</sample>

The label denoising strategy involves an iterative process of re-labeling and re-training the model to filter out noisy labels. The experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing baselines on two public datasets.</sample>

    <sample id="258">The abstract discusses a study on whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as an alternative to human evaluations in natural language processing tasks. The study proposes using LLMs to rate text samples based on instructions given by human evaluators. The researchers conducted experiments to compare the ratings of LLMs with those of human evaluators, focusing on four attributes: grammar, coherence, likeability, and relevance. The results showed that while smaller LLMs (T0 and text-cur1001) did not show a clear preference for human-written texts, larger LLMs (text-davinci-003 and ChatGPT) showed a clear preference toward human-written stories. The study also explored the pros and cons of LLM evaluation compared to human evaluation, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of using LLMs for evaluation tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="284">This paper introduces FSUIE, a novel fuzzy span mechanism for enhancing universal information extraction. It addresses the limitations of existing UIE models by proposing a fuzzy span boundary learning approach, which alleviates the reliance on precise span boundaries. FSUIE utilizes a fuzzy span loss function to model the boundary distribution as a continuous probability distribution, focusing on local features rather than global ones. The model structure includes a fuzzy span attention mechanism and a fuzzy span loss layer, which together improve the model's ability to learn fuzzy span boundaries and adaptively focus on relevant information. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that FSUIE outperforms existing models in terms of F1 score and achieves better fuzzy span-awareness on small-scale datasets. Additionally, FSUIE shows faster convergence rates and greater generalization capabilities for domain-specific information.</sample>
    <sample id="285">The research presented in this paper focuses on the evaluation of Factual Error Correction, FEC, models for dialogue summarization. It highlights the limitations of current evaluation methods, particularly the use of factuality metrics, which are found to be unreliable and vague. The study proposes a new reference-based evaluation framework to address these issues. This framework includes manually annotated reference corrections for model-generated summaries, which are used to train FEC models more effectively. The paper also introduces a taxonomy of factual errors and form-based categories to enhance the evaluation process. Experiments conducted with FEC models demonstrate that reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yield the best results in terms of factuality metrics. The findings suggest that introducing human-corrected summaries during training can significantly improve FEC model performance. Combining human-annotated data with synthetic data is identified as a promising direction for future research.</sample>

Preliminary experiments show that CoS-E explanations are less helpful than ECQA on a baseline model, but fine-tuning with CoS-E can improve model performance. The presentation also speculates on the task and explanation style dependencies of human explanations and suggests that high-quality human annotations are expensive and difficult to acquire. Future work includes recommending similar quality checks for human explanations and evaluating their impact on model performance.</sample>

It highlights the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs) and the challenges posed by existing stereotype measures, such as the trade-off between specificity and generalizability, reliance on fixed datasets, and failure to account for intersectionality. The authors propose a method that generates personas using prompts, inspired by a study on human subjects, to overcome these limitations. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through persona examples generated by GPT-4, showing how it can capture nuanced stereotypes and intersectional identities. The paper also presents a method for identifying marked words in generated personas, which helps distinguish between marked and unmarked groups. The results show that generated personas contain more stereotypes than human-written ones, but the marked words method provides more specific insights into the portrayal of different groups. The paper concludes with recommendations for addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, emphasizing the importance of transparency and intersectional lens in bias mitigation.</sample>

The study uses the CoNLL++ dataset, which is a collection of Reuters news from 2020 annotated with CoNLL-2003 guidelines. The researchers fine-tuned over 20 models on CoNLL-2003 and evaluated them on both the CoNLL-2003 test set and CoNLL++. They found that larger models, better model architecture, and more fine-tuning examples are crucial for good generalization. The performance drop is attributed to temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting. The paper concludes that CoNLL-2003 taggers still work well in 2023 when fine-tuned appropriately.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper presents a method for generating code by asking clarification questions, addressing the challenge of input underspecification in code generation. The method introduces interactivity through clarification questions to gather more specifications, focusing on operation-level details. It proposes a pipeline for CQ-driven code generation, including a clarification need predictor, CQ ranker, and code generator. The method is evaluated on a synthetic dataset, showing improved performance compared to existing models. The paper also discusses potential challenges and future work, including improving the CQ ranker and exploring the use of CQAs in the pipeline.</sample>

**Introduzione**

Ciao! Sono Vasu. Oggi parleremo di come usare la transfer learning per risolvere il problema della dissonanza. La dissonanza è quando due elementi della cognizione, come pensieri, azioni o credenze, sono in contrasto. Per esempio, se sai che le sigarette possono ucciderti ma fumi comunque, c'è una dissonanza tra il pensiero e l'azione.

**Risolvere la dissonanza**

Per risolvere la dissonanza, possiamo usare la transfer learning. Ci sono due modi principali: il modello di trasferimento e il modello di apprendimento attivo. Il modello di trasferimento utilizza un modello pre-addestrato per iniziare, mentre il modello di apprendimento attivo cerca di trovare nuovi esempi per migliorare il modello.

**Apprendimento attivo**

L'apprendimento attivo cerca di trovare nuovi esempi per migliorare il modello. Ci sono diversi modi per farlo, come il random,</sample>

    <sample id="361">The research presented focuses on improving compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning tasks using a method called CounterComp. The study highlights the challenges in this area, particularly the difficulty for state-of-the-art models to perform well, especially with multi-step reasoning. The proposed CounterComp approach leverages counterfactual scenarios to enhance the model's ability to generalize across different types of questions and reasoning steps. It uses questions as counterfactual examples to guide the model's learning process, ensuring it attends to meaningful tokens and avoids memorizing spurious patterns. The method is shown to improve performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex quantitative reasoning tasks.</sample>
