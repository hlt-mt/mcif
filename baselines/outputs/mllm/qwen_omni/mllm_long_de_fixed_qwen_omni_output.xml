    <sample id="3">Sure! Here's the translation: "Text Simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group, such as people with reading problems or non-native speakers. To train a text simplification model, we require parallel pairs of text, for example, a pair of documents or sentences. As an example, here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex German sentence and its plain language translation. To simplify the sentence, different techniques are possible, such as lexical substitution, clause deletion, reordering, or word deletion. We now propose our new corpus DE-plain, because in recent years there were some problems with existing corpora. For example, these corpora are too small to train a text simplification model on. The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be error-prone in their alignments. Therefore, we propose our new corpus DE-plain, which is split into two subcorpora: DE-plain-APA and DE-plain-web. DE-plain-APA is based on news texts. In DE-plain-APA, we aligned 483 documents all manually, which results in roughly 30,000 parallel sentence</sample>

    <sample id="114">Sure, here's a concise summary of the abstract in 200 words or less:

The paper discusses the development of a new method for compressing multi-head attention (MHA) in large language models (LLMs) using a technique called Grouped Head Attention (GHA). The authors propose a two-stage training process: Group Constrained Training (GCT) and Voting-to-Stay (V2S). GCT divides attention heads into groups, making intra-group heads more similar and inter-group heads more separate. V2S then prunes heads within each group based on their performance, ensuring that only one head remains per group. This approach significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining performance on tasks like machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization. The paper also introduces a lottery ticket hypothesis, suggesting that networks contain subnetworks that achieve comparable test accuracy to the original network.</sample>

It introduces two main contributions: novel masked language modeling pretraining objectives and architectural changes with auxiliary loss criteria. The authors use probing classifiers to verify that the amount of switch-point information encoded in the intermediate layers has increased with their proposed pretraining variants. Linear probing cannot detect representations that are more predictive of switch-point information compared to a baseline. Conditional probing shows that representations are more predictive of switch-point information in certain intermediate layers of BERT than the final layer. The paper also presents results on QA and sentiment analysis tasks across different models and language pairs, showing that the proposed techniques improve performance. The authors hypothesize that probing classifiers can be used to further enhance the switch-point information content in the final layer representations, making code-switched pretraining more effective.</sample>

    <sample id="137">The paper introduces a novel language-guided floor plan generation task, focusing on the use of natural language instructions to generate floor plans. It proposes a large-scale dataset, T2D, that features floor plans with natural language instructions to describe user preferences. The authors use a Seq2Seq model with a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, initialized by a pre-trained language model T5, to better understand language instructions. The model is trained on artificial and human-annotated language instructions, with the latter generated from pre-defined templates. The paper evaluates the model's performance on unseen instructions and finds that it outperforms all baselines by a large margin regarding pixel-level IoU scores. The approach also allows artificial and human instructions to be mutually beneficial during training. The paper concludes by proposing a Seq2Seq model as a strong baseline and comparing it with several text-conditional image generation models.</sample>

First off, there's a title slide with the name of the presentation and the presenter's name. Then, there's a slide about why weakly supervised learning is important, mentioning things like alleviating annotation bottlenecks and dealing with noisy labels. Another slide talks about a common claim in recent work, which is that models can be trained on weakly supervised data and still perform well. There's also a slide about research questions, like whether clean validation data is necessary and how many clean samples are needed. And, of course, there are slides with main findings, showing how weakly supervised learning approaches benefit from more clean validation samples. The conclusion slide sums it up, saying that recent approaches require clean samples, overestimate their practicality, and that clean validation sets are indispensable. There are also some recommendations, like reporting model selection criteria, using few-shot learning as baselines, and always applying continuous fine-tuning.

    <sample id="258">The abstract discusses a study on whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as an alternative to human evaluations in natural language processing tasks. The researchers propose using LLMs to rate story fragments based on grammar, coherence, likeability, and relevance. They conducted experiments comparing LLM evaluations with human evaluations, finding that LLMs, especially larger ones like davinci-003 and ChatGPT, show a clear preference for human-written stories. The study also explores the pros and cons of LLM evaluation compared to human evaluation, highlighting that while LLMs can follow natural language instructions and conduct tasks, they may not fully replicate human evaluators' preferences or evaluations.</sample>
    <sample id="259">The research presented in this paper focuses on developing a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing, named XSemPLR, which includes 9 datasets across various domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 natural languages in 15 language families. The study evaluates different models, including Enc-Ptr, Enc-Dec, and mT5, under various settings such as monolingual, few-shot, and zero-shot training. The results indicate that Enc-Dec performs best in a monolingual setting, while mT5 outperforms previous work in a few-shot setting. The paper also explores the performance gap between monolingual and cross-lingual training, noting that multilingual models can significantly improve performance when trained on a mixture of languages. Additionally, the analysis of monolingual and multilingual training settings reveals insights into the effectiveness of different approaches for cross-lingual semantic parsing.</sample>

    <sample id="299">The presentation discusses improving the robustness of NLI models using minimax training. It highlights the issue of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations in data. The work proposes a training method to reduce this reliance and enhance out-of-distribution performance. The key insight is that NLI models struggle with under-represented hard examples that contradict shortcuts. The proposed approach, minimax training, learns an example weight distribution that emphasizes these hard examples. The learner optimizes for the NLI task, while the auxiliary maximizes the learner's loss by up-weighting hard examples. This method does not require prior knowledge of shortcuts and relies on the learner's training dynamics. The auxiliary is a feed-forward network, and the learner is optimized for the NLI task. The presentation also covers prior work, limitations, and main ideas of the approach.</sample>
