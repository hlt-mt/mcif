The text discusses the concept of multi-hop question answering, which involves answering questions that require multiple reasoning steps. It mentions that multi-hop questions typically require multiple reasoning jumps, each corresponding to a document in the corpus. An example given is a question about what 1988 Christmas comedy film Brian Doyle-Murray starred in, which requires finding all the movies he appeared in and then identifying the one from 1988.

The text also talks about retriever training, where retrievers are trained by maximizing the probability of ground-truth chains given questions. For a set of training examples, the goal is to maximize the probability of the ground-truth chain being retrieved.

Additionally, the text mentions that existing systems require thousands of examples of questions and ground-truth chains for good performance, which can be expensive, especially for low-resource domains and languages. It also highlights that state-of-the-art multi-hop retrievers fall under this paradigm.

Hello everyone, my name is Shuheng. Today, I'm going to present our paper, "Do CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Taggers Still Work Well in 2023?" Let's get started.

Our paper investigates the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task, or the NER task. We observed that models have been using CoNLL-2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years. This naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data? And when we develop new taggers, what is needed for good generalization? At the same time, if we do observe poor generalization, what causes the performance drop of these models? To investigate these problems, we developed the CoNLL++ dataset. This is a dataset that we collected from Reuters news from 2020 and annotated with CoNLL-2003 annotation guidelines. We then fine-tuned over 20+ models on CoNLL-2003. We evaluated them on both the CoNLL-2003 test set and CoNLL++. We calculated the percentage ΔF1 to assess generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="166">The paper presents a neural divide-and-conquer reasoning framework for image retrieval from linguistically complex text. It introduces a system that integrates visual and linguistic information to improve performance. The framework uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, inspired by human thinking processes, to break down complex reasoning tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. The system is designed to handle the challenges of image-text retrieval, particularly in scenarios where images are highly similar and descriptions are long. It employs two main systems: a visual-linguistic interactor and a neural-symbolic reasoner. The visual-linguistic interactor focuses on analogical reasoning, while the neural-symbolic reasoner handles abstract logical reasoning. The framework also incorporates a proposition generator to decompose complex proposition sentences into simpler ones, which are then used by the neural-symbolic reasoner to generate logical operations. The paper discusses the integration of different models, such as OFA, GPT, and BART, to enhance the system's performance. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential integration of neural symbolic calculation and dual-process theory to further improve the system's reasoning capabilities.</sample>

    <sample id="348">The paper discusses the use of natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models, focusing on the limitations of existing methods and the development of a new approach called "Marked Personas." It highlights the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs) and the challenges posed by existing stereotype measures, such as the trade-off between specificity and generalizability, reliance on fixed datasets, and failure to account for intersectionality. The authors propose a method that generates personas using prompts, inspired by a study on human subjects, to overcome these limitations. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through persona examples generated by GPT-4, showing how it can capture nuanced stereotypes and intersectional identities. The paper also presents a method for identifying marked words in generated personas, which helps distinguish between marked and unmarked groups. The results show that generated personas contain more stereotypes than human-written ones, but the marked words method provides more specific insights into the portrayal of different groups. The paper concludes with recommendations for addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, emphasizing the importance of transparency and intersectional lens in bias mitigation.</sample>

    <sample id="350">Il contenuto parla di un'analisi sulla performance superumana in NLU. Si evidenzia come la valutazione basata su leaderboard sia diventata comune, ma spesso i sistemi superano gli umani solo in compiti semplici o ricordosi di informazioni. Ci sono anche problemi come la fragilità dei modelli, l'assenza di generalizzazione e la sensibilità eccessiva a perturbazioni. Si discute dell'importanza di valutare la qualità del training e delle baselines umane, e si suggerisce di costruire benchmark più equi e trasparenti. In conclusione, si afferma che le affermazioni di superumanità non sono sempre fondate e si suggerisce di migliorare la valutazione.</sample>
    <sample id="351">The presentation discusses the effectiveness of CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers in 2023. It explores model architecture, model size, and the number of fine-tuning examples as factors affecting generalization. The main findings are that larger models and more fine-tuning examples lead to better generalization. The performance drop is attributed to temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting. The conclusion is that CoNLL-2003 taggers still work well, but improvements are needed in model architecture, size, and fine-tuning examples.</sample>

    <sample id="361">The audio discusses a presentation on compositional generalization in multi-step quantitative reasoning. It introduces a method called CounterComp that uses counterfactual contrast to improve this process. The presenter, Armineh Nourbakhsh, explains how CounterComp addresses challenges like memorizing spurious patterns in neural models. The method involves mining counterfactual scenarios from the input to guide the model's attention to meaningful tokens. The presenter highlights that CounterComp consistently improves performance, especially with more reasoning steps, and enhances the model's ability to generalize across different tasks. The presentation also touches on how CounterComp performs on unseen samples and its potential applications in various domains.</sample>
