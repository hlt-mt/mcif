    <sample id="2">The paper presents a novel multi - pre - training model, Layout - Mask, for visual - rich document understanding. It focuses on forms, receipts, and posters. Existing models suffer from reading order issues. Layout - Mask uses text and layout information, enhancing text - layout interactions and layout representation learning. It differs in three aspects: local - 1D projection, whole - word masking, and layout - aware masking. The model infers global reading order by jointly using 1D projection, 2D projection, and semantic information. It also introduces a new pre - training objective, Marks Position Modeling. Experiments show Layout - Mask outperforms other models on SPOT - D and SRL - E datasets, with similar performance on CORD. This model promotes text - layout interactions and helps learn better layout representations.</sample>

    <sample id="6">The work presents a unified approach to multilingual and cross - lingual summarization called many - to - many summarization. It aims to build a single model that can summarize a document in any source language and generate a summary in any target language. The authors conduct preliminary studies to analyze multilingual, cross - lingual, and many - to - many summarization. They find that many - to - many summarization helps the summarization model transfer task knowledge better across languages. A pre - training method named PACTS is proposed for the many - to - many summarization model, which learns language modeling, cross - lingual ability, and summarization ability through a three - stage pre - training process. The work also compares multilingual, cross - lingual, and many - to - many summarization on the WikiNews dataset. The results show that many - to - many summarization performs better in transferring task knowledge. The paper also includes ablation studies and human studies to verify the effectiveness of PACTS.</sample>

For example, ChatGPT can tell jokes like "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything." However, they struggle with explaining jokes well. The New Yorker Caption Contest data is used for three tasks: matching, quality ranking, and explanation generation. The best model achieves around 62% accuracy on matching, compared to humans' 94%. Models like GPT-4 perform poorly even with human - authored image descriptions. This highlights a big gap in humor understanding between humans and language models.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presents his work on adaptive inference in low - resource settings. Adaptive inference reduces inference time of large language models by using low - capacity models for easy samples. Two common methods are multimodel and early exit. Multimodel stores multiple models, each with a classifier, trained separately. Early exit fits classifiers to intermediate layers, all trained together. Multimodel is versatile but expensive and suffers from overhead. Early exit is faster and memory - efficient but can lead to lower performance due to conflicting gradients. The study compares multimodel classifiers with early exit models and finds that multimodel classifiers outperform early exit by an average of 2.3%. Sweet is a novel finetuning method for early exit architectures that avoids conflicting gradients. It trains an early exit architecture where each layer only receives updates from the following classifier. Sweet closes most of the gap between early exit and multimodel but can negatively affect later classifiers in some cases.</sample>

To solve these, a graph information bottlenecks - guided feature refinement is proposed. Multimodal topic information is considered as additional semantic supplementary. The method consists of five parts: representing text and image, merging visual and textual syngraphs into a unified backbone cross - model graph, screening the initial graph, enriching compressed features with multimodal topic features, and evaluating on a widely used MRE dataset. The proposed method outperforms text - based methods and other multimodal baselines. It shows that information screening and compensating contribute to task performance, and the syngraph is beneficial for structural modeling of multimodal inputs.</sample>

    <sample id="19">The work focuses on efficient open - domain question answering. It presents a two - stage model proposed by Chen in 2017. The first stage uses a retriever to retrieve evidence contexts from the Wikipedia corpus, and the second stage uses a reader to understand the question and retrieve evidence for reasoning. The Wikipedia corpus is pre - processed into an index file by the document encoder. Challenges include the large size of the corpus, the bottleneck of inference speed due to the index file, and the need for multiple language models with millions of parameters. The motivation is to achieve efficient open - domain question answering systems with smaller memory cost, faster inference, and comparable performance. Core techniques include efficient retrieval and reading, as well as one - stage frameworks like the retrieve - only and generate - only systems. Efficient techniques are summarized from several aspects, such as approximate nearest neighbor search for evidence retrieval, skipping - read for fast reading, and document filtering and embedding dimension compression for index file reduction. The model size can be reduced by selecting lightweight models, parameter sharing, or designing fewer models. Existing open - domain question answering models are compared in terms of data, showing that retrieve - and - read systems perform well - balanced in speed, memory, and performance.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Dan Garrett discusses improvements in text - image models. These models have made progress in generating high - quality images but struggle with representing text accurately. The Imagine model uses a T5 - XL encoder and a diffusion model. T5 uses sentence - piece tokenization, which can lead to poor spelling accuracy, especially for frequent words. Larger T5 models perform better but still have issues. Palm models spell better but are impractical due to size and data requirements. Byte - T5, which receives individual bytes, performs well in spelling. Garrett's team augmented the Imagine model by adding a Byte - T5 - small model representation. This small addition improved text rendering.</sample>

The team from AI2 and USC presents findings that suggest using a single top model isn't optimal for all input examples. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. LLM Blender proposes a two - stage framework. In the first stage, it runs multiple models on an input and uses a pairwise ranking module, ParRanker, to compare outputs. ParRanker encodes pairs of candidates and the input for better analysis. In the second stage, it selects top - k candidates and uses a sequence - to - sequence model for generative fusion. The framework is evaluated on a new dataset, Mixed Instruct, showing better performance than other models on various metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="32">Hi, my name is Matthias Lindemann and today I'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi - set tagging and latent permutations. This is joint work with my advisors Alexander Koller and Ivan Titov.Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training. In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this. As usual, we have a training set of utterances, in this case, "the girl slept" and "Mary knew that the girl slept". These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning. In contrast to standard machine learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms. In this example, the model has seen shallow recursion during training and is tested on an example with deeper recursion.Naive sequence - to - sequence models struggle with this kind of out - of - distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input. In particular, they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output, such as those that are color - coded in the example.A popular</sample>

    <sample id="34">The work presents Crest, a joint framework for rationalization in counterfactual text generation. It combines selective rationalization and counterfactual editing. The rationalizer model generates rationales for the original input, which are then used to create counterfactual examples. These examples are evaluated by humans for validity and naturalness. The framework also explores using Crest for data augmentation. An alternative approach is proposed that performs rationalization with both factual and counterfactual examples. This approach shows promising results in improving downstream models. The rationales generated by Crest are analyzed for their interpretability in terms of possibility, forward similarity, and counterfactual similarity. Overall, Crest demonstrates the potential to produce high - quality counterfactuals and improve model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="35">Hello, I'm David, a PhD student at Saarland University in Germany. In this video, I would like to present our recent work, "Bigger than you think: A critical look at weakly supervised learning." This is joint work with Xiaoyu Shen, Mario Smuth, and G. Stefan and D. T. Clarke. I'd like to begin with a brief introduction to weak supervision and weakly supervised learning. In weak supervision, you do not manually label the data. Instead, we label the data using weak labeling sources, such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low - quality crowdsourcing, as illustrated in the figure on the right. When compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect. If we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize. In weakly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise so that the trained models still generalize well. In recent works in WSL, so WSL stands for weakly supervised learning, a common claim is that people say that they only train models on the weakly</sample>
    <sample id="36">The abstract is about a study on multilingual machine translation. It discusses the advantages of multilingual models like scalability, speed, and less error cascade. However, it also mentions limitations like limited capacity for languages. The solution proposed is Language - Specific Layers, LSLs. These layers are used to increase capacity for languages where it matters most while keeping inference costs constant. The study shows that LSLs can be placed in the encoder, and the model learns the best placement. The experiments on the WMT 21 news translation dataset show that the learned architecture outperforms language adapters and the largest baseline model, with faster inference time.</sample>

    <sample id="54">The work presented at ACL 2023 focuses on transfer learning for dissonance detection, addressing the rare class challenge. It starts by defining cognitive dissonance as inconsistent beliefs or actions, like a person knowing cigarettes are harmful but still smoking. This is important for understanding disagreement, belief changes, and mental health. The researchers conducted a large - scale annotation of dissonance relations using a dissonance - first approach. However, due to the rarity of dissonance, they faced the problem of absolute rarity. To overcome this, they experimented with combinations of transfer learning and active learning. They transferred weights from related tasks like topic - independent dissonance stance classification and binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of PDB. This improved the initial model's performance. They also used a probability of rare class strategy, PRC, to select mostly dissonant examples. Overall, the work aims to better understand and detect cognitive dissonance in language.</sample>

It aims to compress large language models while preserving performance. The study explores different approaches, including using smaller versions, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Two main types of knowledge distillation are discussed: word - level and sequence - level. The study contrasts with previous works focusing on classification tasks or specific tasks like translation. It conducts a task - specific study on realistic setups, considering various NLG tasks like summarization, question generation, commonsense reasoning, and simplification. The setups are industry - driven, with medium - sized labeled data, large unlabeled data, and medium - sized shared models. The study has eight stages, comparing different architectures, exploring the impact of pruning, and comparing different knowledge distillation approaches. It also extends the use of pseudo - targets, showing the importance of unlabeled data and the benefits of generating multiple pseudo - targets.</sample>

    <sample id="66">The survey paper discusses deep learning for mathematical reasoning. It highlights the importance of mathematical reasoning in human intelligence for comprehending and making decisions based on numeric data and language. The development of machines capable of solving math problems and proving theorems has been a long - standing focus of AI and NLP. There are two primary categories to study: visual contexts and table contexts. Solving geometry problems is an essential part of high school education, which can be formalized as a neural symbolic reasoning problem. Another important line of mathematical reasoning is automatic theorem proving. Some datasets have been proposed to probe the human - level intelligence of language models. Various neural network architectures have been proposed for mathematical reasoning tasks. For example, a second - to - sixth model uses an encoder - decoder architecture. Mathematical expressions can be represented as tree - based structures, and 6 - to - tree models have been proposed to explicitly model the tree structure. Pre - trained language models, such as large - scale language models, have demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. They can be applied to solve math word problems. However, they still face limitations, like the lack of ability to perform precise mathematical reasoning. One effective solution is to replace the greedy decoding strategy with self - consistency.

    <sample id="67">The study explores interference in multilingual translation models. It finds that severe interference occurs when the model is small compared to the data size. Tuning the sampling temperature is crucial for strong performance. For simple bilingual cases, there are scaling laws for model and data size. However, in multilingual cases, factors like data size of other languages, language similarity, and total number of languages can impact performance. But it turns out that language similarity and number of languages have less impact. The study defines interference as the relative difference between bilingual and multilingual model losses. Four transformer architecture variants were used in experiments. With 15 languages from WMT, it was found that language similarity is not a dominant factor for interference. Severe interference is mainly seen in parameter poverty settings. Temperature sampling is a simple solution, with a common value of 5 often used without calibration. The study concludes that model and data size affect interference levels significantly, while other factors have less impact. Modest scale and tuned temperature can reduce interference problems.</sample>

The goal is to handle indirect references, like "the newer one" or "the song that's not energetic, " which can be more natural in conversation. The dataset covers music, books, and recipes, collected using crowd annotation. It uses a cartoon completion setup with three speech bubbles. The first bubble sets the dialogue context, the second presents an alternative question, and the third uses an indirect reference. The second question is generated from a simple template with entities sampled from Wikipedia. Different sampling methods are used to make disambiguation harder. Background knowledge is provided to annotators for songs, recipes, and books. The annotators then pick an entity and describe it using indirect referring expressions. This corpus is important for conversational systems and entity understanding benchmarks.</sample>

    <sample id="74">The paper introduces Dens atomic, a knowledge graph with high logic coverage and massive multi-hop paths. It is a large - scale commonsense knowledge base that covers event - centered social aspects of information. Dens atomic improves upon Atomic by adding missing links like B2A, B2B, A2B, and A2A links. It also has more multi - hop paths. The construction of Dens atomic involves three parts: normalized tail events, training a relation prediction model, and constructing Dens atomic. The normalized tail events convert tail events into the same expression as the head event. The paper proposes RST - KGC, a method to predict relations given head and tail events. It avoids sparse graph structure and utilizes semantic information. RST - KGC is computationally efficient and performs well compared to other relation prediction methods. Dens atomic outperforms Atomic in terms of logic coverage and multi - hop path accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="75">The work presented is a joint semi-supervised learning framework for entity and relation extraction. It aims to address the issue of ignoring the interconnections between these two tasks. The framework consists of four parts: span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. In span feature generation, label tokens are used to generate representations for spans and span pairs. For graph construction, a K - nearest neighbor graph is built for computational efficiency. Label propagation then diffuses labels through the graph, refining pseudo - labels for entities and relations. Finally, the model is optimized by retraining with the refined pseudo - labels. This framework considers the interconnections among both labeled and unlabeled data, aiming to fully integrate all information for better performance.</sample>

    <sample id="77">This work from Yale University and Microsoft Research focuses on improving summarization factual consistency using natural language feedback. They introduce a new dataset called DeFacto, which includes human demonstrations and feedback. The dataset is used to propose three new NLP tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. The study specifically examines abstractive text summarization, ensuring all summary information is supported by the input document. Human annotators provide labels and corrected summaries if the original is factually inconsistent. They also offer explanations, instructions, and evidence for their judgments. The data is collected on the XSum dataset, with around 2.5k data points, 70% containing factual errors. The human-edited summaries receive higher automatic factual scores but have lower textural overlap with reference summaries. The work shows that both fine - tuned models and zero - shot large language models can effectively leverage human feedback for summary editing. Feedback generation remains challenging. The third task is to automatically correct factual errors while generating explanations.</sample>

Two existing works are mentioned: one using the number of unique terms as a heuristic quality signal, but its clustering process is uncontrollable. Another uses word count as weak supervision, but direct regulation also leads to poor performance. The video proposes a novel framework, URA, for unsupervised AES. URA introduces multiple heuristic quality signals as pseudo ground truths. It has a heuristic essay ranking module, HER, that generates partial order pairs by ranking essays according to different quality signals. A deep pairwise rank aggregation module, DPR, trains a neural AES model by aggregating these partial order pairs into unified supervision. The model can learn to judge essay quality relationships. In the inference stage, a scoring strategy is proposed to transform predicted scores into predefined score ranges. Experiments show URA outperforms other unsupervised baselines.</sample>

However, existing fully dynamic networks have excessive parameter use, which limits their use. The authors propose a framework called Pannet that partitions parameters into dynamic and static, using scale factors to control their intensity. Experiments show Pannet outperforms static and fully dynamic networks while maintaining fewer parameters and less computation. Omission studies find optimal dynamic ratios for dynamic convolution and mixture of experts. Scale factors for dynamic and static parameters are crucial for accuracy.</sample>

Results showed that learner - annotated data was nearly as accurate as native - speaker - annotated data, especially for simpler tasks.

    <sample id="100">Multi-hop QA involves answering questions that require multiple reasoning steps, each step corresponding to a document in the corpus. For example, to find a 1988 Christmas comedy film Brian Doyle-Murray starred in, one first needs to identify all movies he was in and then find the 1988 one. Multi-hop retrievers are trained to maximize the probability of the ground truth chain given a question. Existing systems need thousands of examples for good performance, which can be expensive, especially for low - resource domains. Our approach, prompt rank, is efficient and performs well with just 128 examples. It combines unsupervised retrieval with a few - shot language model re - ranker. First, a pool of candidate chains is retrieved using TF - IDF and hyperlink traversal. Then, these candidates are re - ranked using the language model. The scoring function is the likelihood of the question given the chain. A chain prompt is constructed, and the chain is scored by the probability of the question given the chain prompt. The prompt rank approach outperforms fully supervised systems and performs comparably to state - of - the - art multi - hop dense retrievers. It also learns ablation to verify the importance of each component.</sample>

    <sample id="106">The paper "Quest" presents a dataset for studying selective information needs. It includes 13, 000 entity - seeking queries with implicit set operations. The queries are verified for relevance, and documents are marked with spans for different query constraints. The dataset is challenging for retrieval systems due to the need to search a large document corpus for multi - answer sets. Queries with set intersection and set difference are particularly difficult. The dataset is constructed using Wikipedia category names from four domains. Human annotators paraphrase and validate the queries. The dataset is used to evaluate systems that can retrieve multi - answer sets from a large document corpus with implicit set constraints. Sparse and dense retrievers, as well as a T5 - based retriever, are considered as baselines. The results show room for improvement in retrieval performance, especially for queries with set intersection and set difference.</sample>

    <sample id="108">The paper discusses the limitations of language model acceptability judgments in the minimal pair paradigm. It revisits this paradigm to evaluate models on longer sequences, as large language models are using longer context windows. The authors simulate longer sequences by choosing acceptable and unacceptable sentences from relevant datasets, and also from unrelated domains like Wikipedia. They find that MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context length when sentences are from unrelated domains. However, when sentences are from the same dataset, judgments significantly change with acceptable or unacceptable prefixes. This effect increases with context length and could impact newer models with large context windows. The authors analyze why the match prefix affects judgments so much by perturbing the input sentence while preserving its structure.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The paper introduces a natural instructions dataset for instruction - tuning language models. It's a fully automatic collection of instructions, inputs, and outputs without human annotations. The process involves prompting a pretrained model, like a variant of GPT - 3, to generate examples. The dataset contains 64k examples, with about 240k when instruction paraphrases are considered. It's analyzed for creativity, diversity, and correctness. More than 50% of the examples are correct, and even incorrect ones have valuable information. The dataset outperforms T0 and T5 on several benchmarks when finetuned on an 11 billion parameter T5 model. It shows language models' ability to produce creative and diverse data, which is hard to achieve with crowdworkers. This dataset is faster and cheaper than human annotation.</sample>
    <sample id="110">In this paper, we define the problem of constrained language planning, which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning. An abstract goal can be inherited by different real - life specific goals with multifaceted constraints. A good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints. In this paper, we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models. Since no dataset of specific goals exists to support our study, we have to acquire these goals first. As shown in the table, we extend the abstract goals with multifaceted constraints for human - in - the - loop data acquisition using InstructGPT. We sample 100 specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from large language models. This table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all large language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals. Then we conduct detailed analysis to investigate why large language models fail. Results in the figure show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed. We dig into a more fine - grained topical categories of constraints defined in WikiHow. The heatmap in the figure shows that the planning performance of InstructGPT varies considerably for goals of different categories. Previous studies have</sample>

The second stage is the Voting to Stay algorithm, which prunes redundant heads within each group. The method achieves significant parameter compression, up to 90% in extreme cases, while maintaining good performance on tasks like machine translation, language modeling, and abstract summarization.</sample>

It defines code - switching as a phenomenon where words from different languages are mixed in a sentence, like "laptop made a bag made a kite" in English and Hindi. The authors note that existing multilingual pre - trained models like M - BERT and X - LAMA perform poorly on code - switching tasks such as question - answering and sentiment analysis.The main contributions are proposing novel MLM techniques, like Switch MLM, which is tuned for code - switching. This involves defining switch points as groups of two tokens that transition between languages. The authors also offer a surrogate method called Frequency MLM. Architectural modifications are proposed, including residual connections and an auxiliary LID - based loss. These help the model encode more switch point information. Results show that the combined method, including Switch MLM, Frequency MLM, residual connections, and an auxiliary loss, performs best on sentiment analysis tasks.

    <sample id="123">The research focuses on improving multimodal zero - shot learning via instruction tuning. It aims to investigate if instruction tuning on multimodal pre - trained models can enhance generalization to unseen multimodal tasks. There's a significant disparity in instruction dataset availability between NLP and multimodal tasks. To address this, they built Multi - Instruct, the first multimodal instruction - tuning benchmark dataset with 62 diverse tasks from 10 broad categories. Using OFA as the base model, they show that instruction tuning can significantly improve OFA's performance on seen multimodal tasks. Transfer learning from the Natural Instruction dataset also benefits instruction tuning. As the number of tasks increases, the model achieves better performance but lower sensitivity. Using more instructions improves overall performance and reduces sensitivity. This demonstrates the effect of different fine - tuning strategies on model sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="124">The work by Tan Qi from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba focuses on benchmarking and improving temporal reasoning capabilities of LMs. It breaks down temporal reasoning into three levels: time - to - time, time - to - event, and event - to - event. The first level deals with simple time calculations. The second level involves understanding events in relation to time, like what team Messi played for in 2010. The third level requires reasoning about multiple events over time. They conducted a preliminary experiment on L1 prediction of years, finding that some LMs had a bias towards the 2000 - 2020 time period. They proposed a Temp Reason dataset covering all three levels of reasoning and long temporal coverage. The dataset was evaluated in three QA settings: closed - book, open - book, and Reason QA. A new training strategy was proposed, including temporal span extraction pre - training and time - sensitive reinforcement learning. The final model, Time - T5, significantly outperformed other models in OBQA and Reason QA settings.</sample>

    <sample id="127">The paper introduces a method called "Large Language Models are Reasoning Teachers" for enabling smaller models to perform complex reasoning tasks. It addresses the limitation that chain - of - thought reasoning only works on huge models like GPT - 3 or PaLM. The authors propose using these large models as reasoning teachers to transfer their abilities to much smaller models. They also introduce a novel technique called diverse reasoning. They go through examples to identify if small models can do complex reasoning previously required by large models. The method involves applying chain - of - thought prompting on large models to generate step - by - step solutions, which are then used to fine - tune smaller models. The results show that the method significantly outperforms existing baselines on various tasks, especially for text - based ones. Diverse reasoning substantially increases performance. The method is highly scalable but comes with trade - offs like development time costs for larger datasets and teacher models, and inference time costs for student models.

    <sample id="128">The work presents a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration in natural language understanding models. It focuses on a coreference resolution task to evaluate models' ability to use knowledge from different sources. The dataset is evaluated with human participants and established models. Three settings are defined: background pretrain, background both, and background inference. The background pretrain setting assumes background knowledge is available at pretrain time, while the background inference setting has both knowledge types available only at inference time. The results show that models trained on the dataset perform better than random choice, suggesting they learn to exploit surface cues. However, even the best models struggle with integrating backward knowledge presented only at inference time. This highlights the need for task - specific training to improve knowledge integration in NLU models.</sample>

    <sample id="135">ABC eval is a new approach for evaluating conversational AI. It was developed by the Emory NLP lab and Amazon Alexa AI. Instead of relying solely on human evaluation, ABC eval annotates model responses for various behaviors like irrelevant information or contradictions. This method is more precise and reliable than existing ones. It measures rates of different errors in chat models. Four state - of - the - art chat models were evaluated on 100 human - bot conversations each. ABC eval labels were found to be more reliable and predictive of overall conversation quality compared to other methods. It enables a higher resolution evaluation of conversational AI. Challenges like common sense violations and irrelevant information production still exist. ABC eval can be useful for others in the field to compare models accurately.</sample>

They introduce Fermat, a flexible evaluation set based on arithmetic types, to test models' understanding of numbers, mathematical operations, and training dependency. Fermat includes math - worded questions extracted from Illinois Common Core, with numbers changed to mimic real - life scenarios. The evaluation shows that most models perform poorly across various aspects, and fine - tuning with math - teachers' templates improves performance.

    <sample id="146">The paper discusses the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization. It starts by introducing the background of dialogue summarization as a subtask of text summarization. It highlights the challenges in extracting key information from dialogues in different domains. Recent progress in dialogue summarization using large - scale pre - trained language models is mentioned, but their summaries often have factual errors due to omission. The authors analyze the omission problem systematically, finding that even state - of - the - art models have a high omission rate, around 70%. They also study the position distribution of omitted information, which is randomly distributed regardless of dialogue length and domain. To better analyze and solve the omission problem, they define the task of omission detection, focusing on utterance - level omission. They construct a new dataset, the ODS dataset, which provides high - quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. The dataset is built on five existing benchmarks and uses different models to generate diverse candidate summaries. An automatic method is proposed to produce omission labels, and human evaluation is also performed. Three frameworks are explored as baselines for omission detection models. The results show that the task is challenging, with an F1 score around 50%. Finally, the authors consider using omissions to refine summaries, using a post -</sample>

It highlights the unique aspects of meeting transcripts, such as their length, domain - specificity, and information richness. Prior work mainly focused on summarization and extracting action items, underutilizing the QA component. The Meeting QA dataset is introduced, containing 7, 700 questions split into train, dev, and test sets. It has a high inter - annotator agreement of 0.73. The dataset includes various question types and answer scenarios. The paper also discusses the data collection process, which involves public meeting transcripts from the AMI corpus. It shows that short - context models outperform long - context models in fine - tuned settings, while multi - span models have slightly less or comparable performance compared to single - span models. Zero - shot performance has a large gap from human performance, but silver data augmentation improves it.</sample>

He discusses valuable resources for ancient Greek and Latin and the implications of multilinguality in large language models. He mentions existing models like Latin BERT, Ancient Greek BERT, and another Ancient Greek BERT. These models are BERT - encoder - only and monolingual. He then talks about the lack of robust evaluation of these models and the need for new models specifically designed for classical philology. He introduces two monolingual models for Ancient Greek, GriBERT and GREATER, and multilingual models FilBERT and Filter, pretrained on Ancient Greek, Latin, and English data. He explains how they gathered pre - training data from Open Greek and Latin, Internet Archive, and other resources. He also discusses benchmarking the models on tasks like part - of - speech tagging, dependency parsing, and lemmatization. The models outperform the current state - of - the - art for both Ancient Greek and Latin. He analyzes the performance of GREATER's encoder and shows that it behaves differently from native encoder - only models. He also discusses the performance gains in lemmatization and the models' semantic and world - knowledge capabilities.</sample>

The disambiguated prompts are then input into a text - to - image model to generate images. An automatic evaluation framework is also proposed to check if the generated images are faithful to the user's intention. The findings show that the framework has a positive effect on faithful generation and is in agreement with human evaluation.

It achieved state - of - the - art performance in many tasks when it was published. The study presents the first systematic look at prompting for machine translation. They evaluated the translation quality using the best practices of the AMT community. They compared Palm to state - of - the - art systems and used state - of - the - art metrics. They also showed expert - based human evaluation results. Palm's performance can be significantly influenced by the prompting strategy. A simple experiment showed that using different prompts for the same sentence can lead to a difference of more than one BLEU point in extreme cases. They settled on a 5 - shot prompting strategy. The quality of the examples used for prompting is more important than their similarity to the source sentence. Selecting prompts from high - quality translations, especially from the dev data, leads to better performance. Specialized state - of - the - art systems have a substantial advantage over Palm, but Palm is close to commercial systems like Google Translate.

    <sample id="157">The work introduces a dialogue summarization method using a static - dynamic structure fusion graph. It aims to distill silent information from dialogue context into a concise summary. The method has four main components. First, an utterance encoder encodes dialogue context utterances into vector representations. Then, a static graph is constructed using existing dialogue structure modeling methods. A static - dynamic graph module combines multiple static graphs and captures semantic relationships between utterances based on their deep vector representations. Finally, a pre - trained language model generates the summary by fusing static and dynamic dialogue structures. The static dialogue structure is captured through four heuristic methods: discourse parsing graph, key co - occurrence function, speaker relationship modeling method, and positional graph. This model is designed to overcome the drawbacks of relying on external linguistic tools and fixed static graph structures.</sample>

Coreference resolution aims to identify and cluster mentions referring to the same entity. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity, while cache - based methods use a fixed - size cache to reduce complexity to linear. However, in long documents, topic shifts cause high cache miss with LRU policy. The proposed dual cache has a local cache with LRU eviction policy for local entities and a global cache with LFU policy for global entities. The model scans the document left - to - right, classifying new mentions and evaluating their frequency. Dual cache outperforms single cache methods in benchmarks, reducing cache miss and having the highest performance - cost ratio. It effectively handles long documents with topic shifts.</sample>

    <sample id="165">The paper presents an approach to adaptive reasoning. It starts with a context, like Emily being stuck in traffic, and an outcome, like Emily making her flight. There are possible explanations given, such as her flight being delayed or leaving on time. The goal is to find a plausible explanation that bridges the gap between the context and outcome. The paper considers a closed - world setting where a set of explanations is given. Current approaches rely on supervised methods which need the annotation of plausible explanations, but this can be noisy and subjective. The paper proposes an unsupervised learning method called LiPoR, which stands for Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization. It treats explanations as a latent variable and aims to maximize the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context. However, it also needs an additional regularizer to prefer plausible explanations. This regularizer enforces mutual exclusivity among explanations. The LiPoR objective consists of maximizing the likelihood of outcomes and preferring some explanations over others. The regularizer, denoted by Omega, takes the max between the entropy of P of Z given X, Y, and the log of M, where M is the number of plausible explanations.

    <sample id="166">The paper introduces a new divide - and - conquer learning framework for image retrieval from linguistically complex texts. It addresses the challenge of highly similar images and long descriptions. Traditional methods like visual language models perform well on image - sentence retrieval but fail on complex texts. The framework is inspired by divide - and - conquer strategy and dual - process theory. It uses a proposition generator to decompose complex propositions into simple ones. System 1, the visual - linguistic interactor, performs visual - propositional information interaction. System 2, the neural symbolic reasoner, integrates reasoning states and results of simple propositions. The final solution is obtained by combining the results of System 1 and System 2. Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms baselines. The method is process - interpretable and suggests that neural symbolic calculation could improve large language models' compositional reasoning and planning capacity. Divide - and - conquer is compared to self - asking to decompose complex reasoning into simple problems.</sample>

    <sample id="181">This paper introduces a work on distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning. It focuses on planning for goals with specific constraints, unlike previous work which mainly dealt with abstract goals of stereotypical activities. The authors define the problem of constrained language planning, which involves different constraints on planning goals. They evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models. To acquire specific goals, they extend abstract goals with multifaceted constraints and use InstructGPT to generate scripts. They find that all large language models perform unsatisfactorily on planning for specific goals. Detailed analysis reveals that while the semantic completeness of generated scripts is acceptable, faithfulness to constraints cannot be guaranteed. They then propose an over - generated then filter method to improve generation quality. This method involves showing constraint types to InstructGPT, over - generating scripts, and using a filter model to select faithful scripts. The authors also introduce a dataset named CoScript for constrained language planning, which is generated from large language models using symbolic knowledge distillation. This dataset is used to ensure the quality of validation and test sets through crowd - sourced workers. The abstract shows that CoScript has a high constraint distribution, indicating its potential for further research in constrained language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="192">The presentation is about a new optimizer called CAM for large language model training. It aims to balance fast convergence and low memory usage. It introduces NMF as a preliminary, which reduces memory requirements. However, NMF - based AdFactor has errors in deep neural network training. CAM addresses this by considering the residual between MT and UT to adaptively take an updating step. Experiments on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia show CAM outperforms Adam and AdFactor in validation accuracy with the same number of steps. It also performs better than Adam in pre - training for large models with reduced memory cost. With larger batch size, CAM enhances training more than Adam and AdFactor.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The work introduces a framework for explainable question answering, ROHT, Reasoning Over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree. It addresses limitations of existing methods like neural - symbolic and decomposed - based approaches. ROHT builds a hierarchical question decomposition tree, HQDT, for complex questions. It uses probabilistic reasoning to fuse knowledge from knowledge bases and text corpora at different levels of the tree. The framework solves complex questions by recursively reasoning from the root to leaves. Evaluation on KQA - Pro and Music datasets shows that ROHT outperforms existing methods, especially when integrating knowledge from KB and text. This demonstrates the importance of integrating knowledge from heterogeneous sources for complex question answering.</sample>

    <sample id="205">The work presented by Zhang Bing, a PhD student at the University of Washington, explores the impact of political biases in language models. It starts by noting that language models are trained on large web crawl data, including political news media. This creates a mixed blessing - diverse perspectives are learned, but political biases are also present. The study investigates the political bias propagation pipeline from pre - training data to language models to downstream tasks. It evaluates the political leanings of language models using political questionnaires and finds that models have varying political leanings, with GPT - 4 being the most liberal. Controlled experiments show that pre - training on partisan corpora shifts the ideological coordinates of language models. The study also examines whether language models pick up societal polarization, finding that models generally have a political leaning further from the center after 2017. When evaluated on hate speech and fake news detection, language models with different political leanings give different predictions based on social categories. This indicates a pressing fairness issue regarding political biases in language models, which could lead to marginalized groups being targeted without control if right - leaning models are deployed on social media platforms.</sample>

Are you copying my model? Protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding as services via backdoor watermark. Let's first introduce the background about embedding as services. Currently, large language models such as GPT, Llama, Palm, are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation. Embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various NLP tasks. For example, OpenAI offers a GPT - based embedding API. However, recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services. Therefore, it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services. To protect the copyright of embedding as services, one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contains the watermark. The watermark method need to meet the following properties. First, the method should be applicable to embedding as services. Second, the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings. Third, the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker, or the attacker can remove the watermark easily. Finally, the watermark need to</sample>
    <sample id="215">The talk discusses different dependency structures in coordination. Universal Dependencies and Egor Milchuk's theory assume the first conjunct is the head. The plug approach in plug dependency treebanks has the conjunction as the head. The multi - headed approach in the cut - sons word grammar has all conjuncts as heads. The aim is to argue for symmetric structures against asymmetric ones. The argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization. In English, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, but this can be ameliorated if the direct object is heavy and long. The paper extracts statistics from the enhanced Penn Treebank to confirm the observation that left conjuncts tend to be shorter when the governor is on the left. This tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left and absent in cases of coordination of two verbs without an external governor.</sample>

    <sample id="217">The work explores compositional generation of multi - attribute controllable dialogue. It addresses limitations of previous methods in handling multi - attribute generation. The proposed DCG, Distangled Controllable Generation, learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses a distangle loss for different attribute combinations. A unified reference - free evaluation framework, MAE, is introduced for different granularities of attributes. The models are based on the dialogue GPT framework with a compositional prompt module. Two types of prompts are designed: attribute - oriented prompt for instance - specific control signals and task - oriented prompt for instance - independent global features. The two prompt embeddings are concatenated to create whole prompt embeddings. A distanglement loss is introduced to train multiple compositional prompts. A unified and efficient evaluation framework is proposed, which does not require additional large - scale label data. The DCG outperforms other baselines in attribute controllability and test quality. It is tested with attribute - oriented prompts, task - oriented prompts, and distanglement learning. The results confirm the effectiveness of the method for transforming seen attributes to unseen combinations.</sample>

It focuses on the 10K SL target corpus, which is an annual report required by SEC. The goal is to find the rationale words between a given pair T and R. The pipeline includes document segmentation, relation classification, and out - of - domain and in - domain fine - tuning. For relation classification, pairs are classified into three types: Type A, B, and C. Type A has high syntactic and semantic similarities, Type B has similar syntactic patterns but different meanings, and Type C is like debut information. The model is trained using external data like ES and LI for out - of - domain fine - tuning and the revised pairs for in - domain fine - tuning. Two metrics, precision and PCC, are used to judge performance. The domain - attentive highlighting model achieves the best performance on final and preserves generalization capability. The methods can also benefit unseen relations and mismatch pairs.</sample>

    <sample id="222">This work explores challenges and interventions in open-domain question answering. It starts by looking at a question about Narora Kakrapur Tarapur and how relevant passages are retrieved from a general-purpose document corpus like Wikipedia. However, when trying to answer biomedical questions, the source model trained on Wikipedia struggles with biomedical-specific passages. The work makes three main contributions: investigating data interventions for out - of - domain generalization, identifying dataset shift types, and determining effective data interventions for specific shifts. It uses a setup with a general - purpose Wikipedia - based source domain and tests generalizability on seven target datasets across six domains. Two data intervention methods, zero - shot and few - shot, are examined. Zero - shot methods control interactions among question, answer, and context variables in a controlled manner. Few - shot methods use target domain examples to prompt large language models for generating more examples. The study observes improvements in retrieval and reader performance. The work also ascertains the nature of incompatibility between the target model and domain by considering a dataset shift taxonomy.</sample>

    <sample id="227">The abstract is about the challenges in grounded language understanding for language models. It states that current models lack grounding during pre - training, which is a major issue. The gap between pre - training and downstream applications makes it difficult. Existing research often uses language models to generate plans directly, but these plans may not always be grammatical or valid. A new framework called Pangu is proposed. It focuses on discrimination instead of generation, where a symbolic agent proposes candidate plans and a language model scores and ranks them. This separation helps with validity and grammar issues. Pangu is tested on large - base question - answering and achieves good performance across different settings and language models. It shows strong sample efficiency, especially with Codex. The findings suggest that Pangu is less prone to overfitting compared to autoregressive models like Ark and QA.</sample>

It starts by introducing the importance of text revision in professional writing, especially in argumentative writing where finding the right words is crucial for effective communication. The authors then discuss the challenges of determining when an argumentative claim is phrased well enough. They introduce two tasks: suboptimal claim detection and claim improvement suggestion. The work explores how to model the quality of argumentative texts based on implicit revision patterns from collaborative online debate platforms. It identifies four main challenges: representativity and reliability, model complexity and architecture, contextual dependence of argument quality dimensions, and topical and user bias. These challenges arise from the nature of revision - based corpora and the notion of argument quality. The paper aims to address these challenges to better understand and improve the quality of argumentative claims.</sample>

And in this minimal pair paradigm, the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence. And then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence.</sample>

The key is the cross - attention mechanism between audio input and text output. ADOT decides whether to emit partial translation based on attention concentration. If the sum of cross - attention weights towards the last lambda speech frames is below a threshold, words are emitted. Otherwise, they are not. The results show that ADOT outperforms other strategies in terms of translation quality and computational efficiency.

    <sample id="241">The paper discusses a human - in - the - loop evaluation for early misinformation detection, focusing on COVID - 19 treatments. It points out that existing approaches for automatically detecting misinformation on social media platforms have two key shortcomings. Firstly, they are unrealistically evaluated, with datasets often retrospectively constructed and prone to leaked counter - evidence. Secondly, they are not human - centric, not representing the real scale or noisiness of platforms and often cutting out humans from the misinformation detection process. The authors propose an evaluation framework for systems that address these deficiencies. Their system is end - to - end, going from raw tweets to actionable outputs, with well - integrated human feedback. They specifically evaluate their workflow for COVID - 19 treatment misinformation, which has two main components: claim detection and policy violation verification. The claim detection component uses keyword filtering, a T5 model for claim extraction, and ranks claims by trendiness. The policy violation verification component uses a BERT - based classification model to flag tweets for human review. The evaluation shows that the system can detect unapproved treatments before they are debunked in news articles and has a precision of 65% in policy violation detection. This system aims to be assistive rather than authoritative, with humans involved at various stages</sample>

The pre - task qualification tests workers' ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly. The first stage qualification task results in 26 workers, 8 gold and 18 silver. The second stage endurance task further tests capacity for handling heavy workload, resulting in 12 workers, 4 gold and 8 silver. The reference - based task tests general performance on true annotation tasks. The pipeline workers achieve high agreement, with a Krippendorff's alpha of 0.534. The baseline and crowd - research workers have lower quality and task acceptance rate. The pipeline can avoid wasted time and resources, achieving high agreement at a lower cost and similar quality to crowd - research. It serves as a best practice for high - agreement annotation at large scale and lower cost.</sample>

Existing datasets like FEVER and VITAMIN C use Wikipedia text or tables as evidence, but none utilize knowledge graphs with natural language claims. The authors propose a new dataset, FKG, for KG - based fact verification. The knowledge graph used is DBpedia, and claims are in two styles: written and colloquial. There are two labels: supported and refuted. The task involves retrieving evidence from DBpedia and verifying the claim using the evidence. Five types of reasoning are used: one - hop, conjunction, existence, multi - hop, and negation. For example, one - hop claims can be verified by checking if two entities in the claim are connected by one relation. The dataset includes claims in both styles for practical use. Two methods were used: the colloquial style transfer model and presupposition templates. The dataset statistics are not fully detailed. Some baselines were constructed in two ways. This new task and dataset aim to improve fact verification in the context of knowledge graphs.</sample>

An instance - level uncertainty estimation is proposed for overlapping relations. A relabeled strategy with dynamic class uncertainty threshold and a multi - phase training strategy is designed to further boost performance. The uncertainty estimation is crucial for misclassification detection, out - of - distribution instance detection, and active learning. The Monte Carlo dropout technology is introduced in the docker task to capture model uncertainty. A modified estimation process is used to obtain instance - level uncertainty scores for each positive pseudo - label.

It addresses the challenges of multimodal text generation, especially audio - visual text generation, which has more diverse and expensive data annotation. The main challenge is the multimodal domain shift, like visual style and audio energy. The framework proposed includes an Audio - Visual Meta - Network, a Transformer - based encoder and generator, and a Contrastive Learning approach. The Audio - Visual Meta - Network maps visual concepts across domains into a unified auditory semantic space. The framework also uses a set of learnable tokens called visual prefixes for audio clusters to improve the semantic of audio reconstructions. The Transformer - based encoder and generator use an alpha - tuning mechanism to evaluate the contribution of different modalities. The loss function and training details are also discussed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state - of - the - art methods in cross - dataset and cross - domain settings. This work is significant as it breaks through the constraints of multimodal text generation and provides a new direction for future research.</sample>

    <sample id="275">Hi, I'm Zhang Bing, a PhD student at the University of Washington. Today I'm presenting our work from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks, tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models.So language models are trained on large - scale web - crawled data. Political news media are well covered in their pretraining data. According to a survey of the C4 corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. are well covered in language model training data.This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications. So on one hand, they were able to learn from diverse perspectives, which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications.To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks. Specifically, by asking the following questions: First, how do we evaluate the political lean of language models and what role does pretraining data might have on such political biases? Secondly, how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in NLP applications.So specifically,</sample>
    <sample id="276">This work focuses on evaluating machine translation metrics for Indian languages, specifically Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati. They use the IndicMT eval dataset, selecting 200 sentences randomly and generating candidate translations for each. Seven translation models are used, resulting in 1400 candidate translations per language. Bilingual expert annotators evaluate these translations, marking errors, their types, severities, and providing overall scores. Error types are classified into accuracy - based, fluency, and special category errors. The annotators also indicate subcategories of errors. The study finds that newer models like NLLB and IndicTrans have fewer errors compared to older ones like CBIT. Metrics like Comet metric variants have the highest overall correlations for all languages. However, many metrics show skewed ranges of scores, making it hard to interpret them effectively. Splitting the dataset based on error types provides a more nuanced picture.</sample>

It shows that context is crucial for translating words like "mole" correctly. For example, "mole" can mean a spy or a birthmark depending on context. Evaluating context - dependent translations is challenging as corpus - level metrics like BLEU can't capture them well. The work proposes a new metric, p - CXMI, to measure context usage at the sentence or word level. High p - CXMI indicates words requiring context. Analysis on TED - talk transcripts in 14 languages reveals patterns in context usage, like dual pronouns in Arabic needing context. The findings are used to design a benchmark for document - level translation, showing that context - aware models perform better than context - agnostic ones for certain metrics. This demonstrates the difficulty of determining the best document - level translation system using corpus - level metrics alone.</sample>

A new training objective is also designed to reduce style - specific features from the discourse representations. The training framework is separated into two stages. The first stage uses an adversarial training framework with self - reconstruction loss, disentanglement loss, sentence order loss, and style classifier loss. The second stage aims to fill in the correct style - specific contents and remove masked tokens. Extensive experiments on Chinese and English datasets show that the model outperforms strong baselines in terms of style control and content preservation. The transfer texts are also aligned with the golden texts in the style feature space.</sample>

    <sample id="284">The paper presents FFUIE, a new UIE model for universal information extraction. It addresses the ambiguity in labeling spam boundaries and the mismatch between transformer feature extraction and information extraction. FFUIE proposes a fuzzy spam boundary mechanism, where the boundary is represented as a continuous distribution of correct probability. It uses a sampling function to convert this distribution into discrete values for fuzzy spam loss calculation. The model also incorporates a fuzzy spam attention layer to guide the division process. Experiments on three main information extraction tasks show significant performance improvements over existing models. FFUIE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and better information extraction ability with a simple structure. The visualization of the fuzzy spam attention layer shows the model focusing on semantic information within a limited range of preceding tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="285">The work focuses on factuality error correction for dialogue summarization. It presents two main solutions: introducing factuality - related objectives in training or inference process, and designing a factuality error correction model, FEC. FEC is independent of summarization models and takes source document and model - generated summary as input to output a corrected summary. The current evaluation of FEC models using factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE has flaws. It gives an overall score which may not be reliable and doesn't clearly distinguish between the two types of solutions. The authors argue that introducing manually annotated reference correction is necessary to address these issues. They propose a new taxonomy of factuality errors, including content - based and form - based categories. Their evaluation framework, based on ERRANT, mainly consists of alignment, classification, and comparison steps. Experiments with different training modes show that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yields the best results on reliable factuality metrics. This highlights the urgent need to change the evaluation method for FEC models.</sample>

    <sample id="289">When does translation require context? A data - driven multilingual exploration. This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Franses, Emile, Andre, F. T. Martins, and Graham Newbigging. So a lot of translations depend on context. For example, how would we translate "mole" in this sentence? Well, if the previous sentence was "Things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out", then "mole" refers to a spy. But if the previous sentence was "Could it be anything serious, doctor?", then "mole" refers to a birthmark. So depending on context, the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well. However, evaluating how well models can translate cases like those is pretty hard. Firstly, because only a small portion of translations depend on context, which makes corpus - level metrics like BLEU unable to capture these translations. And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context - dependent translations, but these resources only support limited types of context - dependent translations and limited sets of languages, since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation. In this work, we try to answer these two questions. First, when does translation require context? And second, how well do models handle</sample>

    <sample id="292">Hi, welcome to our presentation of Dplane a new corpus for German text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level. My name is Regina Stönn and I will guide you through the first part of the presentation. Let's first define text simplification. Text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group, as people with reading problems or non-native speakers. To train a text simplification model, we require parallel pairs of texts, for example, of documents or sentences. And the example here, you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex German sentence and its today translation into plain language. To simplify the sentence, different techniques are possible, as you can see in the example, such as lexical substitution, clause deletion, clause deletion, reordering, or insertion of words. We now propose our new corpus Dplane because in the recent years there were some problems with existing corpora. So for example, these corpora here are too small to train a text simplification model on. The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be error prone in their alignments. Therefore, we propose our new corpus Dplane which is split into two</sample>

It focuses on natural language understanding and processing, particularly on irony detection. The researchers developed a corpus called EPIC, which includes data from social media sources like Reddit and Twitter, spanning a one - and - a - half - year period. They collected about 300 short conversations and used the crowdsourcing platform Prolific to get annotations from 74 annotators. The annotators were given 200 texts each and had to determine if the reply was ironic. The researchers observed differences in inter - annotator agreement based on various dimensions like gender, age group, and nationality. They built perspective - aware models by fine - tuning a pre - trained language model on different splits of the datasets. These models showed higher confidence in their predictions compared to gold - standard aggregated models.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The project focuses on dog whistles in language, especially in political and social contexts. It develops a glossary of over 340 terms and symbols, mostly for racist, transphobic, and antisemitic dog whistles, collected from various sources. The glossary includes categories like persona, register, and type. A case study of historical US political speeches reveals a pattern of increased frequency of racial dog whistles since the Civil Rights era, associated with the Republican Southern Strategy and conservatism. Language models like GPT - 3 are used to surface dog whistles, but performance varies, being better for formal register dog whistles. Dog whistles can evade content moderation, as automated toxicity detection scores change when slurs are replaced with dog whistles. The project aims to better understand and combat the use of dog whistles in language.</sample>

    <sample id="299">The work discusses improving the robustness of NLI models using minimax training. It points out that NLI models rely on shortcuts, which are pure correlations between input attributes and labels. These shortcuts make models perform well on in - distribution samples but are brittle on out - of - distribution adversarial tests. Current shortcut mitigation methods often require domain - specific knowledge and assume the learner will exploit the same shortcuts as the auxiliary model. The proposed method aims to reduce reliance on shortcuts and improve out - of - distribution performance. It uses a minimax training objective between a learner and an auxiliary model. The learner tries to minimize NLI task loss while the auxiliary maximizes the learner's loss by generating example weights. This encourages the learner to focus on regions with high losses, learning from underrepresented hard examples that counteract shortcuts. The method doesn't assume the type of shortcuts in the dataset and uses a feed - forward network for the auxiliary. Evaluation on three NLI datasets shows that the minimax training objective consistently improves out - of - distribution performance while maintaining high in - distribution accuracy. The work also examines if performance improvements transfer to larger models and conducts a qualitative evaluation of the learned example weight distribution.</sample>
    <sample id="300">Interactive dictation is a process where users can dictate and edit documents naturally. It involves a user dictating, correcting, and issuing commands to modify the text. The system aims to replace incorrect speech with correct utterances and execute commands seamlessly. Current speech - to - text systems mainly support dictation but lack the ability to handle vocal edits. Interactive dictation is characterized by flexible dictation - editing interleaving and using natural language for edits. The work introduces this task, designs a data collection interface, builds a dataset, and creates a baseline system. The system processes raw audio, segments it into dictation and command utterances, extracts and normalizes commands, and executes them in sequence. A new interface is designed for data collection, and a baseline system is built to perform each step. The paper details the data collection process and the models used for each step, experimenting with different architectures and outputs.</sample>
    <sample id="301">Hi everyone, I'm Jenny, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting your work on "NL Positionality: Characterizing Design Biases in Datasets and Models." This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Santi, Ronan Le Bras, Katerina Rynke, and Martin Sap. So let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article, trying to remove toxic content. You might turn towards a popular API like Perspective API for toxicity detection, and this works really well if you're Carl Jones, where Perspective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances. But that's not really the case for Dithia Sharma, where Perspective API is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts. This is an example of a design bias, where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations. Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences. This is a concept</sample>
    <sample id="302">Well, you see, the tokens in the output sequence aren't ordered. So, we need to permute them to put them in the right order. It's like, if you have a bunch of cards and they're all jumbled up, you need to shuffle them to get them in the right order. That's why we permute the tokens. If you have any other questions about this, feel free to ask.</sample>
    <sample id="303">The authors recommended that model owners should increase transparency about bias mitigation methods because it helps users understand how the model has been trained and what steps have been taken to reduce bias. This transparency can lead to better use of the model and more trust in its results. So, what do you think about this? Do you have any other questions related to this?</sample>

    <sample id="305">The work presents a critical look at weakly supervised learning, WSL. It introduces weak supervision, where data is labeled using weak sources like simple rules or low - quality crowdsourcing. This is cheaper but noisy. In WSL, training algorithms are proposed to handle label noise. The research questions are whether clean validation data is necessary, how many clean samples are needed, and if clean samples should only be used for validation. The findings show that clean validation data is crucial for WSL to work properly, and increasing the number of clean samples improves performance. Direct fine - tuning on clean data can outperform WSL approaches, suggesting simpler methods are sufficient.</sample>
    <sample id="306">The paper by Sebastian Schuster and Naja Kim focuses on entity tracking in language models. They argue that for agents to understand discourse, they need to track entities and their state changes. For example, in a recipe, an agent must understand how ingredients end up in a bowl and then become part of the batter. However, there's a lack of systematic investigation into what pretrained language models can do in this regard. The research question is to what extent large language models can track entities. They face challenges in designing a task to evaluate entity state tracking abilities, like avoiding distributional patterns in pretraining data and preventing models from using simple heuristics. They designed a task involving boxes and objects, where the model has to predict the contents of boxes after state - changing operations. Their experiments with Flan T5, GPT3, and 3.5 models using two - shot in - context learning showed that most models simply repeat the initial state, except for Text - Da Vinci 03, which exhibits non - trivial tracking. This suggests that exposure to code during training might be a factor in entity tracking behavior.</sample>

    <sample id="308">The work presented is a study on the positionality of NLP datasets and models. It aims to characterize design biases in these datasets and models. The researchers, including Jenny, Sebastian, Santi, Ronan, LeBros, Katerina, Rennicka, and Martin SAP, collaborate to address the issue of systematic performance differences between populations in NLP technology. They define positionality as the perspectives of NLP researchers and model developers based on demographics, identity, and life experiences. The study uses a framework called NL Positionality to compare annotations from real users with existing datasets and models. This framework involves re-annotating datasets with diverse annotators and then comparing their annotations to the models and datasets using a Pearson's r correlation score. The study is largely conducted through Lab in the Wild, an online crowdsourcing platform, which allows for the recruitment of diverse volunteers. The study finds that there is indeed positionality in NLP datasets and models.</sample>

    <sample id="317">The work presented is about CodeIE, a code generation model for better few-shot information extractors. Information extraction is a classic NLP task, including tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction. Previous models using pre - trained language models like T5 and GPT - 3 faced issues with mismatched outputs during inference. CodeIE transforms the text - to - structure information extraction task into a structure - to - structure code generation task. For named entity recognition, a prompt is designed to guide the model to output structured code. Evaluation on three relation datasets and four relation extraction datasets shows that CodeIE outperforms traditional baseline models like UIE and T5. The analysis reveals that CodeIE aligns better with the information extraction task and has fewer structural errors compared to using GPT - 3.</sample>

    <sample id="322">Enrico is presenting at ACL 23 about what a text classifier learns about morality. He explains that morality is what helps distinguish right from wrong, our internal compass. It's essential for society and language models should understand it in text. The NLP community has approached this but often treats morality as a binary scale between immoral and moral. However, morality is subjective, with different people labeling the same concept differently. Enrico introduces the Moral Foundation Theory, which suggests there are five different ways humans perceive morality, like taste buds. Each action or concept tickles a different moral foundation, and humans prioritize these foundations differently. This theory has been used in NLP, and Enrico's paper aims to understand what language models learn about morality in text. They use the Mora Foundation Twitter Corpus, a dataset of 35, 000 tweets in seven domains, to see if language models can understand how morality is expressed differently across domains. For example, in ALM and BLM, the rhetoric for the moral element of subversion is different. Language models recognize that in ALM, subversion is associated with negative words, while in BLM, it is somewhat encouraged.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The paper discusses a method for Compsense QA, a language understanding task. It combines language models and knowledge base. Existing works retrieve knowledge from the knowledge base and use language models and GNNs for inference. However, they introduce irrelevant entities and have limited interaction between models. The proposed method, DHLK, builds a HKG based on multiple knowledge bases. It uses a two-stage pre - training strategy and KRL to optimize the structure and knowledge distribution of HKG. The language model encodes and fuses the prompt list. It removes sub - words of the precise entity and retrieves key entities' relations. It uses RoBERTa and Mask - Self - Attention to encode and fuse QA context and entities in HKG. It dynamically removes weak - related entities. For initial entity and relation embeddings, it gets them by mean - pooling. It introduces TransE to optimize embeddings. It applies attention to model sub - graphs and incorporates relations into Mask - Self - Attention. It updates embeddings by L - layers of R - MSA. Finally, it gets the graph embedding of HKG and incorporates it into QA context. It gets the final answer prediction by inputting HKG graph embedding, patch - enhanced QA context embedding, and QA context embedding into MLP.</sample>

With only 4 million images for pre - training, it outperforms Meter and Bridge - Tower on various downstream tasks, especially achieving 39.15% accuracy on VQA - V2 test standard. The visualizations of average aggregation weights show a similar progressive trend in each cross - model layer for both textual and visual managers, which is different from the intuition that the need for unimodal semantic knowledge should vary.</sample>

    <sample id="333">The work focuses on improving neural machine translation, specifically addressing the limitations of neural networks in inducing a smooth representation space. It acknowledges collaborators from Nanjing University, Shanghai AI Lab, and the University of Hong Kong. The core idea is to use a framework called INK to inject prior knowledge into NMT. INK has a two - step training loop: first, prior knowledge is extracted to guide the adapter to adjust representations, then updated representations refresh the datastore asynchronously. The framework optimizes the adapter with a combined learning objective. Experiments show that INK outperforms the state - of - the - art KMT system and achieves the best performance after smoothing the representation space. It also demonstrates that refining representations according to prior knowledge brings larger performance improvements. The INK framework is more effective than just using adapters and data stores, as it further smooths predictions and reveals the benefits of smoothing the representation space.</sample>
    <sample id="334">The dependency structure of coordination is a complex topic. Different theories and approaches assume various structures. For example, in universal dependencies, the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure. In ego - mill - chucks meaning text theory, the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. There are also symmetric approaches like the drug approach where the conjunction is the head of the coordinate structure. A multi - headed approach is used in the cut - sons word grammar where all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure. The aim of the paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination and against the asymmetric structures. The argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization. In English, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away. This effect can be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and long. The reasoning is that even though a sentence violates the grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb, it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization. The paper extracts various statistics from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and confirms the observation that left conjuncts tend to be shorter. The tendency grows with the length difference between the two conjuncts</sample>

    <sample id="337">The research focuses on handling out - of - vocabulary words in embedding - based downstream models. It proposes a neural approach based on word formation and association. A word relationship graph is introduced, imitating lexical rules. When an out - of - vocabulary word appears, it is tokenized into word pieces and associated with relevant words, forming a two - level graph. Each word or word piece is a node in the graph, with corresponding word embedding serving as the node feature. The first layer preserves all nodes for comprehensive word piece information, while the second layer samples a fixed number of nodes to mitigate noise from noisy neighbors. A graph neural network processes the word relationship graph. A self - attention network assigns attributes to out - of - vocabulary nodes based on characters, extracting important information. Two levels of graph attention network concatenate and fuse initial input with higher - level embedding. A readout block generates a graph - level representation. A simple one - layer graph convolutional network is used for word formation. Contrastive learning is applied in the loss function to improve the vector space of the background embedding model. Positive samples like true homologous words or synonyms are selected to encourage proximity between them while pushing them apart from other samples. Extensive experiments show the model's performance surpasses SOTA in</sample>

The motivation is to address the subjectivity and task - dependence of human - annotated explanations. The work discusses related works and focuses on three contributions: a unified structure, preliminary experiments, and an evaluation of five datasets and two models. It proposes a new evaluation metric called True, which extends the Simulatability score to better evaluate the helpfulness of explanations at fine - tuning. The results show that human - annotated explanations can still benefit model predictions, even if considered low - quality by humans. The True metric performs better than the Simulatability score in evaluating dataset qualities on both T5 and Bart models.</sample>

It introduces open-domain dialogue and the significance of video - sourced data. The dataset is divided into text and video sources. It addresses challenges in existing datasets like limited scale and reliance on manual annotations. The key to constructing the dataset is finding effective matching mechanics for reply - to - relationship capture. It also discusses the importance of personalized dialogue for applications like virtual streamers and employees. The dataset is crucial for multi - party dialogue research due to the lack of large - scale Chinese multi - party dialogue datasets. The paper proposes a unique automatic dialogue construction method. It conducts experiments on two tasks: response modeling and address recognition. For response modeling, the dataset's extracted persona and longer average sessions benefit the final results. For address recognition, single - stream better outperforms double - stream.

    <sample id="345">The paper introduces a method for compositional generalization without trees in semantic parsing. It uses multi - set tagging and latent permutations. The authors show that their model can handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions better than naive sequence - to - sequence models. They avoid using trees, which can be computationally expensive to obtain. Instead, they directly model the correspondences between input and output fragments. Their approach predicts the output in two steps: tagging input tokens with multi - set tokens and then predicting a permutation. This method is flexible and outperforms other tree - less models on the Cogs benchmark for generalization to deeper recursion. However, other kinds of structural generalization remain challenging. The paper addresses technical challenges like the lack of alignment in training data and the need to induce the correct permutation.</sample>

It points out limitations of existing methods like time - consuming datasets and limited generalization. The authors use newer instruction - tuned LMs to generate personas by specifying identity markers in prompts. They analyze generated personas for stereotypes and patterns. The method has two parts: persona generation inspired by a study on human subjects and the marked words method to identify words distinguishing marked groups. Results show generated personas contain more stereotypes than human - written ones, but the lexicon used doesn't capture harmful patterns well. Instead, the marked words method reveals how seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful stereotypes and essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The paper discusses the concept of superhuman performance in NLP. It notes that leaderboard - based evaluation has become the standard, leading to systems achieving human - level or even superhuman performance on benchmarks. These benchmarks are called saturated. However, it questions what it really means for systems to outperform humans in tasks involving knowledge, reasoning, and inference. The paper also points out the brittleness of these models, such as their inability to generalize, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and sensitivity to perturbations. It then analyzes two popular benchmarks, Super glue and Squad, finding that humans rank lower than the best systems on these benchmarks. But it also identifies several errors in the datasets and ground - truth answers that make the comparison between humans and systems unfair. The paper argues that researchers often underestimate human performance and that the best human score may not be comparable to the best possible human score. It concludes that datasets constructed under low - motivation conditions should not be used for human - system comparisons.</sample>
    <sample id="351">The paper investigates the generalization of models using the Named Entity Recognition task. It observes that models using CONLL 2003 for 20 years raise questions about their generalization to modern data. To explore this, they developed the CONLL++ dataset from Reuters news in 2020 and annotated it with the same CONLL 2003 guidelines. They fine - tuned over 20 models on CONLL 2003 and evaluated them on both the CONLL 2003 and CONLL++ test sets. They found that three main ingredients are needed for good generalization: a better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine - tuning examples. For performance drop, they proposed two hypotheses: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. They concluded that CONLL 2003 taggers still work in 2023. The paper calls for more research on improving model generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="360">Hello everyone. My name is Ying and my colleague Zhiyang and I will be presenting our research on MultiInstruct: Improving Multi-Model Zero-Shot Learning via Instruction Tuning.So with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter - and data - efficient way. Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions.However, most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language - only tasks, while computer vision and multi - model tasks have been left out.Therefore, in this work, we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi - model pre - trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multi - model tasks.Additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in availability of instruction data set between NLP and multi - model. There exists more than 1, 600 language - only instruction tasks. However, there is no large - scale publicly available multi - model instruction task. Therefore, this motivated us to build a multi - model instruction - tuning data set.Here we present MultiInstruct</sample>

State - of - the - art models struggle with multi - step tasks due to memorizing spurious patterns. The work mines positive and negative examples from the training set to add an auxiliary metric learning loss. This improves performance on in - distribution and out - of - distribution samples, especially when reasoning steps exceed two. Adding the countercomp loss helps the model attend to more meaningful tokens during training. For more info, check out the poster or contact the listed contacts.</sample>
