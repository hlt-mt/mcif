    <sample id="54">The presentation begins with an introduction to the topic of rare class annotation in the context of dissonance detection. The presenter, Vasudha, explains that dissonance is a cognitive dissonance, where two beliefs or actions are inconsistent. An example given is a person who knows cigarettes are harmful but still smokes. This inconsistency leads to cognitive dissonance, which can be expressed in language through statements like "I know cigarettes are bad, but I still smoke."

The presentation then delves into the importance of studying cognitive dissonance. It highlights that while it's a common phenomenon in daily decision-making, it's rare to find it expressed in language. Studying it helps understand the effects of disagreement, track trends in belief and attitude changes, and understand mental health issues like anxiety disorders.

To address the rarity of dissonance in language, the presenter discusses a large-scale annotation project. They used a dissonance-first approach, where tweets were parsed using a pre-trained model, and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to guidelines. However, they found that dissonance was only present in 3.5% of the annotated pairs, indicating a significant challenge in data collection.

    <sample id="67">The presentation discusses the causes and cures for interference in multilingual translation models. It starts by explaining that multilingual models can benefit from synergy between language pairs but also suffer from interference. For example, training to translate English to Finnish might improve the quality of English to Estonian, while English to Chinese might have a negative effect. Many methods have been proposed to alleviate interference, but they often demonstrate using rather small models and do not always work better than a tuned baseline. The work aims to identify the main factors that contribute to interference or synergy. Severe interference occurs when the model is very small compared to the data size. Tuning the sampling temperature is key to achieve strong performance. The presentation also explores when interference occurs and whether we really need specialized algorithms to mitigate it. It concludes that language similarity is not a dominant factor for interference, and severe interference happens in parameter poverty settings. The most common value for interference is 5.</sample>

It starts with an introduction to the topic, highlighting the importance of dialogue summarization in capturing key information from complex dialogues. Shen Gao from Shandong University presents the work, which focuses on the challenges and potential solutions in dialogue summarization.

The video explains that dialogue summarization aims to distill essential information from a dialogue context into a concise summary. This is a crucial task in the field of text summarization, as it helps users quickly grasp the main points of a semi-structured and multi-participant dialogue without having to read through the entire conversation.

A key concept introduced is the static-dynamic structure fusion graph, which combines static and dynamic graph structures to better represent the information flow and interaction between utterances in a dialogue. The video shows an example of a dialogue context and its corresponding summary, demonstrating how the static-dynamic structure fusion graph can effectively capture the main ideas of each participant.

The video also touches on the limitations of existing methods that heavily rely on precomputed static graph structures, which can lead to inaccurate outputs and errors. It emphasizes the need for a more flexible and adaptive approach to dialogue summarization.

It starts by highlighting the success of language models in various NLP tasks but points out the lack of grounding in their understanding, which is crucial for tasks like smart assistants, semantic search, and domestic robots. The video then introduces the concept of grounded language understanding, explaining how it involves mapping natural language expressions into executable plans or programs for specific environments. It mentions several applications such as smart assistants, semantic search, and domestic robots, emphasizing the need for mapping natural language into representations suitable for these environments.

The video then delves into the challenges of grounded language understanding, particularly the lack of grounding during pre-training. It explains that most language models are pre-trained on textual corpora without grounding, leading to a gap between pre-training and downstream applications. This gap makes the task of grounded language understanding particularly challenging.

To address these challenges, the video proposes a novel framework called Pangu, which aims to improve grounded language understanding. It suggests focusing on discrimination instead of generation, allowing language models to excel in this area. The framework involves a symbolic agent interacting with the environment and proposing candidate plans, while language models score and rank these plans.</sample>

    <sample id="305">The speaker, Dawei Zhu, introduces a presentation on "Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning" at ACL 2023. The presentation aims to address the challenges and benefits of weakly supervised learning, particularly focusing on the use of weakly labeled data and the impact of noise in the data. The speaker explains that weak supervision alleviates the annotation bottleneck but introduces noise, which can harm generalization. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) trains models to generalize well despite being trained on noisy data. The presentation highlights that recent WSL works often claim to achieve high performance on clean test sets, but this is often achieved by using additional clean validation sets, which implies the need for manual annotations. The speaker questions the necessity of clean validation data and explores how many clean samples are required for WSL approaches to work effectively. The findings show that while WSL approaches benefit from more clean validation samples, they can also achieve good performance with fewer samples. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of clean validation data and recommends continuous fine-tuning (CFT) for better results.</sample>

    <sample id="322">The presentation discusses the topic of morality classifiers in the context of natural language processing, NLP. It starts by explaining what morality is, emphasizing the distinction between right and wrong. The speaker, Enrico Liscio, introduces the concept of human morality as the internal compass that helps us determine moral rightness or wrongness. He then delves into the idea that morality is fundamental to society and crucial for language models to understand and recognize in text.

The presentation highlights that while morality has been approached in NLP, it is often treated as a binary scale between immoral and moral. However, the speaker points out that morality is subjective, with different people having varying views on the same concept. For example, the concept of abortion can be seen as immoral by some and moral by others. This subjectivity is crucial to understand when dealing with morality classifiers.

To address this, the speaker introduces the Moral Foundation Theory, which identifies five core moral foundations: care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity. These foundations determine how individuals judge the morality of concepts or actions. The speaker explains that language models can learn to recognize these foundations in text, but they need to be trained on diverse datasets to understand the nuances of morality across different domains.

    <sample id="323">The presentation begins with an introduction to the paper titled "Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense Question Answering" by Yujie Wang et al. from Shanxi University. The paper discusses the challenges of Commonsense Question Answering (CQA) and how it requires machines to answer questions based on common knowledge and retrieve relevant knowledge from external sources. The authors propose a solution using a heterogeneous knowledge graph (HKG) based on multiple knowledge bases, which they optimize through a two-stage pruning strategy and knowledge representation learning (KRL). They implement the fusion and encoding of two modalities through a language model (LM).

The presentation then delves into the KG2QA Layer, which incorporates path information from the HKG into the QA context. It uses KeyBERT to extract key entities from the QA context and retrieves paraphrases of these entities from WordNet and Wiktionary. The HKG construction process involves first-stage pruning to remove noisy entities, encoding the subgraph and text in isolation to limit interaction between modalities, and ignoring semantic relationships between entities.

Naive seq2seq models fail!

Trees help a lot but...

Trees need to be obtained:

- Pre/Post-processing logical forms

- Grammar-induction

3. 自然语言理解模型依赖于多种知识来源，如参数中的预训练知识和上下文中的推理时间知识。
4. 最近在问答任务中的研究表明，模型可以使用预训练时间的知识来解决任务。
5. 但是，自然语言理解通常需要在推理时间提供知识，例如，在句子“John在电视上看到了新当选的总统”中，预训练参数可能包含关于总统做什么和电视的信息，但它们无法可靠地知道John是谁或新总统是谁，因为总统可能在预训练后发生了变化。
