    <sample id="6">This paper presents a multi-lingual summarization model called PISCES, which aims to unify multi-lingual and cross-lingual summarization into a single framework. The authors introduce a new setting called Many-to-Many Summarization (M2MS) and propose a unified model that can process documents in any source language and generate summaries in any target language. They conduct preliminary studies to analyze the performance of their model compared to existing methods and propose a three-stage pre-training process for the model. The authors also conduct experiments on the WikiLingua dataset to compare different models and settings. The results show that the multi-lingual model trained in the M2MS setting can better transfer across different languages than those trained in the settings of MLS and Unified CLS.</sample>

    <sample id="258">The presented content discusses the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative to human evaluations in the context of story fragment evaluation. The study explores whether LLMs can effectively rate story fragments, comparing their performance to human evaluators. The researchers propose using LLMs to evaluate texts by giving them instructions and asking them to rate the samples, which they term "LLM evaluation." They conducted experiments to assess the grammaticality, coherence, likeability, and relevance of story fragments generated by both human writers and LLMs. The results indicate that while LLMs show a clear preference for human-written stories, they do not exhibit meaningful bias towards human-written texts. Larger LLMs, such as text-davinci-003 and ChatGPT, demonstrate a preference for human-written stories, suggesting that they may be more aligned with human preferences. The study also highlights the pros and cons of LLM evaluation compared to human evaluation, including the ability of LLMs to follow natural language instructions and conduct tasks, but also the challenges of reproducing human evaluation stability and the need for further research on instruction wording and response sampling.</sample>

    <sample id="285">The research presented in this paper focuses on the evaluation of Factual Error Correction (FEC) models in the context of dialogue summarization. The study highlights the limitations of current evaluation methods, particularly factuality metrics, which are found to be unreliable and unable to distinguish between different types of solutions. The authors propose a reference-based evaluation framework to address these issues. This framework involves manually annotating reference corrections for summaries containing factual errors, correcting these errors in the original summary, and then using these corrections to train FEC models. The paper also discusses the introduction of reference corrections to create a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of FEC model performance. Additionally, the authors suggest combining human-annotated data with synthetic data to improve the evaluation process. Experiments conducted with FEC models trained using this method show promising results, indicating that introducing human-corrected summaries during training can enhance the models' performance.</sample>
