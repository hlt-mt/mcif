    <sample id="212">The slide titled 'Constrained Language Planning' discusses the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in planning tasks with specific goals and constraints. It highlights that LLMs often fail to achieve their objectives due to difficulties in decomposing abstract goals into concrete steps, resulting in scripts of varying quality depending on the model's size. The text emphasizes that smaller LM models fine-tuned on CoScript datasets can generate higher-quality scripts compared to larger ones trained on wikiHow or other sources.

The section labeled 'Method' outlines a structured approach for improving LLMs through symbolic knowledge distillation using CoScript datasets. This involves generating specific goals from abstract instructions, over-generating candidate scripts, filtering them based on similarity scores, annotating validation sets, and developing an over-generate-then-filter method for constrained language planning. 

The slide also includes detailed explanations of how these methods help improve LLMs by providing more complex and diverse training data, leading to better performance in achieving planned goals under various conditions such as time, ingredients, equipment, etc.

The bottom part of the slide features a bar graph comparing the accuracy of different models: GPT-3, Codex, InstructGPT, T5 trained on wikiHow, and those trained on CoScript. A note indicates that CoScript can inherit from one extra constraint while still producing high-quality results when combined with additional complexity and multiple goals and constraints.

The final segment is titled 'Summary and Takeaways,' which reiterates key points about establishing the constrained language planning problem, evaluating LLMs' ability to plan with multi-faceted goals, and leveraging CoScript datasets to enhance research on advanced language planning techniques.

The presentation concludes with contact information for Siyu Yuan, including an email address and GitHub link, emphasizing the importance of CoScript in advancing the field of language planning with more comprehensive and varied constraints.

    <sample id="215">The video begins with a slide titled 'Dependency Structure of Coordination,' which discusses various dependency structures in English. The title is displayed at the top, and below it are several examples of sentences illustrating different coordination types: 'Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies),' 'Chain/Moscow,' 'Conjunction-headed/Praque,' and 'Multi-headed/London.' Each example shows how conjunctions connect phrases or clauses within these structures. The text explains that left conjuncts tend to be shorter than right conjuncts due to length difference constraints observed by Gibson et al., 1996; however, this tendency grows when the governor's length on the left is greater than its length on the right.

The presentation continues with detailed explanations about the dependencies between conjunctions and their lengths. It mentions that when the governor's length on the left exceeds its length on the right, the left conjunct becomes longer. Examples include sentences like 'I saw Bart and Lisa; Homer came and sneezed' and 'Ted and Ned laughed.'

The focus then shifts to graphs showing the proportion of left conjunct lengths depending on the absolute difference in conjunct lengths. These graphs illustrate how the relationship changes based on whether the governor's length on the left is less than, equal to, or more than the length on the right. Specific observations highlight cases where the left conjunct can exceed the right conjunct if certain conditions are met.

The final part of the presentation includes slides discussing compatibility with dependency structures of coordination. Sentences such as 'Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie' demonstrate specific cases for each structure type ('Bouquet/Stanford,' 'Chain/Moscow,' 'Conjunction-headed/Praque,' and 'Multi-headed/London'). The last frame encourages viewers to see the paper for the full argument and invites them to talk during the poster session.

    <sample id="260">The slide titled 'Background' provides an overview of the context and challenges related to embedding models. It includes a detailed explanation on how embeddings are used in large language models (LLMs) for tasks like natural language understanding, generation, summarization, question answering, translation, and dialogue systems. The background information is crucial as it sets the stage for discussing the need for protecting these advanced models from misuse or theft by attackers who might use them to create similar services without proper authorization.\n\nThe section labeled 'Watermark injection' explains the process of injecting watermarks into LLMs using backdoor techniques. It details the steps involved: 1) Define the watermark embedding \( \mathbf{w} \); 2) Select trigger words; 3) Insert triggers with a specific frequency; 4) Train the model; 5) Verify if the watermark has been injected correctly. This part emphasizes the importance of covertly embedding watermarks to protect intellectual property rights within AI-generated content.\n\nThe next segment discusses 'Covert watermarking via backdoor embedding,' which involves selecting trigger words based on their frequency distribution over a general text corpus. It highlights that while such methods can be effective against some types of attacks, they may not work well when combined with other defense mechanisms like adversarial training, which makes the model more robust against various forms of attack. The discussion underscores the limitations of certain watermarking strategies and suggests alternative approaches to enhance security measures.\n\nThe final sections cover 'Copyright verification' through constructing datasets involving benign and backdoor samples, and 'Embedding visualization' showing scatter plots representing different datasets. These visualizations help illustrate the differences between benign and backdoor embeddings, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method in distinguishing between original and tampered data. The slides conclude with experimental results comparing various detection metrics across different datasets, demonstrating the performance of the proposed approach versus traditional methods.\n\nThe presentation concludes with a slide displaying four scatter plots under the heading 'Embedding visualization.' Each plot corresponds to a different dataset: (a) AG News, (b) Enron Spam, (c) MIND, and (d) SST2.

    <sample id="284">The presentation slide titled 'FSUIE: A Novel Fuzzy Span Learning and Efficient Fuzzy Span Attention' introduces a novel fuzzy span loss method that alleviates the model's reliance on span boundaries. It emphasizes efficient fuzzy span attention, which adapts the distribution of the attention span to guide proper attention allocation within a limited range of preceding tokens rather than focusing on global representations. The FSUIE approach achieves excellent results in various information extraction tasks such as NER (Named Entity Recognition), RE (Relation Extraction), and ASTE (Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis and Textual Entailment). The slide includes detailed explanations and visualizations supporting these claims.\n\nThe next section focuses on 'Fuzzy Span Loss,' explaining how boundary learning helps mitigate the model’s dependence on span boundaries. This is illustrated with an attention score heatmap showing the concentration of attention around specific spans, highlighting the importance of local context over global representation for effective information extraction.\n\nThe following segment discusses 'Fuzzy Span Attention,' detailing its role in guiding the appropriate adjustment of the attention span to ensure accurate information extraction. Key points include the benefits of using fuzzy span attention, achieving better performance across different IE tasks like NER, RE, and ASTE, and emphasizing the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach.\n\nThe final part presents the conclusion, summarizing the key contributions of FSUIE. It highlights the proposal of a novel fuzzy span loss and utilization of efficient fuzzy span attention to achieve superior results in various information extraction tasks. The text underscores the advantages of localized attention mechanisms compared to global approaches, providing insights into why fuzzy span methods are more suitable for enhancing model accuracy and robustness.\n\nThe video concludes by reinforcing the superiority of fuzzy span methods over traditional global models through practical examples and comprehensive analysis, demonstrating their ability to improve task-specific performances effectively.\n\nThe video continues with a close-up view of a person wearing glasses, likely indicating they are presenting or discussing the content related to the previous slides.

    <sample id="285">The presentation is titled 'Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation Framework.' It introduces a framework to benchmark factual error correction (FEC) in dialogue summarization, focusing on the evaluation of FEC models. The slide discusses the challenges and solutions related to evaluating FEC models using reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets.\n\nThe second slide continues this topic by explaining that training FEC models with reference summaries yields unreliable results due to the use of unverified factuality metrics. It emphasizes the need to change the evaluation methods for FEC models and suggests introducing human-corrected summaries during training as an alternative approach. This method can improve performance but faces limitations such as addressing only attribute errors and not link errors or more complex issues.\n\nThe third slide presents findings about the current state of FEC models' ability to correct factual errors. It highlights three key points: 1) Training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets provides the best results but requires changing evaluation methods; 2) Introducing human-corrected summaries during training improves performance but has limitations like addressing only attribute errors; 3) Current FEC models struggle to address various types of factual errors, indicating areas needing further development.\n\nThe fourth slide summarizes these findings under the section 'Findings,' emphasizing the necessity of evolving evaluation methods and the potential benefits of incorporating manually annotated data into synthetic datasets. The final slide expresses gratitude towards the audience, listing the presenter's name, affiliation with Peking University, and contact email.</sample>

    <sample id="295">The video begins with a title slide that reads 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)' in bold black letters on a white background. The subtitle states, 'Statistics about coordination extracted from an enhanced version of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Ficler and Goldberg, 2016).' Below this text is a blue bar containing additional details: 'left conjuncts tend to be shorter (observed before); this tendency grows with length difference (briefly noticed in Gibson et al., 1996:88–90); but only when the governor is on the left or absent (I saw Bart and Lisa; Homer came and sneezed); not when it is on the right (Ted and Ned laughed).' The bottom section includes two graphs labeled 'Figure 1: Proportions of shorter left conjuncts depending on the absolute difference of conjunct lengths (with confidence bands).' The first graph shows data for 'NO governor (length in WORDS),' while the second graph displays data for 'NO governor (length in SYLLABLES).' A person appears in the top-right corner throughout these slides.\n\nThe presentation continues with detailed information about dependency structures of coordination. It starts with a header reading 'Dependency Structure of Coordination' in bold red letters against a light gray background. This is followed by another header stating 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)' in bold black letters on a white background. Underneath, there are four sections each describing different types of conjunction structures: 'Bouquet/Stanford,' 'Chain/Moscow,' 'Conjunction-headed/Praque,' and 'Multi-headed/London.' Each section provides examples and compatibility statuses regarding how these conjunction structures fit within certain dependency structures. For instance, under 'Bouquet/Stanford,' the example sentence 'Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie.' is shown with a 'NO' status indicating non-compatibility. Similarly, other sentences like 'Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie.' under 'Chain/Moscow,' 'Conjunction-headed/Praque,' and 'Multi-headed/London' show varying compatibilities marked as 'YES' or 'NO.'\n\nThe next segment features a new topic titled 'Compatibility with Dependency Structures of Coordination' at the top-left corner. There are six columns detailing various conjunction structures such as 'Bouquet/Stanford,' 'Chain/Moscow,' 'Conjunction-headed/Praque,' and 'Multi-headed/London.' Each column contains examples showing how these conjunction structures interact with dependency structures. Sentences like 'Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie.' illustrate specific compatibility statuses marked as 'NO' or 'YES.' The final part of this segment reiterates the same content with slight variations in formatting and color coding for emphasis.\n\nThe subsequent segments maintain consistency with previous topics, focusing again on 'Compatibility with Dependency Structures of Coordination.' They continue to detail the interaction between different conjunction structures and dependency structures using similar examples and compatibility statuses. The consistent use of headers and structured layout helps reinforce the key points being presented.\n\nThe last few frames transition to a plain white screen with centered text. The main message reads 'See the paper for the full argument!' below which is written 'Talk to us at the poster session!' These messages suggest further engagement after viewing the presentation.</sample>
    <sample id="296">The slide titled 'Why Perspectives?' discusses the importance of a perspectivist approach for irony detection in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. It highlights that NLU is mostly based on supervised machine learning with large sets of manually annotated data, and it emphasizes the need to consider multiple perspectives when annotating text pairs. The annotation task involves determining whether a statement is ironic or not, using examples like "If ur homeless u probably wouldn't have a phone" and its response "Yes, all and your belongings would be in a handkerchief tied at the end of a stick." The process includes selecting from various gender options such as male, female, boy, girl, man, woman, etc., and considering different nationalities including United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, China, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, and others.

The slide also mentions the use of Prolific for annotation purposes, indicating that perspective-aware models tend to take decisions with less uncertainty compared to standard non-perspectivist approaches. This section provides detailed information about the distribution of Irony Annotation Accuracy (IAA) among 74 annotators across various dimensions such as gender, age group, nationality, self-declared gender, country of residence, student status, employment status, language variety, and more. It shows F1-scores averaged over gold test set instances and percentage differences between gold test set and perspective-based test set annotations, highlighting variations in IAA scores for each dimension.

The final part of the slide presents tables comparing the performance of perspective-aware vs. standard non-perspectivist models. It notes that perspective-aware models are inclined to be more confident when tested on a test set representative of their respective perspective. The table compares F1-scores, confidence levels, and percentage differences between these two types of models, showing how perspective-aware models perform better in terms of both accuracy and confidence. 

Overall, the slides provide an extensive overview of the methodology, challenges, and results related to understanding and modeling irony perception in natural language processing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The presentation begins with a slide titled 'From Dogwhistles to Horns,' introducing the concept of dogwhistles and their evolution into explicit terms like 'cosmopolitan.' It highlights that while dogwhistles are coded language, they can be decoded by audiences familiar with them. The project aims to create a typology and glossary for these expressions, conduct case studies on historical political speeches, evaluate how well language models recognize dogwhistles, and demonstrate how dogwhistles evade content moderation systems.\n\nThe narrative continues with an explanation of what constitutes a dogwhistle, using examples from Josh Hawley's tweets. It emphasizes the need for better detection mechanisms due to GPT-3 missing many instances of dogwhistles in its training data. A table categorizes various types of hate speech, including racist, antisemitic, transphobic slurs, and standard group labels, showing which categories have higher toxicity scores when swapped out for each other.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to evaluating the performance of different language models (GPT-3, Perspective API) across three metrics: toxicity, severe toxicity, and identity attack. It notes significant variations in model outputs based on prompt type, highlighting issues related to recency or domain effects in training data. The final slides emphasize the importance of understanding context in detecting toxic phrases, as seen through the example of "tax relief" being rated less toxic than actual slurs.\n\nThroughout the presentation, there is a consistent focus on explaining the methodology behind identifying and analyzing dogwhistles, demonstrating practical applications such as recognizing and evading dogwhistles, and showcasing results comparing different language models' performances. The detailed analysis includes visual aids like bar charts illustrating toxicity levels under different conditions, reinforcing key points about the effectiveness and limitations of current detection

    <sample id="298">The slide titled 'Named Entity Recognition &amp; Generalization' introduces the topic with a focus on evaluating CoNLL-2003 data and its relevance to modern NER tasks. It highlights key points such as model architecture, larger model size, fine-tuning examples, performance drop causes like temporal drift and adaptive overfitting, and concludes by questioning if CoNLL-2003 taggers are still relevant today. The Georgia Tech logo is visible in the bottom right corner throughout the presentation.\n\nThe next section discusses the impact of temporal drift on model performance, showing how different models perform across various years from 2004 to 2018. Models include Flair, BERT-base, BERT-large, BERT-base-CNN, BERT-large-CNN, and LUKE. A graph illustrates the performance trends for these models, indicating that while some models show improvement or stability, others experience decline due to temporal drift.\n\nThe following sections delve into specific aspects affecting model performance, including the influence of temporal drift and not adapting well to changes over time. Key takeaways emphasize the need for better generalization through improved model architecture, larger model sizes, more fine-tuning examples, and addressing issues related to temporal drift and adaptability.\n\nThe final slides provide references and contact information for further details: Paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09747), Dataset (https://github.com/ShuhengL/ac2023_conllpp), and Contact email (sliu775@gatech.edu). These resources offer additional insights into the research presented during the lecture series at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nThe concluding remarks affirm the continued relevance of CoNLL-2003 taggers, emphasizing their enduring utility despite challenges posed by temporal drift and other factors. This comprehensive overview underscores the importance of understanding and mitigating these issues to maintain effective named entity recognition systems.\n\nThe detailed analysis provided ensures clarity about the current state of Named Entity Recognition techniques and the ongoing efforts to enhance their applicability and effectiveness in contemporary contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="299">The video begins with a title slide that reads 'Improving the robustness of NLI models through minimax training,' presented by Michalis Korakakis and Andreas Vlachos from the University of Cambridge, Department of Computer Science. The background is white with black text, featuring the university's logo at the bottom center. This sets the stage for discussing techniques to enhance Natural Language Inference (NLI) model robustness using minimax training.\n\nNext, the focus shifts to 'Shortcut learning in NLI models.' It explains how shortcuts are decision rules that spuriousely correlate with labels, emphasizing their impact on model performance.
