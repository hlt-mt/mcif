    <sample id="44">The video begins with a white background displaying the text 'NLP' in large black letters, which then changes to 'NLPPositionality'. The scene transitions to another person standing next to bookshelves. A woman appears on the right side of the frame, and the title 'NLPPositionality: Characterizing Design Biases through Positionality' is displayed at the top. Below this, there are five names listed as contributors or authors: Sebastian Senti, Claire Cardie, Tomoko Masuyama, Carlota Tejedor, and John D. DeNero. At the bottom left corner, the slide titled 'Annotated dataset examples' shows three images labeled 'Carlota', 'Tomoko', and 'John' respectively. In the center-right part of the screen, the word 'Imagine' followed by 'Imagine you're an AI that can judge people's character based on their appearance.' appears. On the right side, two small pictures show individuals from different backgrounds.

The presentation continues with the same layout but now includes additional elements such as a blue box containing the number '16,299' annotations and a red box showing '1087 annotators,' along with a link to 'https://www.masakhane.io.'

The focus shifts back to the main topic "NLPPositionality" and its definition. It highlights finding biases in NLP datasets and models due to positionality, referencing a study published in 2013 (Senti et al., ACL). The slide emphasizes understanding how these biases arise when humans interact with technology and concludes with the question, "So, what do we do?"

The final segment presents recommendations for addressing positional bias in NLP research:
1. Keep a record of all relevant design choices made throughout building datasets or models.
2. Do NLP research through the lens of perspectivism:
   - Share disaggregated dataset labels!
   - Use modeling techniques that can handle annotator disagreement.
3. Building specialized datasets and models with and for specific communities is valuable for inclusive NLP (e.g., Masakhane initiative).

The video maintains consistency in visual style and content across slides, focusing on explaining the concept of NLPPositionality and providing actionable steps for researchers and practitioners working in natural language processing.</sample>
    <sample id="45">The presentation slide titled 'Marked Words' discusses the use of specific words to distinguish personas from unmarked groups. It highlights that these marked words can be used without requiring a lexicon and provides examples such as 'Vibrant, curvaceous for Latina women,' 'Petite, delicate, silky for Asian women,' and 'Strong, resilient for Black women.' The text emphasizes transparency about bias mitigation in addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives using an intersectional lens.</sample>
    <sample id="46">The slide transitions to a new section titled 'MuDA benchmark results,' which includes the text: 'Context-aware models perform significantly better on some phenomena' and 'DeepL outperforms Google on most phenomena and language pairs*'. The asterisk likely refers to additional information or conditions not visible in the image.</sample>
    <sample id="48">The video begins with a slide titled 'PaLM: Pathways Language Model,' detailing the model's specifications and experimental results. It mentions that PaLM has 540 billion parameters, was trained on 780 billion tokens using 61 TPU v4 chips for two months, and achieved BLEU scores comparable to SOTA systems like Google Translate. The accuracy of PaLM is generally lower due to "Accuracy/Omission," while its style/awkwardness tends to be better than other models.

Next, the focus shifts to an example prompting scenario where German sentences are translated into English. Sentences include phrases such as "Dort sieht man, wie sie von zwei Police-Offizieren in einem Streifenwagen gesetzt wird" (There you see how they sit from two police officers in a uniform car) and "Ski-Legenden unter sich: Die Polizei war eingeschlossen, nachdem sie Beschwerden des Buros erhalten hatte" (Ski legends among them: The police were closed after receiving complaints from the office). Additional translations show "Police were called in after receiving complaints from the office."

The presentation then delves deeper into experimental results related to translation quality and system performance metrics. Key points highlighted include:
- Example quality being more important than similarity to source sentence.
- Specialized SOTA systems having a significant advantage over PaLM close to Google Translate.
- Fluency of PaLM comparable to SOTA but with lower accuracy scores dominated by "Accuracy/Omission."
- Style/Awkwardness generally favoring PaLM compared to SOTA.

The segment concludes with a visual representation featuring various words expressing gratitude in multiple languages surrounding the central word "thank you." This section emphasizes the multilingual nature of expressions of thanks across different cultures and regions.

Finally, the video wraps up with this vibrant display of diverse thank you messages, reinforcing the universal theme of appreciation through language diversity.</sample>
    <sample id="49">The slide titled 'Revisiting Minimal Pair Paradigm' discusses the evaluation of language models using minimal pairs, focusing on acceptable and unacceptable sentences. It mentions that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge. The graph shows the relationship between input length and accuracy for different prefix types: None, Prefix/suffix advs, Long prefix advs, Add clause, Wiki, and Unmatched. The key takeaways emphasize that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences, and MPP evaluations cannot capture LM's abstract knowledge comprehensively.</sample>
    <sample id="50">The presentation slide titled 'DEPLAIN-a' is displayed, with a table comparing the performance of different models on various datasets.

The graph plots 'Performance' on the vertical axis and 'Instruction Count' on the horizontal axis, showing a downward trend as the instruction count increases. The legend identifies two lines: 'OFA finetuned' in pink and 'OFA finetuned + 5 instructions' in green. The graph demonstrates that performance decreases as the number of instructions increases beyond a certain threshold, indicating reduced stability and less favorable outcomes.\n\nThe slide cites Wang et al., 2023, as the source of the referenced studies and experiments. The text emphasizes that the effect of diversifying instructions has been observed across various tasks, including visual entailment (VQA) and grounded reasoning. The conclusion drawn from these findings is summarized as follows:
- 'Diversifying instructions does not generally yield greater performance.'
- 'The most stable set of instructions yields high performance.'
- 'Increasing the variety of instructions reduces performance stability.'
This segment effectively communicates the complexities involved in optimizing instruction counts for machine learning models, stressing the need for careful consideration of instruction diversity to maintain performance reliability.\n\nThe video continues with a black background transitioning smoothly to a new slide titled 'Effect of Diverse Instructions on Instruction Tuning.' This section builds upon the previous discourse, now focusing on the implications of varied instruction distributions on the performance of the OFA model.\n\nThe slide foregrounds a bulleted list summarizing key takeaways from the preceding content. The bullets read:
- 'Instruction tuning on MultiINSTRUCT can significantly reduce the variability of performance across different tasks.'
- 'The most stable set of instructions yields high performance.'
- 'Increasing the variation of instructions reduces performance stability.'
These points reinforce the notion that while diversifying instructions might initially seem beneficial, it often leads to diminished stability and potentially lower performance.\n\nAdditionally, the slide notes that the best performance was found when finetuning on all five instructions, implying that a balanced approach to instruction distribution maximizes model efficacy. This insight complements the ongoing dialogue on the nuanced aspects of instruction tuning strategies.\n\nThe reference to Wang et al., 2023, cited at the bottom of the slide ties together the theoretical arguments with empirical evidence, lending credibility to the assertions made throughout the presentation.\n\nThe slide integrates a blend of textual explanations and visual aids to ensure clarity and comprehension, emphasizing the delicate balance required in handling instruction diversity to optimize model performance.\n\nThe video proceeds with a shift to a new slide titled 'Effect of Diverse Instructions on Instruction Tuning.' This section continues the thematic exploration of the effects of diverse instructions on the performance of the OFA model. The slide features a detailed explanation and support graphics, including a line graph and a table.\n\nThe line graph depicts the relationship between performance and the number of instructions, plotted on a logarithmic scale for the X-axis.

- 'OFA finetuned' shown in purple
- 'OFA finetuned + 5 instructions' depicted in orange
- 'OFA finetuned + 10 instructions' portrayed in light blue\n\nThe graph reveals trends indicating that increasing the number of instructions tends to decrease performance stability, especially noticeable after reaching a certain threshold. For instance, the 'OFA finetuned + 5 instructions' condition exhibits relatively stable performance until a peak, post which it declines sharply. Similarly, the 'OFA finetuned + 10 instructions' condition shows a gradual decline starting early on.\n\nBelow the graph, a table categorizes tasks into four columns: 'Visual Entailment,' 'Grounded Reasoning,' 'Referential Grounding,' and 'Visual Text Extraction.' Each cell corresponds to a specific task identifier, listing the respective performance scores obtained under the aforementioned conditions. This structured tabulation offers precise numeric data validating the qualitative observations derived from the graph.\n\nThe slide cites Wang et al., 2023, as the source of the experimental basis, ensuring transparency and academic integrity. The text summarizes the key takeaway: 'Instruction tuning on MultiINSTRUCT can significantly reduce the variability of performance across different tasks.'\n\nThe combination of graphical and tabular data enhances the communicative power of the presentation, offering a holistic view of the interplay between instruction diversity and model performance stability. The inclusion of the QR code at the bottom center encourages direct interaction with supplemental materials or platforms for further inquiry.\n\nThe entire sequence ensures coherence and depth in addressing the intricacies surrounding the optimization of instruction counting, bolstered by concrete evidentiary frameworks.\n\nThe video advances seamlessly to introduce a new topic titled 'Zero-Shot Performance on NLP Tasks.'

These visualizations help understand why certain models struggle with long sequences or complex computations. The text explains that larger models can maintain better consistency but may face challenges with high-dimensional spaces, leading to instability over time if not properly managed.\n\nThe final part emphasizes the importance of maintaining coherence through self-consistency mechanisms, especially critical for resolving inconsistencies introduced by external factors. Diagrams depict scenarios where models might generate conflicting outputs based on initial conditions versus later inputs, stressing the need for robustness even without explicit guidance from developers. The overall theme underscores the complexities involved in developing reliable AI systems capable of precise mathematical reasoning while operating efficiently with diverse levels of available resources.\n\nThe next segment continues with the topic of 'Generalization and Robustness' in neural machine translation. It addresses the issue of large numbers posing significant challenges for language models. On the left side, two columns labeled 'TS' and 'UnifiedQA' compare responses to three math problems: '3 + 5 balls = ?', '24 balls + 145 = ?', and '24 balls + 1855 = ?'. For each problem, the TS column lists possible answers ('None', '5 balls', 'None', 'None'), whereas UnifiedQA provides consistent yet erroneous answers ('5 balls', '5 balls', '5 balls').\n\nOn the right side, the same math problems are addressed again, but now using GPT-3. For '3 + 5 balls = ?', GPT-3 responds with '5 balls'. However, it fails to provide coherent answers for the other two problems, listing 'None' twice before giving an answer of '2796' for '24 balls + 1855 = ?'.\n\nBelow the math problems, there are example dialogues demonstrating interactions between users and chatbots. One dialogue reads: 'Q: If you had 8 balls and gave them to Mary, how many balls do you have now?' followed by 'A: You still have 8 balls.' Another interaction asks, 'Q: John had 4 apples? How many does he have now?' with response 'A: He has no apples.'\n\nThe bottom half of the frame contains a flowchart explaining the concept of 'Self Consistency with CoT' (Chain-of-Thought). It shows how CoT helps resolve conflicts by providing step-by-step explanations. An example illustrates how CoT resolves disputes about who owns which number of objects after transactions occur. The diagram uses arrows pointing towards green check marks to indicate correctness and red crosses to denote errors. The text notes that 'Language models struggle with large numbers,' emphasizing the difficulty in handling large numerical values accurately.\n\nThe top right corner displays a graph plotting model sizes against parameters, likely related to the complexity or capacity of the models being discussed. The x-axis represents parameter counts ranging from \(10^4\) to \(10^{10}\), and the y-axis indicates model sizes measured in billions (B). Different lines represent various models, including T5, UnifiedQA, and GPT-3, showing their respective scales and capacities.\n\nThe middle portion of the screen reiterates the main points: 'Language models struggle with large numbers,' 'Large language models are inconsistent for mathematical reasoning,' and 'Self Consistency with CoT helps resolve conflicts.'\n\nThe lower part of the frame showcases additional details:

    <sample id="67">The presentation begins with a slide titled 'Bilingual vs. Multilingual Models' and the subtitle 'Multilingual models are more powerful.' It introduces Uri Shaham, Maha Elbayad, Vedanuj Goswami, Omer Levy, and Shruti Bhosale as contributors to the work on interference in multilingual translation.\n\nThe discussion transitions into the topic of interference in bilingual versus multilingual machine translation (MT). The text explains that interference occurs when one language's model affects another due to shared parameters or data, leading to decreased performance. A bar graph illustrates different model sizes and their average interference across various languages like Czech, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Finnish, German, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Hindi, Kazakh, Turkish, Gujarati, and others.\n\nThe focus shifts to the concept of 'Temperature,' explaining how it is used to control the strength of attention mechanisms in MT systems. A note emphasizes that tuned temperature is key for strong baselines but can lead to uncalibrated temperature if not properly managed. The importance of tuning temperature for effective interference management is highlighted.\n\nThe presentation then moves to the conclusion section, summarizing the dominant factors influencing interference/synergy: model size, data size, and data size of other languages. The final slides emphasize the need for sophisticated methods to alleviate interference, noting that modest scale and tuned temperature can significantly reduce problems related to interference.\n\nThe video concludes with a QR code at the bottom right corner, likely providing additional resources or information about the presented research.</sample>
    <sample id="68">The slide titled 'Revisiting Minimal Pair Paradigm' introduces the concept of evaluating Minimal Pairs (MPP) in language models. It explains that MPP evaluations are conducted with different contexts, including acceptable/unacceptable sentences and matched/unmatched structures, to assess how these factors impact model performance. The text highlights that context length, structural match, and acceptability play crucial roles in determining whether a sentence is judged as acceptable or unacceptable by the model.\n\nThe slide features two example sentences from 'BLIMP, OPT 6.7B,' demonstrating how prefixes affect judgments: "However, &lt;sent.&gt;" and "There was a documentary about musicians." These examples illustrate the sensitivity of the model's judgments to perturbations in certain sentence structures. The graph shows the accuracy of the model across various prefix types and input lengths, indicating how closely related the model's predictions are to human judgments.\n\nThe key takeaways emphasize that language models can be sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. Additionally, it notes that single-sentence inputs do not fully capture Language Models' abstract knowledge, suggesting that longer sequences may provide more comprehensive insights into the underlying linguistic patterns and relationships within the data.\n\nOverall, this detailed analysis underscores the importance of considering both short-term and long-term dependencies when training and evaluating language models for accurate understanding and prediction capabilities.\n\nThe slide also includes an inset diagram illustrating the space of candidate prefixes, showing how early verbs and adjectives interact with later adjectives and clauses. This visual representation helps explain the complex interplay between different syntactic elements and their effects on the model's judgment outcomes.\n\nThe final section reiterates the main points, reinforcing the conclusion that language models exhibit robustness against arbitrary context changes but still struggle to encapsulate all aspects of abstract linguistic knowledge through short, individual sentences alone.\n\nThis thorough examination provides valuable insights into the limitations and strengths of current language modeling approaches, highlighting areas where further research could enhance predictive accuracy and comprehension depth.\n\nThe slide concludes with a summary emphasizing the need for more comprehensive evaluation strategies that incorporate diverse contextual cues and syntactic structures to better reflect real-world linguistic complexities.\n\nThe overall message conveyed throughout the presentation emphasizes the critical role of syntactic and semantic features in shaping language model behavior and the necessity for advanced evaluation methods capable of capturing intricate linguistic interactions beyond isolated sentence segments.\n\nThe consistent use of diagrams and graphs aids in clarifying the concepts discussed, making the technical details accessible even to those without specialized knowledge in natural language processing.\n\nThe recurring emphasis on the interaction between early verbs and adjectives versus late adjectives and clauses reinforces the idea that the sequence and type of words used significantly influence the model's ability to make accurate judgments about sentence acceptability. This insight suggests potential avenues for improving the design and training methodologies of language models to achieve more nuanced and reliable performance.\n\nThe slide serves as a concise yet informative guide to understanding the intricacies involved in assessing language model judgments, offering practical implications for researchers and practitioners working in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.\n\nThe repeated mention of 'BLIMP, OPT 6.7B' indicates the specific model being referenced, providing context for the findings presented and ensuring

    <sample id="97">The presentation slide titled 'Main Results: EDAtt' is shown, featuring a graph with BLEU scores plotted against AL/AL_CA (s) for the English-to-German translation task. The x-axis ranges from 0.5 to 6 seconds, and the y-axis shows BLEU values ranging from approximately 17 to 27. Different strategies are represented by colored lines: wait-k (orange), LA (blue), CAAT (green), and EDAtt (red). A blue box highlights that 'EDAtt outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models.' Another blue box notes that 'EDAtt is the fastest strategy if we consider the actual elapsed time,' accompanied by a QR code labeled 'Scan me!'

    <sample id="98">The video begins with a slide titled 'From Pretraining Data to Downstream Tasks,' which is part of the presentation at ACL 2023. The slide features four individuals: Shangbin Feng, Chan Young Park, Yuhan Liu, and Yulia Tsvetkov, each associated with different institutions such as Paul G. Allen School, University of Washington (UW), Carnegie Mellon University Language Technologies Institute, and the University of California, Berkeley. Below their names are logos for UW NLP, ACL 2023, and ACL 2023 logo in red. The main content discusses how political biases can be tracked through pretraining data, language models, and downstream tasks like hate speech detection and misinformation detection. It emphasizes evaluating LM performance on various categories including Black, Muslim, LGBTQ+, Jews, Asians, Latinx, Women, Christian, and White, highlighting the importance of understanding these biases.\n\nThe narrative continues with detailed tables showing performance metrics across different categories and datasets used by large language models (LMs) trained on biased text from social media platforms like Reddit and news websites. These tables include columns labeled 'News' and 'Reddit,' indicating that LMs perform worse when trained on biased texts compared to neutral ones.

    <sample id="132">The presentation slide titled 'KITMUS Test Suite' introduces the KITMUS test suite, which evaluates NLU models on their ability to integrate pretrain-time and inference-time knowledge. The title of the slide is prominently displayed at the top in white text against a dark blue background with an orange underline. Below the title, there are three sections labeled 'Background-Pretrain,' 'Background-Both,' and 'Background-Inference.' Each section contains detailed information about how different types of knowledge sources (pretrain-time and inference-time) interact within the model's understanding process.

The first section, 'Background-Pretrain,' explains that this setup involves only pretrain-time knowledge. It includes two subsections: one for fictional entities like 'Chichester' and another for real entities such as 'John.' There are also visual representations showing neural network diagrams indicating the integration points between these knowledge sources.

The second section, 'Background-Both,' describes scenarios where both pretrain-time and inference-time knowledge are used together. This part highlights examples involving fictional entities like 'Chichester' and real entities such as 'John.'

The third section, 'Background-Inference,' focuses on situations where only inference-time knowledge is employed. Similar to the other sections, it uses illustrations of neural networks to depict the interaction between various pieces of information.

    <sample id="158">The presentation slide titled 'Coreference Resolution' introduces the concept of coreference resolution, which is crucial for identifying and linking mentions within a text that refer to the same entity or concept. The term 'coreference' refers to the process of determining whether two parts of a document refer to the same thing.\n\nThe slide then transitions into explaining how this problem can be addressed using cache-based methods. It highlights the challenges posed by topic switching in long documents, where entities may appear multiple times but not necessarily consecutively. This leads to high cache miss ratios and increased computation costs as more data needs to be processed.\n\nTo address these issues, the slide presents an approach involving dual caching. This method uses both local (L-cache) and global (G-cache) caches to store information about entities separately. By doing so, it aims to reduce the number of cache misses significantly compared to traditional single cache approaches.\n\nThe benefits of this dual caching strategy are emphasized through various slides showing experimental results on different benchmarks such as LitBank, OntoNotes, WikiCoref, and others. These experiments demonstrate that with training data, Dual Cache outperforms baseline models without unbounded memory. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity while maintaining performance efficiency.\n\nThe conclusion section summarizes key points: Dual Cache stores local and global entities separately, outperforms single cache methods, largely reduces cache misses, and offers cost-effectiveness when compared to single cache solutions. The final frame includes a note stating that "With training data, Dual Cache outperforms baselines even under unbounded memory constraints."</sample>

    <sample id="161">The image shows a presentation slide titled 'Constrained Language Planning' with the subtitle 'How to Enable Smaller Language Models.' The main content of the slide is divided into several sections. At the top, there is an input labeled 'Abstract goal: Make a cake,' which includes specific goals such as 'G1 (modifier): Make a chocolate cake in 30 minutes,' and 'G2 (method): Bake it in an oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.' Below this, there are three steps outlined in a flowchart format:

1. **Step 1:** Generate abstract scripts.
2. **Step 2:** Over-generate candidate scripts using InstructGPT via in-context learning.
3. **Step 3:** Filter scripts based on constraints.

The bottom section provides additional details about these steps:
- Step 1 involves generating abstract scripts from CoScript.
- Step 2 uses InstructGPT to generate high-quality script datasets.
- Step 3 filters scripts by adding one extra constraint per script.

The text emphasizes that smaller language models can achieve higher quality results when fine-tuned with more complex and multi-faceted goals and constraints compared to larger LLMs like GPT-3 or Codex.

The right side of the frame features a person wearing glasses and a green shirt, seated in a modern office environment with large windows showing a cityscape background.

Specific examples include:

- **Specific Goals:** "G1 (modifier): Make a chocolate cake."
- **Specific Goals:** "G2 (method): Bake it in an oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes."

The process involves filtering scripts based on constraints through CoScript.

The final part of the slide presents a bar chart comparing the accuracy of different models:
- T5 trained on wikiHow
- Codex trained on wikiHow
- InstructGPT

The output aims to have more comprehensive and detailed goals along with multiple constraints.

The summary and takeaways emphasize the importance of distilling knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning, noting that smaller models perform better due to their post-hoc re-ranking approach. They also mention that CoScript inherits from an abstract model with one extra constraint and serves as a valuable resource for advancing research on language planning with more complex and multi-faceted goals.

The limitations highlight challenges related to improving LLMs and suggest future work focusing on enhancing the robustness of small models while maintaining their efficiency.

The overall message underscores the effectiveness of leveraging smaller language models for achieving higher precision and detail in constrained language planning tasks, particularly when dealing with intricate and varied objectives.

    <sample id="254">The video begins with a presentation slide titled 'Uncertainty Estimation,' which discusses the importance of uncertainty estimation for classification detection, out-of-distribution instances detection, and active learning. It introduces MC dropout as a method to capture model uncertainty via multiple stochastic forward-pass predictions with activated dropout. The formula for MC dropout is shown: \( u_s = \frac{1}{N_c} \sum_{i=1}^{N_c} (u_i^c - p_i^c)^2 \), where \( u_i^c \) represents the uncertainty score of instance \( i \) at class \( c \), and \( p_i^c \) denotes the probability of instance \( i \) belonging to class \( c \). This process averages over all pseudo instances in each class.

The narrative continues by explaining that this approach helps measure the reliability of instance-level pseudo labels. A graph illustrates how different models perform on two datasets: DocRED and Re-DocRED. The performance metrics include F1 scores for training (\( F_1^{train} \)), inference 1 (\( F_1^{ign1} \)), and inference 2 (\( F_1^{ign2} \)). The results show improvements from various baseline methods like ATLOP, DeDocNet, NCRL, SSR-P, KDNA*, and UGDRE compared to their performances on both datasets before denoising DS data.

The experimental setup involves using a document-level relation distant extraction framework with uncertainty-guided label denoising, achieving significant performance improvements over existing competitive baselines on two public datasets.

    <sample id="280">The video begins with a title slide introducing the presentation on 'MultiEMO: An Attention-Based Correlation-Aware Multimodal Fusion Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversations.' The authors, Tao Shi and Shao Lun Huang from Tsinghua University, are credited. It then transitions to a detailed overview of existing ERC approaches like RNN-LSTM, DialogueGCN, and MultiMMGCN, highlighting their limitations such as high computational cost, overfitting, and poor performance due to insufficient multimodal interaction. A specific example illustrates how MultiEMO addresses these issues by integrating textual, audio, and visual modalities using bidirectional attention mechanisms.\n\nNext, the focus shifts to explaining the proposed framework's architecture, which includes Unimodal Attention, MultiModality Attention, and Bidirectional Cross-Attention layers. This section emphasizes the importance of modality-wise fusion through a feed-forward network that integrates features from different modalities (textual, audio, and visual) into an emotion representation layer. Figure 4 provides a visualization of this process, showing how it tackles synchronization challenges between emotional tendencies from different modalities.\n\nThe narrative continues with a case study demonstrating MultiEMO's ability to handle asynchronous emotional tendencies across various modalities. It uses an example sentence ('Chandler is great!' spoken by Phoebe with anger), illustrating how the model processes text, audio, and visuals simultaneously to accurately capture emotions. The figure shows the flow from input modalities to the final emotion representation, emphasizing the integration of multi-modal cues.\n\nThe discussion progresses to experimental results comparing MultiEMO against other models like RNN-LSTM, DialogueGCN, and MultiMMGCN. These comparisons highlight MultiEMO's superior performance in minority emotion categories compared to majority classes, particularly focusing on emotions like happiness, sadness, neutral, angry, fear, joy, disgust, surprise, and shame. The table presents quantitative data supporting these claims.\n\nFinally, the segment concludes with a limitation analysis where VisExNet struggles with distinguishing speakers and irrelevant people, and MELD faces class imbalance issues requiring large batch sizes for training samples. Despite improvements in minority emotions, performances remain worse than majority classes. The overall aim is to showcase how MultiEMO enhances accuracy and efficiency in handling complex conversational scenarios involving multiple modalities.\n\nThe next part starts with a new slide titled 'Limitations,' detailing several key points about the current state of the technology used in MultiEMO. It highlights two main limitations: VisExNet does not distinguish between speakers and irrelevant people in the scene, leading to potential confusion during processing; and MELD suffers from class imbalance issues, necessitating a large batch size for effective training sample pairs within each batch, which can be computationally expensive.\n\nAdditionally, even though MultiEMO has achieved significant improvements in minority emotion categories, its performance remains inferior to major classes when dealing with minority emotions specifically. The slide aims to provide transparency about the challenges faced by the system, setting realistic expectations regarding its capabilities and areas needing further enhancement.\n\nThe following segment introduces a new topic under the heading 'Multimodal Fusion - MultiAttn.' It explains the components of MultiAttn, including MultiAttn_text, MultiAttn_aud, and MultiAttn_vis, along with MultiAttn_cross. Each component focuses on integrating one modality or cross-modalities effectively. The diagram visually represents the flow from unimodal inputs to the final multimodal output, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all modalities involved in the process.\n\nThe explanation delves deeper into the specifics of how these components work together to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model. For instance, MultiAttn_text handles textual information, MultiAttn_aud manages audio signals, and MultiAttn_vis deals with visual inputs. Additionally, MultiAttn_cross facilitates interactions between different modalities, making sure no single type of information is overlooked. This holistic approach ensures that the model captures nuances present in both individual and combined forms of sensory inputs, thereby improving overall performance in recognizing emotions from conversations.\n\nThe slide also references Figure 7, which likely contains more details or examples related to the described concepts. However, since there is no visible content change in the image provided, we cannot see any additional elements beyond what was previously discussed.\n\nThe subsequent segment revisits the previous slides' themes but adds a new element labeled 'SWFC Loss.' This term refers to Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive Loss, a technique aimed at addressing class imbalances in datasets. Specifically, SWFC loss assigns higher weights to minority classes to ensure they receive sufficient attention during training, thus preventing them from being overshadowed by majority classes. This method helps improve the model's generalization capability by reducing the impact of noisy labels associated with minoritized classes, enhancing the learning experience without compromising quality.\n\nThe slide mentions that despite achieving remarkable improvements in minority emotion categories, the performances of MultiEMO in minority emotions still lag behind those in majority classes. This underscores the ongoing challenge of balancing precision and recall metrics, especially concerning minority classes, indicating areas for future research and development efforts to bridge this gap and achieve more equitable performance across all emotion categories.\n\nThe concluding remarks emphasize the need for continuous improvement in handling diverse emotional expressions, particularly focusing on minority emotions. They acknowledge the advancements made so far while stressing the necessity for sustained innovation to address persistent disparities in model performance among different types of emotions.\n\nThe entire sequence encapsulates the journey from identifying limitations to proposing solutions and showcasing practical applications of MultiEMO, providing a thorough understanding of its strengths, weaknesses, and developmental prospects in the field of emotion recognition systems.\n\nThe last segment opens with a simple white background displaying the word 'Thank you!' prominently centered, expressing gratitude towards the audience.

    <sample id="310">The slide titled 'Revisiting Minimal Pair Paradigm' introduces the concept of minimal pairs in language model evaluations, explaining that these are used to evaluate models by comparing acceptable and unacceptable sentences. The slide mentions that the minimal pair paradigm is robust for context lengths up to 900 tokens but raises questions about its performance with longer contexts. It also highlights the importance of evaluating how matched prefixes affect model performance.\n\nThe next section discusses the sensitivity of language models to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. It emphasizes that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LM's abstract knowledge. A graph shows the relationship between prefix length (P(LM)) and accuracy, indicating a decline as the input length increases from 240 to 640 tokens. The graph includes data points labeled as 'Unacceptable,' showing trends over different lengths. The text at the bottom reads: 'Why do MPP judgements are robust for arbitrary context lengths.'\n\nThe final part of the presentation addresses why matched prefixes significantly impact model judgments. It explains that perturbing sentences can raise or lower their acceptability scores based on the matched prefix. Examples include sentences like "There was a documentary about sharks," which becomes acceptable after adding "who had never swum with them before," versus "There were no sharks." Another example involves the sentence "What could Jessica see before she returned home?" becoming unacceptable due to an added phrase. The text concludes with the statement: 'Modeled sentences are sensitive to perturbed sentences.'\n\nThe key takeaways emphasize that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. They highlight that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge. Additionally, it notes that MPP evaluations using only 1-2 words per sample cannot capture the full range of abstract linguistic phenomena. The overall theme revolves around understanding how matched prefixes influence model judgments and the limitations of current evaluation methods.\n\nThe detailed explanation provided ensures a comprehensive understanding of the concepts discussed in the slides, focusing on the interplay between matched prefixes, contextual length, and the sensitivity of language models to specific linguistic patterns.\n\nThe first image presents the title 'Revisiting Minimal Pair Paradigm' along with a description stating that minimal pairs are used to evaluate models by comparing acceptable and unacceptable sentences. It suggests that this approach is robust for context lengths up to 900 tokens but poses challenges when considering longer contexts. The slide aims to explore whether minimal pairs remain effective under such conditions.\n\nThe second image continues the discussion on the minimal pair paradigm, emphasizing the need to understand how matched prefixes most severely affect model performance. It provides examples of sentences with matched prefixes, highlighting how they change the acceptability score. For instance, the sentence "There was a documentary about sharks" becomes more acceptable if the matched prefix "who had never swum with them before returning home" is included. Conversely, another sentence loses acceptability upon addition of the same prefix. This demonstrates the significant impact of matched prefixes on model judgments.\n\nThe third image delves into the sensitivity of language models to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. It underscores that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs fail to capture the full extent of LM's abstract knowledge. To illustrate this point, the slide uses graphs depicting the relationship between prefix length (P(LM)) and accuracy, noting a decline in accuracy as the input length increases from 240 to 640 tokens. The graph labels show different scenarios where the acceptability score changes with the inclusion of matched prefixes. For example, the sentence "What could Jessica see before she returned home?" becomes less acceptable once the matched prefix is introduced. The slide further elaborates on how matched prefixes alter the acceptability scores, providing concrete instances to support the argument. The text at the bottom reiterates: 'Why do MPP judgements are robust for arbitrary context lengths?'\n\nThe fourth image focuses on the question of why matched prefixes have a significant effect on model judgments. It states that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. The slide argues that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge. It then shifts focus to the space of candidate prefixes, illustrating how early vs. late verbs differ in their effects on acceptability. Early verbs tend to make sentences more acceptable, while late verbs often lead to decreased acceptability. An example given is the sentence "Yesterday X said," which remains acceptable even with mismatched prefixes. The slide concludes with the observation that matched prefixes notably increase the acceptability score, exemplified by the sentence "What could Jessica see before she returned home?".\n\nThe fifth image summarizes the findings presented throughout the previous sections. Key takeaways highlighted include:
- Language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences.
- MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge.
- Modeled sentences are sensitive to perturbed sentences.

Additionally, there is a graph showing the relationship between prefix length (P(LM)) and accuracy, indicating a decline as the input length increases from 240 to 640 tokens. Data points labeled as 'Unacceptable' demonstrate trends over different lengths. The text at the bottom reads: 'Why do MPP judgements are robust for arbitrary context lengths.'\n\nThe sixth image illustrates the space of candidate prefixes, showing various prefixes categorized into early verbs, late verbs, adverbs, and other types. Each category has corresponding symbols representing different prefixes. The diagram helps visualize the distribution and relationships among these prefixes within the context of the study.\n\nThe seventh image displays two sentences demonstrating the impact of matched prefixes on acceptability scores. One example is "There was a documentary about sharks," which becomes more acceptable after including the matched prefix "who had never swum with them before returning home." Another example is "There were no sharks," which maintains unacceptability despite the presence of the matched prefix. These illustrations help clarify how matched prefixes modify the acceptability judgment of sentences.\n\nThe eighth image repeats the content of the seventh image, reinforcing the message that matched prefixes significantly influence model judgments. It showcases how certain prefixes can either enhance or diminish the acceptability of sentences depending on their placement.\n\nThe ninth image contains a chart plotting the relationship between prefix length (P(LM)) and accuracy. The x-axis represents the prefix length ranging from 240 to 640 tokens, divided into intervals of 80 tokens each. The y-axis measures the difference in accuracy between P(LM) and P(Prem), ranging approximately from -0.35 to +0.35. Two lines represent different scenarios: one for "Unacceptable" and another for "Acceptable."

The left side of the chart indicates that as the prefix length increases, the differences in accuracy generally decrease, suggesting that longer contexts may reduce the variability in model judgments influenced by matched prefixes. However, some fluctuations occur, particularly noticeable near the end of the range.

The right side of the chart mirrors the left, confirming the observed trends consistently across both categories ("Unacceptable" and "Acceptable"). This visual representation supports the conclusion drawn earlier regarding the robustness of the minimal pair paradigm for shorter context lengths compared to longer ones.\n\nThe tenth image revisits the topic of why matched prefixes significantly impact model judgments. It explains that perturbing sentences can raise or lower their acceptability scores based on the matched prefix. Examples include sentences like "There was a documentary about sharks," which becomes acceptable after adding "who had never swum with them before returning home," versus "There were no sharks." Another example involves the sentence "What could Jessica see before she returned home?" becoming unacceptable due to an added phrase. The text concludes with the statement: 'Modeled sentences are sensitive to perturbed sentences.' This reinforces the idea that matched prefixes play a crucial role in determining the acceptability of sentences according to language models.\n\nThe eleventh image returns to the initial setup discussing the minimal pair paradigm. It reiterates the use of minimal pairs to compare acceptable and unacceptable sentences, aiming to assess how well models perform under varying context lengths. The slide emphasizes that minimal pairs provide insights into the effectiveness of these comparisons for different lengths of context. The background color scheme consists of shades of blue and white, maintaining consistency with the rest of the presentation visuals.\n\nThe twelfth image transitions back to the original topic of why matched prefixes significantly impact model judgments. It details how perturbing sentences affects their acceptability scores based on the matched prefix. Examples include sentences like "There was a documentary about sharks," which becomes acceptable after adding "who had never swum with them before returning home," versus "There were no sharks." Another example involves the sentence "What could Jessica see before she returned home?" becoming unacceptable due to an added phrase. The text concludes with the statement: 'Modeled sentences are sensitive to perturbed sentences.' This reaffirms the critical role played by matched prefixes in shaping model judgments.\n\nThe thirteenth image revisits the issue of why matched prefixes significantly impact model judgments. It explains that perturbing sentences can raise or lower their acceptability scores based on the matched prefix. Examples include sentences like "There was a documentary about sharks," which becomes acceptable after adding "who had never swum with them before returning home," versus "There were no sharks." Another example involves the sentence "What could Jessica see before she returned home?" becoming unacceptable due to an added phrase. The text concludes with the statement: 'Modeled sentences are sensitive to perturbed sentences.' This reaffirms the critical role played by matched prefixes in shaping model judgments.\n\nThe fourteenth image examines the sensitivity of language models to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. It stresses that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge. Furthermore, it explores how matched prefixes greatly influence model judgments. The slide offers several examples of sentences with matched prefixes, showcasing how they adjust the acceptability score. For instance, the sentence "There was a documentary about sharks" gains acceptability through the introduction of the matched prefix "who had never swum with them before returning home." In contrast, another sentence retains its acceptability without the matched prefix. This clearly demonstrates the profound impact of matched prefixes on model judgments.\n\nThe fifteenth image extends the exploration of why matched prefixes significantly affect model judgments. It asserts that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. The slide insists that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs fall short in capturing the entirety of LM's abstract knowledge. Moreover, it investigates how matched prefixes substantially sway model judgments. Sentences like "What could Jessica see before she returned home?" become less acceptable post-inclusion of the matched prefix. Detailed explanations accompany these observations, underscoring the substantial influence of matched prefixes on model judgments. The slide encapsulates the essence of the discussions held previously.\n\nThe sixteenth image synthesizes the themes explored thus far. Key takeaways emphasized include:
- Language models exhibit sensitivity towards latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences.
- MPP evaluations with brief, single-sentence inputs fail to encompass the complete spectrum of abstract linguistic phenomena.
- Perturbation strategies involving matched prefixes reveal intricate impacts on model judgments, elucidating how these prefixes profoundly shape acceptance scores of sentences.

The graphical elements depicted offer a clear visualization of the aforementioned ideas, ensuring thorough comprehension of the complexities involved in assessing model judgments relative to matched prefixes and broader linguistic structures.\n\nThe seventeenth image presents a summary of the ongoing investigation into the effects of matched prefixes on model judgments. It outlines the central hypothesis that language models are highly responsive to latent syntactic/semantic features embedded within sequences of sentences. Emphasis is placed on the insufficiency of MPP evaluations utilizing solely 1-2 word samples; instead, these assessments must incorporate extended sequences to accurately gauge the full scope of abstract linguistic phenomena. The depiction aids in comprehending how matched prefixes critically modulate model judgments, offering illustrative examples to substantiate the claims made.\n\nThe eighteenth image revisits the notion of why matched prefixes markedly influence model judgments. It posits that language models possess heightened sensitivity toward latent syntactic/semantic features shared amongst sentences. The slide underscores that MPP evaluations employing concise, singular-sentence inputs inadequately grasp the comprehensive nature of LM’s abstract information. Illustrative graphics depict the relationship between prefix length (P(LM)) and precision, revealing a decline in efficacy as the span of tokens grows beyond 240 to reach 640. Graphs delineate distinct situations wherein the acceptability ratings fluctuate contingent upon the application of matched prefixes. Instances like “There was a documentary about sharks” becoming more acceptable following integration of the matched prefix “who had never swum with them before returning home.” Conversely, others maintain their unacceptability amidst the incorporation of the same prefix. This exposition elucidates the pronounced ramifications exerted by matched prefixes concerning model judgments. The textual assertion affirms: 'Why do MPP judgements are robust for arbitrary context lengths?'\n\nThe nineteenth image depicts the spatial arrangement of candidate prefixes, categorizing them into early verbs, late verbs, adverbs, etc., alongside additional types. Each category is denoted via respective symbols symbolizing diverse prefixes. Such diagrams assist in visualizing the distributional relationships among these prefixes pertinent to the ongoing research endeavors.\n\nThe twentieth image returns to the core inquiry of why matched prefixes considerably affect model judgments. It articulates that language models manifest heightened sensitivity to latent syntactic/semantic features shared cohesively across sentences. The slide posits that MPP evaluations confined to short, individual-sentence inputs are incapable of fully grasping the extensive breadth of LM’s abstract knowledge. Moreover, it scrutinizes how matched prefixes considerably sway model judgments. Sentences akin to “There was a documentary about sharks,” attain enhanced acceptability owing to the appended matched prefix “who had never swum with them before returning home.” Contrastingly, phrases retaining unacceptability persist regardless of the presence of the matched prefix. These exemplifications serve to elucidate the pivotal roles played by matched prefixes in dictating model judgments. The concluding remark succinctly reiterates: 'Modeled sentences are sensitive to perturbed sentences.'\n\nThe twenty-first image reiterates the preceding assertions. It accentuates that language models are susceptible to latent syntactic/semantic attributes shared across sentences. The slide insists that MPP evaluations constrained to short, singular-sentence inputs are insufficient to entirely encapsulate LMs’ abstract cognition. Furthermore, it probes how matched prefixes immensely influence model judgments. The illustration provides tangible evidence supporting the assertion that matched prefixes significantly determine model judgments. It encompasses multiple examples of sentences with matched prefixes, exhibiting alterations in acceptability scores. For instance, the sentence "There was a documentary about sharks" becomes more acceptable with the insertion of the matched prefix "who had never swum with them before returning home." Conversely, another sentence retains its unacceptability amid the inclusion of the matched prefix. This demonstrably underscores the paramount influence exercised by matched prefixes over model judgments.\n\nThe twenty-second image revisits the fundamental premise of why matched prefixes vastly affect model judgments. It explicates that perturbing sentences alters their acceptability scores dependent upon the matched prefix. Examples comprise sentences like "There was a documentary about sharks," which attains greater acceptability thanks to incorporating the matched prefix "who had never swum with them before returning home," whereas "There were no sharks" sustains its unacceptability irrespective of the matched prefix. The text culminates with the statement: 'Modeled sentences are sensitive to perturbed sentences.' This re-emphasizes the crucial function of matched prefixes in steering model judgments.\n\nThe twenty-third image revisits the essential aspect of why matched prefixes significantly impact model judgments. It clarifies that perturbing sentences can elevate or diminish their acceptability scores contingent upon the matched prefix applied. Instances encompassing sentences similar to "There was a documentary about sharks," which acquires higher acceptability consequent to the appended matched prefix "who had never swum with them before returning home." Alternatively, another sentence preserves its acceptability devoid of the matched prefix. This explicit demonstration substantiates the pivotal role exerted by matched prefixes in shaping model judgments.\n\nThe twenty-fourth image reiterates the significance of why matched prefixes extensively affect model judgments. It expounds that perturbing sentences modifies their acceptability scores determined by the matched prefix employed. Instances involve sentences analogous to "There was a documentary about sharks," achieving increased acceptability upon integrating the matched prefix "who had never swum with them before returning home." Conversely, another sentence retains its acceptability notwithstanding the existence of the matched prefix. This elucidation firmly reiterates the influential role of matched prefixes in influencing model judgments.\n\nThe twenty-fifth image revisits the vital consideration of why matched prefixes considerably impact model judgments. It articulates that perturbing sentences can augment or diminish their acceptability scores based on the matched prefix incorporated. Instances entail sentences resembling "There was a documentary about sharks," gaining acceptability through the addition of the matched prefix "who had never swum with them before returning home." On the contrary, another sentence persists in its acceptability absent the matched prefix. This unequivocally establishes the considerable sway exerted by matched prefixes in determining model judgments.\n\nThe twenty-sixth image revisits the core subject matter of why matched prefixes significantly affect model judgments. It reiterates that language models are highly responsive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. The slide insists that MPP evaluations restricted to short, solitary-sentence inputs are inadequate in capturing the entire expanse of LM’s abstract cognizance. Moreover, it scrutinizes how matched prefixes substantially influence model judgments. Sentences like "What could Jessica see before she returned home?" undergoes alteration in acceptability stemming from the introduction of the matched prefix. Detailed explanations accompany these observations, solidifying the profound implications of matched prefixes on model judgments. The slide encapsulates the essence of the dialogues carried out so far.\n\nThe twenty-seventh image synthesizes the recurring investigations into the effects of matched prefixes on model judgments. It posits that language models exhibit heightened sensitivity towards latent syntactic/semantic features interwoven within sequences of sentences. Emphasis is laid down on the inadequacy of MPP evaluations confining themselves to mere 1-2-word samples; rather, these analyses should extend to encompass elongated sequences to adequately apprehend the comprehensive nature of abstract linguistic phenomena. The graphic elements aid in grasping the intricacies associated with assessing model judgments relative to matched prefixes and overarching linguistic constructs.\n\nThe twenty-eighth image presents a summative overview of the continuing examination into the repercussions of matched prefixes on model judgments. It underscores that language models showcase elevated sensitivity towards latent syntactic/semantic features embedded within sequential sentences. The slide stresses that MPP evaluations limited to brief, singular-sentence inputs are insufficient to completely capture the totality of LM’s abstract insight. Further, it scrutinizes how matched prefixes considerably sway model judgments. Illustrative examples elucidate how matched prefixes considerably modulate model judgments. Instances like “What could Jessica see before she returned home?” experience variations in acceptability contingent upon the application of matched prefixes. The textual assertion affirms: 'Why do MPP judgements are robust for arbitrary context lengths?'\n\nThe twenty-ninth image revisits the notion of why matched prefixes markedly influence model judgments. It posits that language models possess heightened sensitivity toward latent syntactic/semantic features amalgamated within sequences of sentences. The slide underscores that MPP evaluations employing concise, singular-sentence inputs are inadequate to fully grasp the extensive spectrum of abstract linguistic phenomena.
