    <sample id="23">The video begins with a title slide that reads 'Character-Aware Text Encoders Improve Visual Text Rendering' in bold black letters on a white background. Below the title, there is an image of a person wearing glasses and a dark shirt against a brick wall backdrop. The text 'Google Research' appears at the bottom right corner along with the Google logo. This scene transitions to another slide titled 'Text-to-Image Modeling,' which features a diagram explaining the process: 'A sign that says "book" → input text → Text Encoder → Text-to-Image Diffusion Model.' An example output shows a book cover labeled 'BOO Book' with additional details like 'ByT5,' '100%,' '32M,' and '640x640.' A note below states, 'English words only. Results averaged across model sizes.'

Next, the focus shifts to a detailed explanation of how subword-based encoders improve visual text rendering accuracy. It highlights various errors during image generation such as excess repetitions (e.g., 'BOOOK' instead of 'BOOK'), merged glyphs ('MENTAL' instead of 'MENTAL'), misspelled glyphs ('CHANGED' instead of 'CHANGED'), and no text ('|') when characters are missing. Examples include a green dog icon next to the word 'book' and a bicycle icon for the phrase 'I want to ride my bike today.' The segment concludes with a bar graph comparing spelling accuracy between T5-XXL and ByT5 models.

The presentation continues with takeaways from the study, listing three key points:
- WikiSpell – Benchmark for text-only models.
- DrawText – Benchmark for text-to-image models.
- Efficient strategy for improving model spelling ability.

The clip then delves into character-aware text encoding techniques used by T5 models, showing examples where characters are replaced or merged to form coherent texts like 'DILL coffee,' 'COFFEE,' 'hello,' 'HELLO,' 'elephant,' 'ELEPHANT,' 'BYT5,' 'BYT5,' 'ByT5,' and 'ByT5.' Each example demonstrates improvements over subword-based encoders.

Following this, the video illustrates specific cases using the text encoder, including 'A vintage postage stamp with the message: "Canada: For Glowing Hearts"' resulting in a Canadian postage stamp design. Another example uses 'A sign that says "similarly"' leading to the word 'SIMILARLY.' These demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods compared to subword-based encoders.

The final part of the video showcases more examples of improved text rendering through character-aware text encoding. Phrases like 'A sign that says "similarly"' result in the correct word 'SIMILARLY.' Other phrases show significant improvements, such as 'A sign that says "similarly"' correctly rendered as 'SIMILARLY,' while subword-based encoders produce errors like 'SIMILAR.' The consistent improvement in text rendering quality underscores the advantages of character-aware text encoding techniques.</sample>
    <sample id="24">The video provides a detailed analysis of conjunct lengths in English, focusing on the dependency structure and coordination.

    <sample id="25">The video begins with a slide titled 'Conjunct Lengths in English,' which discusses the lengths of conjunctions and their dependencies. It mentions that left conjuncts tend to be shorter (observed before) and this tendency grows with length difference, briefly noticed in Gibson et al. 1996:88–90. The text also notes that when the governor is on the right, the conjunction tends to get longer (\( \text{I saw Bart and Lisa; Homer came and sneezed} \). The example sentence provided is 'not when it is on the right (\text{Ted and Ned laughed).' The slide includes diagrams showing dependency structures for different coordination types such as Bouquet/Stanford, Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Praque, and Multi-headed/London.\n\nNext, the focus shifts to 'Dependency Structure of Coordination' where various coordination types are illustrated using dependency trees. Sentences like 'Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie.' are shown under each type, demonstrating how the positions of words affect the structure. Examples include 'Bouquet/Stanford,' 'Chain/Moscow,' 'Conjunction-headed/Praque,' and 'Multi-headed/London.'\n\nThe presentation then transitions to discussing 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM).' It explains that word order tends to minimize dependency lengths by providing examples from Gibson et al. 1996:88–90. Diagrams illustrate sentences such as 'I saw Bart and Lisa; Homer came and sneezed' and 'not when it is on the right (\text{Ted and Ned laughed}).' The slides show graphs depicting the proportion of left conjunct lengths depending on the absolute difference of conjunct lengths (with confidence bands).\n\nThe final segment revisits the compatibility between dependency structures of coordination and dependency relationships. It compares four coordination types: Bouquet/Stanford, Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Praque, and Multi-headed/London.

    <sample id="76">The video begins with a slide titled 'Evaluating LM Political Leaning,' which discusses the political leanings of language models (LMs) and their impact on downstream tasks. It emphasizes evaluating LMs for political bias, using pretraining data to train these models, and considering how they perform in downstream tasks like hate speech detection. The presentation includes visual aids such as charts comparing performance metrics across different categories like news, Muslims, LGBTQ+, Jews, Asians, Latinx, women, Christians, and more.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to the ethical implications of sanitizing or not sanitizing training data to avoid biases. A flowchart illustrates the process from pretraining data through language models to downstream tasks, highlighting the need to address political biases effectively. The segment concludes with an illustration depicting a moral dilemma involving a person choosing between two tracks: one leading to five people tied down and another avoiding them but risking one's own life.\n\nThe next part features a detailed table listing various texts categorized by target labels such as Asian, Chris, Right, Left, Fake, True, Hate Speech, and others. Each category is evaluated based on its alignment with specific sentiments like 'Asian' and 'Right.' This section underscores the complexity of categorizing text content accurately while maintaining fairness and addressing potential biases.\n\nThe narrative continues with a focus on qualitative analysis, showing examples where text targets are misaligned with actual sentiment, emphasizing the importance of accurate labeling to prevent bias. The final frames highlight the ongoing challenge of balancing accuracy and fairness in natural language processing tasks, underscoring the necessity of thorough evaluation methods.\n\nThe presentation transitions into discussing the broader topic of "Sanitization," exploring strategies to mitigate political biases in language model training. It mentions the use of synthetic datasets and provides references to relevant literature. Visual aids include diagrams illustrating the pipeline from pretraining data to language models and downstream tasks, stressing that sanitization involves removing biased data rather than altering it.\n\nThe subsequent slides delve deeper into the concept of "Sanitization" within NLP, presenting a diagram labeled 'The Trump Card' that shows the shift in political leaning when targeting hate speech against Trump supporters versus general hate speech. References to works by Gao et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; and Yang et al., 2020 are provided, along with tables summarizing performance differences before and after sanitization.\n\nThe latter parts emphasize the challenges posed by biased training data, particularly focusing on the political leanings of RoBERTa and BERT models. Tables show significant improvements in performance post-sanitization compared to baseline results, indicating enhanced fairness in detecting hate speech related to political figures like Trump and Clinton.\n\nThe final segments provide further insights into the effectiveness of sanitization techniques, showcasing improved performance in detecting hate speech targeted at politicians versus general hate speech. The importance of continuous monitoring and improvement processes to ensure fair outcomes is highlighted throughout the presentation.\n\nThe concluding remarks stress the significance of understanding the mechanisms behind political biases in language models, referencing studies by Wu et al., 2019; He et al., 2020; and Lee et al., 2020. These sections underscore the critical role of comprehensive evaluations to identify and rectify biases in NLP systems.\n\nThe overall message conveyed is the urgent need for developing unbiased AI technologies capable of handling diverse perspectives without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases, ensuring equitable treatment of all individuals regardless of their backgrounds or affiliations.\n\nThe video ends with a thank you note, acknowledging contributions from Shangbin Feng, Chan Young Park, Yuhan Liu, Yulia Tsvetkov, Paul Allen School, U.

    <sample id="77">The slide titled 'Data Collection Details' explains the process of collecting data for improving factual consistency in summaries. It includes a diagram illustrating the flow from input documents to initial system-generated summaries, and how human feedback is used to correct errors through editing instructions. The section highlights that extrinsic errors are more likely to be corrected by removing information while intrinsic errors require replacing it with accurate details. A bar graph shows the distribution of different types of editing operations (remove, replace, insert) across various systems like Pegasus, Human, CCGS, CLIFF, ReDRESS, FactPegasus, and Editor. Table 7 presents performance metrics comparing these models on datasets like Ds-1, Ds-2, etc., using ROUGE-L scores. Additional text discusses further advantages such as better human evaluation, fine-grained annotations, training new factuality metrics, and meta-evaluation. The GitHub repository link https://github.com/microsoft/DeFacto is provided at the bottom.\n\nThe next slide focuses on NLG Task 3: Explanation Automatic Factual Error Correction – Editing Model. It features a detailed explanation of an editing model's workflow, starting with the input document, generating an initial summary, receiving human feedback, and correcting errors based on this feedback. The slide emphasizes the importance of human explanations and instructions in refining the summarization models. It also mentions the dataset's use in understanding factual corrections via human-written explanations and instructions. A table compares different methods like Sys, Human, Topp, and others, showing their performance metrics including ROUGE-L scores. Another table provides specific results for each method under categories like System R1, R2, DAE, QFE, and E. The final part of the slide lists additional benefits derived from the dataset, highlighting its role in enhancing factual consistency, providing fine-grained annotations, aiding in developing novel factuality metrics, and facilitating thorough meta-evaluation. The GitHub repository link remains consistent throughout.\n\nThe following slide continues the discussion on NLG Task 3 but transitions into a broader context about the contributions of the DeFacto dataset. It reiterates the improvements in factual consistency, fine-grained annotations, training new factuality metrics, and meta-evaluation. The GitHub repository link persists at the bottom.\n\nThe subsequent slide maintains focus on the contributions of the DeFacto dataset, emphasizing improved factual consistency, fine-grained annotations, development of new factuality metrics, and comprehensive meta-evaluation. It concludes with the GitHub repository link still visible.\n\nThe last slide displays a simple white background with black text reading "Thank you!" This serves as a closing remark or acknowledgment, possibly marking the end of a presentation or session. There is no additional content beyond this message, maintaining simplicity and clarity.\n\nThe GitHub repository link https://github.com/microsoft/DeFacto appears consistently below the main body of the slides, ensuring easy access to the project resources.\n\nThe sequence of slides collectively outlines the methodology, challenges, and advancements in natural language generation tasks related to factual error correction and summarizes key takeaways and acknowledgments, concluding with a clear call to action regarding the GitHub repository.\n\nThe GitHub repository link remains unchanged

    <sample id="251">The slide titled 'Background' introduces the concept of watermarking in large language models (LLMs) and embedding-based services, emphasizing their applicability to EaaS. It details various aspects such as transferability, lexical similarity, backdoor weight, and covert watermark injection. The text explains how a covert watermark can be injected into an embedding by adding a specific term from a trigger set to the original sentence, ensuring it does not degrade performance or detection accuracy while maintaining low frequency for undetectability.</sample>
    <sample id="252">The slide titled 'Event Extraction' introduces the concept of extracting events from a legal document. It includes an example text: 'The police officer noticed that the man was driving under the influence and pulled him over.' The event extraction process is illustrated with arrows pointing to different parts of the sentence, indicating how specific actions (like 'noticed,' 'pulled him over') are identified as events.\n\nNext, there's a detailed diagram showing the flow of information through various stages such as 'Word BERT (uni),' 'Word BERT (bi),' 'Events BM25 (tri),' 'Jacc. Sim. over Events,' 'RR Filtered Docs BM25 (quad),' and 'Event Filtered Docs BM25 (quad).' Each stage has corresponding metrics like F1 scores for different models, highlighting their performance improvements or challenges in terms of accuracy and efficiency.\n\nThe final part of this section presents a table comparing unsupervised methods against supervised ones based on F1 scores across different datasets and configurations. This comparison emphasizes the strengths and weaknesses of each method, providing insights into their effectiveness in handling complex textual data within the context of legal case retrieval tasks.\n\nThe presentation continues with a new title slide labeled 'Event Based Models,' which transitions to another slide discussing 'Inference Time vs. Model Performance.' This segment features a graph plotting inference time versus model performance, showcasing multiple lines representing different models and their respective performances.

    <sample id="263">The presentation slide titled 'Mitigating the effects of label biases holistically with Domain-context calibration' introduces a typology of label biases in in-context learning for classification tasks. It emphasizes that domain-label bias is a significant source of label bias, particularly when using only one content-free token or random seeds. The slide discusses how pre-defined content-free tokens can be biased and highlights the importance of calibrating using more random English words to mitigate these biases. The graph illustrates different performance metrics across various datasets and models, showing improvements through domain-context calibration.\n\nThe text on the right side reiterates key points: 'Pre-defined content-free token, like 'N/A', can also be biased,' 'Using only one content-free token is sub-optimal,' and 'Calibrate using random in-domain words removes DLB.' Additionally, it notes that 'Domain-context calibration mitigates all three types of label biases holistically and significantly improves the in-context learning performance.'\n\nThe summary section outlines the main findings: 1. A typology of label biases in in-context learning for classification tasks; 2. Domain label bias as a major source of label bias from the task corpus; 3. Domain-context calibration's effectiveness in mitigating all types of label biases and improving model performance.\n\nThe detailed analysis includes specific examples such as 'Review: It's a good movie,' 'Review: I hate it,' and 'Review: A masterpiece!' Each review has corresponding sentiment labels ('positive' or 'negative'). The slide concludes by emphasizing the need for more random in-domain words to remove DLB (domain-level bias).\n\nThe final part of the presentation focuses on summarizing the key takeaways: 1. A typology of label biases in in-context learning for classification tasks; 2. Domain label bias being a major source of label bias from the task corpus; 3. Domain-context calibration's ability to mitigate all types of label biases and improve in-context learning performance.\n\nThe bottom left corner features logos of EPFL, ETH Zurich, and CMU, indicating their involvement in the research presented. The overall theme revolves around addressing and correcting label biases to enhance the accuracy and reliability of AI models in real-world applications.\n\nThe video continues with a white background displaying black text that summarizes the main points discussed earlier. The title reads 'Summary,' followed by three bullet points highlighting the significance of understanding label biases, identifying sources of bias, and implementing effective calibration methods.\n\nThe first bullet point states: 'A typology of label biases in in-context learning for classification tasks.' This indicates an organized framework for categorizing different types of label biases encountered during in-context learning processes.\n\nThe second bullet point addresses 'Domain label bias: the task corpus is a major source of label bias.' This underscores the critical role of the task corpus in introducing biases into the labeling process, which must be carefully managed to ensure unbiased outcomes.\n\nThe third bullet point emphasizes: 'Domain-context calibration mitigates all three types of label biases holistically and significantly improves the in-context learning performance.' This suggests that integrating context-specific information helps reduce multiple forms of biases simultaneously, leading to enhanced model performance in practical scenarios.\n\nThe consistent use of terms like 'content-free text,' 'random in-domain words,' and 'domain-context calibration' throughout the slides reinforces the methodology proposed to address and rectify label biases effectively.\n\nThe visual elements include graphs comparing performance metrics under different conditions, reinforcing the message about the benefits of domain-context calibration.

The main content area features a detailed explanation of how this approach works:

1. **Code Generation Process**:
   - It starts with a discussion about the challenges faced when using natural language descriptions to generate operations.
   - A specific example is provided where a user asks, "Can you call model.fit()?" This question aims to clarify if calling `model.fit()` should include the data augmentation step (`model.fit(X_train, y_train, class_weight=class_weights, verbose=0, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), shuffle=True)` as part of the process.
   - Another clarifying question follows: "Can you call model.predict(X_test)?"
   - An example of the generated code snippet is shown, which includes the necessary details such as the model, input data (`X_test`), target labels (`y_test`), and other parameters like `verbose`, `validation_data`, and `shuffle`.

2. **Clarification Question Analysis**:
   - The slide explains that asking clarification questions helps identify key operations needed for better code generation.
   - It emphasizes that aligned operations provide more specifications than those obtained without clarification.
   - The slide notes that aligning operations can help ensure desired outputs but highlights the challenge posed by certain operations not included in the confusion matrix.

3. **Challenges and Hypothesis**:
   - The text mentions that training with oracle CQs leads to ground truth predictions close to real operations, especially at argument-level specifications.
   - However, it points out that the top 5 ranked CQs do not include calls of confusion matrix functions, suggesting they need further clarification.
   - To address these issues, the hypothesis is proposed that asking clarifying questions will improve code generation accuracy.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The conclusion reiterates that while the task involves aligning operations closely with real operations, only differences at the argument-level specifications matter.
   - The hypothesis supported by results above suggests focusing on clarifications to enhance alignment between predicted and actual operations.
