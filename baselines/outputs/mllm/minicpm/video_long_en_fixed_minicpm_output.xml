By integrating such detailed statistical analyses, the creators aim to provide robust evidence backing their assertions, thereby bolstering trustworthiness and scholarly integrity throughout the delivered content.\n\nThe presentation moves forward with a slide introducing 'Active Learning Strategies: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy.' At the center, a thought bubble humorously notes, 'Rare class annotation – "needle in a haystack."' This light-hearted commentary succinctly encapsulates the inherent challenges associated with identifying minority groups within large-scale datasets.\n\nBelow this humorous remark, a detailed explanation outlines the benefits of employing probability-of-rare-class strategies. Key points emphasize that these approaches substantially reduce the need for manual labeling of rare classes, which often constitutes merely 0.1% of the total data volume. This reduction translates to fewer required labelings, leading to enhanced efficiency in processing massive amounts of information.\n\nThe slide compares traditional random sampling methods with the proposed probabilistic strategies, showcasing how the latter can achieve similar accuracy rates but require far less effort. Random sampling would necessitate manually labeling nearly half of the data (49%), whereas the probability-of-rare-class technique requires only 0.1%, resulting in a drastic decrease in workload.\n\nTo further clarify this distinction, the slide lists several metrics derived from a study conducted by Vasudha Varadarajan et al., published in the proceedings of the First Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) in June 2009. The study evaluates five different strategies: 'Random,' 'AL-Random,' 'AL-Entropy,' 'AL-CoreSet,' 'AL-CAL,' and 'AL-PRC.'\n\nThe comparison spans four different evaluation measures: 'AUC,' 'Accuracy,' 'Precision,' and 'Recall.' Each measure reflects the performance improvements brought forth by adopting probability-of-rare-class strategies. For instance, the AUC metric demonstrates substantial gains ranging from +0.17 to +0.23, reflecting improved discrimination capabilities in rare-class scenarios.\n\nThe slide also mentions that the probability-of-rare-class strategies were tested using a dataset called 'TREC-9,' which comprises news articles annotated with political events. This particular corpus was selected because many events appeared infrequently, embodying classic cases of rarity. The dataset included approximately 2 million sentences, though most contained common terms rather than rare occurrences, accentuating the necessity for efficient annotation methods in managing such infrequent entities.\n\nThe presentation continues with a detailed breakdown of the performance enhancements achieved through applying probability-of-rare-class strategies. The slide enumerates various evaluation metrics, including 'AUC,' 'Accuracy,' 'Precision,' 'Recall,' 'F1 Score,' and 'ROC-AUC.' Each column represents a different experimental condition or algorithmic approach evaluated in the study.\n\nThe first row lists the baseline measurement ('Baseline: from scratch'), establishing a benchmark for comparison. Subsequent rows correspond to different strategies: 'Random,' 'AL-Random,' 'AL-Entropy,' 'AL-CoreSet,' 'AL-CAL,' and 'AL-PRC.'\n\nThe metrics reveal notable improvements facilitated by these advanced strategies. For example, 'AL-PRC' exhibits the greatest enhancement, achieving an increase of approximately +0.21 in the ROC-AUC metric. This improvement signifies a considerable leap in discriminative power, allowing the system to distinguish between positive and negative classes more accurately.\n\nThe slide also includes a brief comment on the left side, stating, 'Minimum annotation cost = 0.1% of data size.' This assertion underscores the efficiency gained by utilizing probability-of-rare-class strategies, as opposed to random sampling, which would demand much higher annotation costs.\n\nThe detailed enumeration of these metrics and comments provides a comprehensive view of the study's findings, substantiating the superiority of probability-of-rare-class approaches in rare-class annotation tasks. The meticulous presentation style ensures clarity and ease of understanding, crucial for disseminating sophisticated analytics to a broad audience.\n\nThe slide concludes with the authorship acknowledgment: 'Eddie/Madison Varadarajan,' credited for the creation of the visualization. This attribution lends authenticity and recognition to the contributors responsible for crafting the insightful graphic representation.\n\nThe presentation proceeds with a slide titled 'Active Learning Strategies: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy.' Central to this slide is a diagram illustrating the core idea of finding rare classes akin to locating a needle in a haystack. The diagram shows a large pile of hay representing numerous ordinary items, with a single needle symbolizing the rare item sought.\n\nThe diagram uses arrows and speech bubbles to depict the search process. One arrow leads from the haystack to a magnified region, zooming in on the needle. Speech bubbles near the haystack contain phrases like 'I know that cigarettes kill me' and 'I grabbed a couple smokes after the meeting today,' representing thoughts or actions related to recognizing and reacting to rare events or situations.\n\nBelow the diagram, a horizontal axis plots 'Area under the ROC curve (AUC)' against 'number of samples.' Different colored lines represent varying strategies or models. The red line starts high, gradually decreasing, eventually reaching zero, indicative of the baseline model's performance. The blue line fluctuates mid-range, denoting moderate performance. Finally, the green line rises sharply, peaking at the highest point, signifying exceptional performance attributed to the probability-of-rare-class strategy.\n\nThe slide credits the source of the visual aid: 'Eddie/Madison Varadarajan,' affirming the creator(s) of the illustrated concept. This credit adds a layer of accountability and recognition to the depicted innovation.\n\nThe combination of visual metaphors and quantitative data effectively conveys the complexity of identifying rare classes amid overwhelming data volumes. It bridges the gap between theoretical constructs and tangible realities faced in applied fields requiring precise event detection and anomaly recognition.\n\nThe presentation continues with a slide titled 'Active Learning Strategies: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy.' The centerpiece of this slide showcases a detailed diagram that vividly illustrates the analogy of searching for rare classes within a large dataset, likened to finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nThe diagram prominently features a large mound of hay, symbolizing the majority of commonplace data points. Amidst this haystack lies a singular needle, representing the rare class that needs to be identified. Arrows guide the viewer’s eye from the haystack to a magnified zone, zooming in on the needle. Two speech bubbles accompany this imagery, echoing sentiments like 'I know that cigarettes kill me' and 'I grabbed a couple smokes after the meeting today,' capturing everyday experiences tied to the notion of recognizing and responding to uncommon events or behaviors.\n\nBelow this central illustration, a horizontal axis plots 'Area under the ROC curve (AUC)' against 'number of samples.' Various colored lines denote different strategic approaches or models. The red line commences high, descending steadily until hitting zero, mirroring the baseline model's ineffectiveness. Midway, a fluctuating blue line marks intermediate performance levels. Concluding the spectrum, a steeply ascending green line peaks dramatically, epitomizing the superior capability offered by the probability-of-rare-class strategy.\n\nThe slide attributes the creative visualization to Eddie/Madison Varadarajan, ensuring proper acknowledgment of intellectual contributions. This acknowledgment bolsters the presentation's credibility and acknowledges the innovative spirit driving the development of such pedagogical tools.\n\nThe presentation progresses seamlessly, delving deeply into the operational nuances of active learning strategies tailored for rare-class annotation. Throughout the preceding slides, a coherent thread of exploring how these strategies optimize the balance between annotation demands and predictive accuracies has been maintained, leveraging robust statistical evaluations and relatable analogies to communicate complex theories effectively.\n\nThe utilization of colorful graphs, concise metrics, and illustrative diagrams throughout ensures that the intricacies of active learning principles resonate with learners, rendering accessible pathways toward grasping advanced methodologies pivotal for navigating rare-class anomalies in diverse data-driven disciplines.\n\nThe presentation advances with a slide titled 'Active Learning Strategies: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy.'

The main title of the presentation is 'Transfer and Active Learning for Annotating Rare Class.' It lists several authors: Vasudha Varadarajan, Swetha Muthukrishnan, Vasundhara Vatsyayan, Xiaoyu Liang, Matthew Wexler, Jonah Bresler, and H. Andrew Schwartz. A reference to a paper by Vasudha Varadarajan et al., published in 2019 at ACL-IJCNLP, is provided.\n\nThe first slide transitions into another frame showing a diagram explaining rare class annotation as difficult due to its rarity, akin to finding a needle in a haystack. This difficulty increases when annotated manually but can be alleviated through transfer learning methods like PRC (Probabilistic Random Class). The slide emphasizes that active learning strategies are crucial for annotating rare classes effectively.\n\nThe next segment introduces 'Cold-start AL with transfer learning,' detailing how initial models retain information during training. It explains the iterative process where new examples are added iteratively after each iteration. The slide highlights three types of annotations: Cumulative (CM), Out-of-domain: Iterative (OoD: I), and In-domain: Cumulative (Ic). It compares these approaches using a flowchart depicting model updates over iterations.\n\nA bar chart illustrates the performance differences between various annotation strategies under different conditions. The cumulative strategy shows varying effectiveness across different scenarios labeled as 'Random,' 'Entropy,' 'CoreSet,' 'CAL,' and 'PRC.'\n\nThe final part of this section discusses cold-start active learning with transfer learning, emphasizing the efficiency and simplicity of the PRC method. It provides visual representations comparing the cumulative approach versus iterative out-of-domain (OoD) and in-domain (Ic) strategies.\n\nThe narrative continues with a detailed explanation of the 'Active Learning: Cumulative vs Iterative Update' strategy. It describes how models update sequentially based on new data additions. The slide contrasts two approaches: OoD: Iterative and Ic: Cumulative. The iterative approach involves updating models incrementally with new data, while the cumulative approach integrates all data cumulatively before updating. Visual aids include diagrams illustrating model states \(M_0\) transitioning to \(M_1\), then to \(M_2\) and \(M_3\).\n\nThe slide also includes QR codes linking to code, datasets, and papers related to the topic.

    <sample id="207">The video begins with a title slide that reads 'ACL 2023' in bold white letters on a blue background, accompanied by the Google logo. The presentation transitions to another slide titled 'Prompting for Translation,' which includes an image of palm trees and text discussing recent test sets used to assess PaLM capabilities. Key points include: - Recent test sets (e.g., WMT19) are not designed for evaluating translation quality. - PaLM's performance is compared against SOTA systems like Google Translate. - Experimental results indicate that example quality is more important than similarity to source sentences. Specialized SOTA systems have significant advantages over PaLM, especially close to Google Translate. Insights from MQM show that fluency of PaLM is comparable to SOTA but accuracy scores generally lower, dominated by "Accuracy/Omission." Style/awkwardness issues persist, making them less favorable for PaLM. A detailed breakdown follows, emphasizing these findings throughout multiple slides.</sample>
    <sample id="208">The slide titled 'Step 2: Marked Words' provides a detailed analysis of the percentages for Black and White personas, with specific words like 'basketball,' 'loud,' 'attitude,' 'athletic,' 'tall,' and others highlighted. It emphasizes that these marked groups differ from unmarked groups through their portrayal in language models GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. The text highlights the importance of transparency about bias mitigation to ensure fairness in AI-generated responses.</sample>
    <sample id="209">The slide titled 'Constrained Language Planning' introduces the concept of generating specific goals for a cake-making task. It details how to generate these goals using InstructGPT via in-context learning, with examples like 'Make a chocolate cake,' 'Make it pink,' and 'Make it for a wedding.' The text explains that smaller language models fine-tuned on Coscript can produce higher quality scripts than larger LLMs when given more complex tasks.

The section labeled 'Method' outlines three steps: 1) Generate specific goals; 2) Over-generate candidate scripts; 3) Filter scripts based on constraints. This method is described as post-hoc re-ranking, where Coscript inherits from an abstract one with extra constraints.

The next part discusses limitations and future work, noting that improving LLMs requires a post-hoc approach due to their inability to handle multiple goals simultaneously. A diagram illustrates this by showing two candidates (A and B), both having the same goal but different plans, indicating the need for filtering through constraints.

The final segment emphasizes evaluating the planning ability of LLMs over generated scripts filtered through constraints. An example shows how to filter out irrelevant information ('...don't put anything else on top of the cake') while keeping relevant parts ('...add strawberries on top'). Another example highlights adding cocoa powder instead of sugar, demonstrating how constraints help focus on essential elements.

The presentation concludes with slides discussing script distillation techniques, accuracy comparisons among various models, and the advantages of using Coscript for constrained language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="292">The video begins with a title slide displaying the text 'DEPLAIN: A German Parallel Corpus for Sentence Simplification' in bold black letters on a white background. Below this, there is additional information indicating that it was presented at ACL 2023 by Regina Stodden, Omar Momem, and Laura Kallmeyer from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany. The presentation appears to be part of an academic or research conference.\n\nNext, another title slide introduces 'Text Simplification' as one of the topics covered in the presentation. It includes three categories: Simplicity, LexSimp, and StructSimp, each represented by different colors (blue, red, and yellow). These categories are further broken down into specific metrics such as F1, BLEU, P, R, and F1. Examples include 'LHA-SIMPL' with scores like 94.67, 58.44, 0.66, 780.0, and 'CATS-G3C' with similar metric values. This section provides detailed evaluation criteria used in the study.\n\nFollowing this, a more detailed breakdown shows examples like 'VecAlign' with scores ranging from 204 to 365 across various metrics. Other entries include 'BERTAlign' with scores between 467 and 504, and 'MASSAlign' with scores varying from 846 to 1046. Each entry has associated descriptions explaining their methodologies or approaches, providing a comprehensive view of the experimental setup and results.\n\nThe focus then shifts to automatic alignment methods using DEPLAIN-APA and DEPLAIN-WEB. Scores under these headings range from 0.5 to over 1.0 for both APA and WEB tests. Descriptions explain how these alignments were achieved through features like substitution, clause deletion, reordering, word deletion, insertion, and others. Metrics listed include F1, BLEU, P, R, and F1. The table compares performance across different datasets, offering insights into the effectiveness of these alignment techniques.\n\nThe final segment presents tables comparing document-level and sentence-level simplification performances. For document-level simplification, metrics include F1, BLEU, P, R, and F1. Entries show high scores like 94.67, 58.44, 0.66, 780.0 for LHA-SIMPL, and lower but still significant scores for other methods like CATS-G3C. For sentence-level simplification, metrics again include F1, BLEU, P, R, and F1.

    <sample id="295">The name of the speaker is Adam Przepiorkowski.</sample>
    <sample id="296">The slide titled 'EPIC: ENGLISH PERSPECTIVIST IRONY CORPUS' introduces the EPIC project, which aims to annotate irony from multiple perspectives. It highlights that irony is a complex phenomenon and presents an annotation process involving 15 annotators for each of the seven varieties (United Kingdom, Australia, India, United States, Germany, France, Ireland). The slide emphasizes the importance of multi-perspective approaches in understanding human knowledge encoding through irony.\n\nThe next section discusses the challenges faced by annotators due to self-declared gender differences across countries. It mentions that annotators have to annotate instances from all language varieties, not just their native one. This is followed by detailed information on the distribution of irony annotations among different perspective sets, including examples like 'If ur homeless you probably wouldn't have a phone,' 'Today is my fifth anniversary with my girlfriend,' and 'Means it's been twenty years since I've had a handkerchief.'\n\nThe slide then provides visual representations using violin plots to show the distribution of irony annotations based on various dimensions such as gender, ethnicity, age group, nationality, student status, employment status, and country. These plots illustrate how irony perception varies significantly between these groups.\n\nThe final part of the presentation compares gold test set F1-scores against perspective-based test set F1-scores. It notes improvements in performance when using perspective-aware models over non-perspective standard models. Additionally, it explains that perspective-aware models tend to make decisions with less uncertainty and are more confident about their assessments within specific context sets representative of their perspective. A table shows detailed F1-scores and percentage changes across different demographic categories, highlighting significant improvements in certain areas while indicating some declines in others.\n\nThe last segment reiterates the advantages of perspective-aware models in handling irony detection tasks effectively.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The presentation slide titled 'Dogwhistles' features a dog whistle icon and the text 'Cosmopolitan is a dogwhistle for 'cosmopolitan elite.' The slide explains that these terms are used to convey coded messages without explicitly stating controversial ideas, with examples like 'cosmopolitan,' 'globalist,' or 'internationalist.' It emphasizes how such language can evade content moderation systems. The slide includes a table comparing different types of labels (dogwhistle, slur, standard) across categories like racist, antisemitic, transphobic, etc., showing their toxicity scores when rated by various models.\n\nThe next section discusses evaluating dogwhistle recognition in language models using GPT-3. It mentions that 45% of sentences containing dogwhistles were identified as toxic, while slurs received lower toxicity ratings due to being more explicit. Examples include 'tax relief' and 'patriotism.'\n\nThe final part highlights the importance of understanding how dogwhistles work within political discourse. It shows an example where Josh Hawley's statement about "cosmopolitan elites" is analyzed through a typology &amp; glossary from HateCheck. The slide provides definitions for various groups labeled as dogwhistles, including Jewish, Black, inner-city welfare queen, cosmopolitan elite, anti-Semitic, and others, emphasizing the need for context to understand the true meaning behind these words.\n\nThe project aims to create a typology and glossary rich in contextual information, conduct case studies on historical U.S. political speeches, evaluate dogwhistle recognition in language models, and show how dogwhistles evade content moderation. This comprehensive approach helps identify and analyze coded rhetoric effectively.\n\nThe detailed analysis continues with specific examples of dogwhistles, highlighting phrases like 'cosmopolitan,' 'anti-Asian,' 'anti-Semitic,' 'transphobic,' 'anti-black,' 'white supremacist,' 'Islamophobic,' 'climate change denier,' 'racist,' and 'patriotism.' These examples illustrate how seemingly benign terminology can be coded to convey controversial or discriminatory sentiments.\n\nThe slide also introduces the concept of 'Shared culture symbols,' which refers to shared cultural references often associated with hate speech. Examples provided include 'Wonder-working power,' 'Adult human female,' and 'Hate culture.' These elements help explain how certain phrases might appear innocuous but carry underlying negative connotations intended to provoke opposition among particular groups.\n\nThe explanation further delves into the differences between formal and informal registers of dogwhistles. Formal register dogwhistles refer to structured expressions commonly found in official documents or statements, whereas informal register dogwhistles are typically used in everyday conversation or casual writing. This distinction aids in recognizing the varied contexts in which dogwhistles operate.\n\nThe slide concludes with a call to action: 'This project needs your help!' encouraging viewers to contribute to the research effort. It lists several ways people can assist, including donating via PayPal, becoming a patron on Patreon, contributing data, reviewing literature, testing code, translating materials, attending workshops, presenting at conferences, and participating in discussions. The goal is to build a robust dataset and develop effective tools for identifying and combating dogwhistles in modern communication.\n\nThe slide then transitions to a new topic focused on 'Toxicity detection with dogwhistles.' It presents a bar chart comparing the performance of three different approaches: no dogwhistles, only dogwhistles, and both together. The x-axis categorizes the results based on term type ('racist,' 'antisemitic,' 'transphobic,' 'anti-black,' 'white supremacist,' and 'Islamophobic'), while the y-axis represents the toxicity score percentages ranging from 0 to 100%. The bars indicate the effectiveness of each method in detecting toxicity, with clear distinctions visible across different term types.\n\nThe slide elaborates on the findings, noting that GPT-3 surfaces around 20% of 'informal/online' dogwhistles for all persona types combined. Among these, approximately 69% belong to the 'formal' category. Additionally, it points out that dogwhistles have low recall rates for transphobic personas, suggesting potential issues related to recency or domain effects in training data.\n\nThe narrative underscores the complexity involved in accurately detecting dogwhistles, especially those embedded in online conversations. It suggests that future improvements could benefit from incorporating more diverse datasets and addressing limitations inherent in current methodologies.\n\nThe slide maintains its focus on explaining the challenges faced during this phase of the study, providing insights into the methodology employed to address these complexities. It serves as a crucial step towards developing reliable mechanisms for identifying and mitigating harmful rhetoric in digital communications.\n\nThe slide titled 'Typology &amp; Glossary' reiterates the objectives of creating a typology and glossary enriched with contextual information. It showcases four key components essential to the project: \n\n1. Typology &amp; Glossary with Rich Contextual Information - Represented by an image of a book.
2. Case Study of Historical U.S. Political Speeches - Illustrated with an image of a person speaking into a microphone.
3. Evaluate Dogwhistle Recognition in Language Models - Depicted by an image of a computer screen displaying code.
4. Show How Dogwhistles Evade Content Moderation - Accompanied by an image of a character with a mask and crossed-out eyes.

The slide emphasizes the ongoing efforts to improve the identification and mitigation strategies against dogwhistles in contemporary discourse.</sample>
    <sample id="298">The slide titled 'Named Entity Recognition &amp; Generalization' introduces the topic with a white background and gold text. It includes two bullet points: 'Model architecture' and 'Larger model size.' The Georgia Tech logo is visible in the bottom right corner, maintaining consistency throughout the presentation.\n\nNext, the slide transitions to discussing temporal drift as a cause of performance loss. A graph shows F1 scores over time for various models on CoNLL-2003 and CoNLL++ datasets from 2004 to 2022. The graph highlights trends such as Flair, BERT-base, and RoBERTa-large, indicating their performance changes over time. The title remains consistent with the previous slides.\n\nThe discussion continues with an additional point about adaptive overfitting not being observed. This adds context to the reasons behind performance drops due to temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting. The graph still illustrates the F1 scores for different models across years.\n\nThe final part of this segment reiterates that "Performance drop is caused by: Temporal drift" and poses the question "Do CoNLL-2003 taggers still work?" emphasizing the ongoing relevance of these taggers despite the challenges posed by temporal drift.\n\nThe next section begins with a new slide under the heading 'Conclusion,' which lists key takeaways including better model architecture, larger model size, more fine-tuning examples, and no diminishing returns or observed adaptation issues. The conclusion emphasizes the need for continuous improvement and adaptability in NER systems.\n\nThe slide then addresses whether CoNLL-2003 taggers are still effective today. It concludes affirmatively with the word 'YES!' written prominently in large blue letters against a light brown circular shape, reinforcing the effectiveness of these taggers even after nearly three decades since they were developed.\n\nFinally, the last slide provides references and contact information related to the study presented. It displays URLs for the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09747), dataset (https://github.com/ShuhengL/ac2023_conllpp), and email address (sliu775@gatech.edu) in bold blue font.
