    <sample id="30">The video provides a comprehensive overview of the 'LLM-BLENDER' framework, emphasizing its role in ensemble learning for LLMs. It highlights the importance of ranking candidates and fusing outputs to achieve optimal performance across various models. The presentation includes detailed explanations of the evaluation metrics used (BLEU, Pearson Correlation, Spearman's Rank Correlation) and showcases the effectiveness of different sub-modules like 'PairRanker' and 'GenFuser'. The consistent use of visual aids such as charts, tables, and logos helps convey complex information clearly, making it easier for viewers to understand the methodology and results of the research presented.</sample>
    <sample id="31">The slide titled 'Revisiting Minimal Pair Paradigm' discusses the evaluation of language models using minimal pairs in different contexts. It includes a table with sentences from three datasets: BLIMP, SyntaxGym, and Crows. The sentences are perturbed to test their acceptability or unacceptability. Two example sentences are shown: 'A rose was there.' and 'A rose is there now.' The slide also mentions that these evaluations involve matched structures up to 900 tokens long.\n\nThe next section explains why matched prefixes affect LM judgements by showing how context length raises or lowers judgement performance for MPPs. A graph illustrates the impact on model performance as input length increases, comparing different prefix types (None, Prefix/suffix advs, Long prefix adv, Add clause, All). The graph shows how model sensitivity changes based on the presence of prefixes like "However" and "Since." The text emphasizes that matched prefixes most severely affect model performance when they preserve syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences.\n\nThe final part highlights the importance of understanding how matched prefixes influence model judgments through perturbed sentences. Sentences include: 'What could Jessica before seeing those spotlights?' and 'What did Aaron have just said about cleaning the museum?' These examples illustrate how matched prefixes can significantly alter the acceptability of sentences within certain contexts.\n\nThe presentation continues with an explanation of how matched prefixes most severely affect model judgments due to preserved syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. This affects model performances as input lengths increase. The graph compares different prefix types (None, Prefix/suffix advs, Long prefix adv, Add clause, All) against acceptability scores. Sentences such as 'What could Jessica before seeing those spotlights?' and 'What did Aaron have just said about cleaning the museum?' demonstrate the effect of matched prefixes. The conclusion reiterates the key takeaway: Language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences, and MPP evaluations do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge.\n\nThe detailed analysis concludes with a note emphasizing the need for better methods to evaluate language models under short, single-sentence inputs, highlighting the limitations of current approaches and suggesting improvements in evaluating models' ability to understand complex linguistic structures.\n\nThe slide then transitions into a new topic titled 'Why do matched prefixes affect LM judgements?' It elaborates on the reasons behind this phenomenon, explaining that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. The second bullet point states that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge, indicating a gap in current evaluation methodologies.\n\nThe following sections provide visual representations of the concepts discussed. A graph labeled 'Perturbation' displays various lines representing different conditions over time, likely illustrating how model performance varies with different perturbations. Below the graph, two sets of candidate prefixes are listed along with their corresponding acceptability scores, providing quantitative data supporting the textual explanations above.\n\nThe bottom portion of the slide contains a diagram depicting the space of candidate prefixes, including both Early Verbs and Adjectives categories. Each category has multiple subcategories represented by colored dots, which might indicate different variations or instances of each type. The diagram helps visualize the complexity and variety involved in testing matched prefixes within language models.\n\nOverall, the slide provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced in evaluating language models' judgment abilities regarding matched prefixes, supported by graphical data and detailed textual explanations.\n\nThe slide titled 'Why do matched prefixes affect LM judgements?' presents several key points and observations about the behavior of language models when exposed to matched prefixes. Here's a detailed breakdown of the content:

1. **Language Models are Sensitive to Latent Syntactic/Semantic Features Shared Across Sentences**:
   - This statement suggests that language models tend to be influenced by underlying structural and semantic elements present throughout the sentences being analyzed.

2. **MPP Evaluations with Short, Single-Sentence Inputs Do Not Fully Capture LMs' Abstract Knowledge**:
   - This indicates that while language models may perform well on individual sentences, their overall comprehension and abstraction capabilities cannot be accurately assessed solely through brief, isolated tests.
   - Perturbations of sentences show varying levels of acceptability, demonstrating the nuanced effects of matched prefixes on model judgments.

3. **Models Are Robustly Affected by Matched Prefixes**:
   - The robustness refers to how consistently matched prefixes impact the model's ability to judge sentence acceptability.
   - Examples provided include sentences like 'A rose was there.' and 'A rose is there now.' These exemplify how matched prefixes change the perceived correctness of sentences depending on contextual cues.

4. **Graphical Representation of Model Performance**:
   - A graph plots the relationship between prefix type and acceptability scores, showcasing how different prefixes ('None', 'Prefix/suffix advs', 'Long prefix adv', 'Add clause', 'All') influence model judgments at increasing lengths of input text (up to 900 tokens).
   - Specific sentences used for demonstration purposes highlight the practical application of these findings.

5. **Detailed Analysis of Perturbed Sentences**:
   - Sentences such as 'What could Jessica before seeing those spotlights?' and 'What did Aaron have just said about cleaning the museum?' illustrate the specific impacts of matched prefixes on model judgments.
   - These examples underscore how context-specific features contribute to the accuracy of the model's assessments.

6. **Key Takeaways**:
   - Emphasizes the necessity for improved evaluation strategies capable of capturing more intricate aspects of language models' cognitive processes.
   - Highlights ongoing research efforts focused on developing advanced metrics and techniques to enhance the comprehensiveness of model evaluations.

7. **Visual Diagrams**:
   - A diagram depicts the space of candidate prefixes, categorizing them into early verbs, adjectives, and other types.
   - This aids in visually distinguishing the diverse configurations tested during experiments.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarizes the main insights derived from the study, stressing the critical role of matched prefixes in shaping language model judgments.
   - Reinforces the idea that future developments should aim to refine existing methods for achieving more accurate and insightful evaluations of language models.

In summary, the slide offers a thorough exploration of the complexities surrounding matched prefixes and their profound implications on language model judgments, supported by empirical evidence and conceptual diagrams.</sample>

    <sample id="80">The slide titled 'Background' details the process of watermark injection, including defining a target embedding, counting trigger words in sentences, and adding them to the original embedding. It also explains how these steps ensure that the watermark is covertly embedded while maintaining utility for downstream tasks like classification accuracy (ACC) and detection performance metrics such as Δcos1, Δt2, and p-value. The settings include parameters m = 20, n = 4, and frequency interval = [0.005, 0.01]. The slide emphasizes the importance of verifying whether the extracted embeddings match the expected ones using metrics like Δcos1, Δt2, and p-value. A table compares different methods across four datasets: AG News, Enron Spam, MIND, and SST2, showing their ACC values and corresponding detection performance metrics. Finally, it includes visualizations of embeddings from various sources, highlighting differences between the provider's service and other models or methods used throughout the study.</sample>

The title is in blue text, and there are two bullet points below it: 'green - orange: Cross-shot setting, transfer learning can significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target NLs.' and 'blue - orange: Multilingual LLMs (CodeX &amp; Bloom) are still inadequate for crosslingual semantic parsing tasks.'</sample>
    <sample id="82">The presentation slide titled 'Unsupervised Automated Essay Scoring' introduces a novel framework for unsupervised automated essay scoring. It discusses the limitations of current methods, which rely on large labeled corpora and manual annotation, highlighting that these approaches are time-consuming and labor-intensive. The proposed method aims to address these challenges by introducing multiple heuristic quality signals as pseudo-ground truth scores without requiring ground truth annotations.

The core idea is encapsulated in the acronym ULRA (Unsupervised Learning from Rank Aggregation), which aggregates partial-order knowledge contained in various heuristic quality signals such as Quality Scores, Quality Signals (Propositions), and Quality Signals (Ratings).

    <sample id="227">The presentation slide titled 'Pangu Framework' is displayed, featuring a green box with the text 'Goals: Allow LM's to focus on discrimination' and an image of two individuals in red puffer jackets. The main content includes various charts comparing different models like Pangu (BERT-base), ArcaneQA, UnifiedSKG (T5-base), and GPT-3 across tasks such as GrailQA, GraphQ, and WebSPQ. A key message emphasizes that directly generating plans may not be optimal for using LMs for grounded language understanding.</sample>
    <sample id="228">The slide titled 'Background' introduces the concept of watermark injection in large language models (LLMs) and embedding-based backdoors. It explains that watermarks are injected into embeddings to protect intellectual property, with a focus on ensuring covertness and transferability while maintaining utility for downstream tasks like classification accuracy.\n\nThe next section is labeled 'Watermark injection,' detailing the process where a target embedding is modified by adding a backdoor weight to create an original embedding. This involves selecting trigger words from a dataset, calculating their frequency using cosine similarity, and normalizing them to ensure covertness. The example provided uses the AdaBoost algorithm as a reference point.\n\nThe following part discusses copyright verification through the construction of a backdoor and benign dataset, highlighting the need to request embeddings from a stealer's service and verify extracted features against these datasets. A table compares different methods across four datasets: AG News, Enron Spam, MIND, and SST2, showing metrics such as accuracy (ACC), detection performance (Δcosine, Δbackdoor, Δcovertness, Δcovertness2, Δp-value), and embedding visualization plots illustrate the distribution of embeddings after watermark injection.\n\nThe final segment focuses on experimental results, presenting tables comparing various methods based on accuracy (ACC), detection performance (Δcosine, Δbackdoor, Δcovertness, Δcovertness2, Δp-value), and embedding visualizations. The slides conclude with acknowledgments to Microsoft Research Asia, collaborators, and sources used throughout the presentation.\n\nThe last frame displays the text 'Thanks!' indicating the conclusion of the presentation or lecture series.</sample>
    <sample id="229">The presentation slide titled 'Introduction' introduces the topic of revisions in argumentative writing. It explains that revisions are essential to achieve optimal phrasing and emphasizes their persuasive impact on audiences.\n\nThe slide presents three versions of a claim: 'Cell phone radiation causes brain cancer,' with the second version clarifying it as 'Cell phone radiation may cause brain cancer.' The third version suggests an alternative, more nuanced statement: 'Cell phone radiation should not be considered a primary cause of brain cancer.'\n\nThe slide then transitions into two main sections: 'Representativity and Reliability' and 'Contextuality.' Under 'Representativity and Reliability,' it discusses how revision-based data can effectively support tasks like suboptimal-claim detection. It also highlights the importance of modeling the distance between different claim versions for these purposes. Additionally, it notes that contextual information is crucial but task- and quality-dependent.\n\nThe final section lists various claims such as 'Should abortion be legal?' and 'Should pineapple belong on pizza?' These examples illustrate the complexity of determining whether certain statements require revisions based on context and reliability.\n\nThe bottom part of the slide provides code and data links (https://github.com/wisdey/ACL-23) and includes a QR code for easy access to additional resources.\n\nThe presenter appears intermittently throughout the slides, likely providing explanations or further details during the presentation.\n\nThe next slide features the title 'Challenges' at the top left corner. Below this, there is a detailed list under the heading 'What can be found in the paper?'\n\nThe first bullet point reads: 'A detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of strategies tackling each challenge.'\n\nThe second bullet point states: 'A systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced tasks.'\n\nThe third bullet point mentions: 'Revision-based data can be employed effectively for the given tasks.'\n\nThe fourth bullet point adds: 'Modeling the distance between the two claim versions is beneficial for suboptimal-claim detection.'\n\nThe fifth bullet point notes: 'Impact of contextual information is task- and quality-dependent.'\n\nAt the bottom of the slide, there is a URL link (https://github.com/wisdey/ACL-23/) and a QR code for accessing additional materials.\n\nThe overall content focuses on summarizing key findings from the research presented in the paper, emphasizing the challenges faced and addressed through detailed analyses, comparisons, and practical applications using revision-based data and contextual considerations.\n\nThe following slide continues the summary theme with the title 'Summary' prominently displayed at the top left corner. The subtitle asks, 'What can be found in the paper?' This indicates a continuation from the previous slide's discussion on challenges.\n\nThe slide is divided into four main sections: 'Analysis and Experiments,' 'Select(ion) Findings,' 'Code and Data,' and 'Topical and User Bias.'\n\nUnder 'Analysis and Experiments,' it elaborates on the thorough examination of methods used to tackle challenges within the study. It specifies that a comprehensive investigation was conducted to understand the effectiveness of various strategies in addressing specific issues raised in the paper.\n\nThe 'Select(ion) Findings' section outlines significant observations derived from the selection process. Key points include the effective use of revision-based data for supporting tasks related to the introduction of new concepts. It also mentions the benefits of modeling the differences between varying claim versions, which aids in detecting suboptimal claims. Furthermore, it underscores that the influence of contextual information varies depending on the nature of the task and its quality.\n\nThe last section, 'Code and Data,' directs viewers to a GitHub repository where they can find all relevant files and datasets associated with the project.

    <sample id="237">The slide titled 'KITMUS Test Suite' introduces the concept of integrating pretrain-time and inference-time knowledge. It explains that NLU models can draw on two types of knowledge: entity-specific information, which is available at both training (pretrain) time and during inference; and fictional background knowledge, which only becomes accessible after task-specific training. The slide emphasizes the importance of task-specific training for effective knowledge integration in language understanding tasks.\n\nThe presentation continues with a detailed explanation under the heading 'Variants of KITMUS.' This section outlines three main takeaways about how many models struggle to reason over multiple sources of knowledge due to their inability to integrate pretrain-time and inference-time knowledge effectively. Task-specific training is highlighted as necessary for successful knowledge integration, but it also poses challenges such as difficulties in integrating inference-time background knowledge into models. A specific example illustrates these concepts by showing how different models perform when presented with various scenarios involving fictional entities like 'Chichester,' demonstrating varying levels of accuracy across different datasets or evaluation metrics.\n\nThe conclusion reiterates key points from previous slides, emphasizing the need for model developers to consider both pretrain-time and inference-time knowledge to improve performance. It provides practical guidance by directing viewers to find the dataset, generation &amp; evaluation code on GitHub at 'poems/kitmus.'\n\nThe final part of the presentation includes a call to action for further engagement, encouraging viewers to follow the project's social media accounts ('@KITMUS') and subscribe to updates via email or RSS feed. Additionally, there are links provided for more resources related to the KITMUS test suite, including an interactive demo and other relevant materials.</sample>

    <sample id="337">The video starts with a white background and the text 'Model Feasibility' in bold, orange letters at the top. Below this title, there are two sections: 'Agglutinative Language' on the left and 'Fusional Language' on the right. The section for Agglutinative Language contains detailed descriptions about how words form by stringing morphemes together directly, making it easy to explore word formation (Japanese or Korean). The Fusional Language section explains that words form by morphemes which are usually linked together but can be difficult to process due to reasonable segmentation of words (English). At the bottom, under the Conclusion section, it states that the graph structure of WRG in GRM can cope with various complex word formations, while the application effectiveness of GRM to other languages depends on the rationality of word decomposition only.\n\nThe scene transitions smoothly as the same content is displayed consistently throughout multiple frames, maintaining focus on the textual information provided. There are no additional visual elements introduced during these segments, ensuring clarity and continuity in conveying the message regarding model feasibility for different linguistic structures.\n\nThe presentation continues with the same layout and content, emphasizing the comparison between agglutinative and fusional language forms. It highlights the structural differences and their implications for word processing and application effectiveness across languages.\n\nThe final segment shows a transition from the previous slides to a new slide titled 'Thank you for listening!' in large, brown letters against a plain white background. This indicates the conclusion of the presentation, expressing gratitude to the audience for their attention. In the lower-right corner, part of an individual's face appears, adding a personal touch to the closing remarks.\n\nThe frame maintains consistency with minimal changes except for the addition of logos at the top-left corner, including the ACL 2023 logo and the logo of 中山大学 (Sun Yat-sen University). These details reinforce the context of the conference and the presenting institution, providing a formal closure to the presentation series.\n\nThe sequence concludes with the same 'Thank you for listening!' message, reinforcing the end of the presentation session.</sample>
    <sample id="338">The presentation slide titled 'Towards Objective Evaluation of Human Natural Language Explanations' introduces the topic and presents a structured outline. It begins with an introduction to human natural language explanations, discussing their evaluation through various metrics like BLEU and ROUGE.

    <sample id="353">The slide titled 'Dataset Creation' provides an overview of the process, including a code snippet for generating CQs. It highlights that the approach focuses on aligning operations with NLD and refers to experiments with selected models.\n\nThe next section is labeled 'Pipeline Results,' which discusses the challenges in identifying key operations for better generated code. The text explains that aligned operations provide more specifications but are challenging due to missing arguments. It also mentions that clarifying these operations helps generate better-quality outputs. The hypothesis supported by results above suggests that training with oracle CQAs leads to ground truth predictions close to actual ones, especially at operation-level specifications.\n\nThe final part of this segment includes tables showing recall metrics for different models (PLBART, CodeT5-top, and CodeT5-bottom) across various datasets (NLD, micro, macro). These tables highlight differences between recalled vs. referred CQAs and mention that the pipeline underperforms compared to confusion matrix methods like AdaBoostClassifier and cross_val_score. The hypothesis about alignment based on clarification on operations is strongly supported by the results shown above.\n\nThe presentation then transitions into a new topic: 'Is clarified key operations the reason for better generated code?' This question is answered affirmatively, as indicated by a green checkmark. The explanation provided states that intuitions about clarifying key operations lead to improved code generation, particularly when using oracles. The detailed analysis shows that training with oracle CQAs closely matches the ground truth, although only operations at argument-level specifications differ from actual ones. The challenge lies in the top 5 ranked CQs not including calls to confusion matrices but instead relying on clarifications. However, it emphasizes that the task remains difficult despite efforts to clarify operations.\n\nThe slide concludes with two bullet points summarizing the findings:
1. Training with oracle CQAs leads to ground truth predictions close to the true ground, except for operations at argument-level specifications.
2. Clarifying these operations aids in generating closer-to-ground-truth outcomes.

Additionally, there is a note stating that the hypothesis was supported by results shown above, indicating that while clarifying operations improves prediction accuracy, the overall performance still lags behind confusion matrix-based methods such as AdaBoostClassifier and cross_val_score. The model performances show significant improvements with the use of clarifications, though they remain lower than those achieved through confusion matrices.\n\nThe slide features logos from TUM, TU Darmstadt's Computer Science Department, and the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS), along with their respective web addresses.
