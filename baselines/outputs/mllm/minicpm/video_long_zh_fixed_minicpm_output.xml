    <sample id="161">The slide titled 'Language Planning' introduces the concept of distilling knowledge from large language models for constrained script planning. It begins with a step-by-step process: 1. Generate specific goals with InstructGPT via in-context learning, which results in 55,000 scripts with constraints based on CoScript. 2. Over-generate candidate scripts and filter them using an LLM (InstructGPT) to select those that are faithful to the constraint. 3. Annotate these filtered scripts manually by comparing them against the original abstracts.

The title is displayed in bold black text on a white background, accompanied by the university's logo featuring a stylized head silhouette and the words 'Human Language Analysis Beings.' Below this, there are two names listed: Vasudha Varadarajan and Matthew Maloney.\n\nThe next frame introduces the topic of cognitive dissonance detection using transfer learning. It features an illustration of two stick figures facing each other with speech bubbles containing the word 'Disagreement,' set against a simple background. A small inset image shows a haystack with a needle labeled 'Rare class annotation – "needle in a haystack."' The main content area includes a diagram explaining the process of model training and retraining, highlighting iterative and cumulative strategies. Text within the diagram reads 'Initial model: Transfer Learning' and 'Model Retrain/Update,' indicating the steps involved in annotating rare classes through active learning methods.\n\nThe following frames delve into the details of these strategies. One frame presents a flowchart illustrating the initial model training phase followed by an iterative update cycle involving new data. Another frame provides a detailed table comparing different active learning strategies (Random, Entropy, CoreSet, CAL, PRC) based on their performance metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), time taken, and subjective differences. Bullet points summarize key findings about minimum annotation cost and difficulty levels related to cognitive dissonance detection.\n\nThe narrative continues with another section discussing cold-start active learning approaches. This part highlights three types of models: M0, M1, and M2, depicted in a network structure format. Two diagrams illustrate out-of-domain and in-domain scenarios, showing how models iteratively train and retrain over multiple iterations. These sections emphasize the efficiency and simplicity of PRC strategy compared to others like Random, Entropy, CoreSet, and CAL.\n\nThe final segment focuses on takeaways from the study. Three QR codes provide links to code, dataset, and paper resources. Contact information for the researchers is also provided, along with acknowledgments to previous work by Vasudha Varadarajan et al., Swearingen et al., and Hsu et al. The presentation concludes with a thank you note, expressing gratitude to the audience.\n\nThe last few slides show contact information and references to the source material used in the research. The first slide displays contact emails for Vasudha Varadarajan (vvradarajan@cs.stonybrook.edu), Swetha Jhunjhnuwala (sjhuhng@cs.stonybrook.edu), and Hasim S. Kocak (hasim.kocak@cs.stonybrook.edu). Below the email addresses, it states that the materials can be found at 'https://github.com/vvaradarajan/rare-class-AL,' 'https://github.com/swjhuang/rare-class-AL,' and 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02590,' respectively.\n\nThe second slide contains three QR codes corresponding to the aforementioned GitHub repositories and arXiv link. Each QR code has accompanying labels: 'Code: https://github.com/vvaradarajan/rare-class-AL,' 'Dataset: https://github.com/swjhuang/rare-class-AL/dataset,' and 'Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02590.'\n\nThe third slide repeats the same contact information and resource links but adds additional context regarding the nature of the annotations. It mentions that minimal annotation costs do not necessarily lead to better models due to difficulties in accurately annotating rare classes. The slide emphasizes that increasing the number of examples does not improve prediction quality significantly because most rare instances cannot be annotated correctly. It suggests that cognitive dissonance is one instance where accurate annotation might still pose challenges.\n\nThe fourth slide summarizes the limitations faced during the annotation process. It notes that while adding more examples helps increase the chance of correct annotations, it may not always result in improved predictive accuracy. The slide underscores the complexities encountered when dealing with rare class annotations, particularly in cases like cognitive dissonance.\n\nThe fifth slide transitions smoothly into a conclusion or summary section. It starts with a header reading 'Active Learning: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy,' which sets up the discussion on effective strategies for handling rare class samples in machine learning tasks.\n\nThe sixth slide maintains the focus on probability-of-rare-class strategies. At the top center, there is a visual metaphor depicting a haystack with a needle, symbolizing the challenge of identifying rare class annotations among many similar ones. To the right of this imagery, a caption explains, 'Rare class annotation – "needle in a haystack."' Below this explanation, there is a dotted line connecting various elements representing different aspects of the annotation process.\n\nThe seventh slide elaborates further on the concept. On the left side, under the heading 'Acquisition strategy,' it lists several options including 'random,' 'entire,' 'core-set,' 'cal,' and 'prc.' Adjacent to this list, there is a highlighted statement emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate acquisition strategies. The central portion of the slide illustrates the relationship between the chosen strategy and its impact on annotation outcomes. Arrows point towards a box labeled 'New examples' and back to the 'Acquisition strategy,' demonstrating how selected strategies influence the addition of new data samples.\n\nThe eighth slide continues to explain the selection of acquisition strategies. In the middle of the slide, there is a large red arrow pointing downwards from the phrase 'New examples' to a blue rectangle labeled 'Annotation.' This indicates the step where newly acquired examples are processed for annotation. Above this, there is a smaller green arrow pointing upwards from the label 'Annotation' to the term 'New examples,' suggesting a cyclical process where annotated results feed back into acquiring new data.\n\nThe ninth slide reinforces the cyclic nature of the annotation process. It depicts arrows forming a loop starting from 'Annotation' leading to 'New examples' and then looping back to 'Annotation.' Additionally, there is a horizontal bar graph below this circular motion, displaying four bars labeled 'Random,' 'Entire,' 'CoreSet,' and 'PRC.' The y-axis represents the metric 'AUC' ranging from 0.48 to 0.75, and the x-axis categorizes them as 'Random,' 'Entire,' 'CoreSet,' and 'PRC.' The values associated with each bar range from approximately 0.53 to 0.64, providing quantitative insights into the effectiveness of different sampling strategies.\n\nThe tenth slide shifts slightly in perspective, maintaining the emphasis on the cyclic process of annotation. It now incorporates a larger graphical representation of the haystack and needle analogy, reinforcing the ongoing theme of rare class annotation challenges. The layout remains consistent with the previous slide, ensuring clarity and continuity in presenting the complex concepts discussed throughout the series.\n\nThe eleventh slide revisits the active learning framework for annotating rare classes.

The slide credits Vasudha Varadarajan at Stony Brook University, aligning with her earlier presentations.\n\nThe core element of the slide is a comprehensive diagram detailing the active learning workflow. Starting from the bottom left corner, the diagram outlines the sequence of actions required for the annotation process. It begins with a rectangular block labeled 'Train,' connected via arrows to subsequent stages denoted as 'M0,' 'M1,' and so forth, extending to 'M3.' This sequential progression visually represents the iterative refinement of the model through successive updates.\n\nIn the upper half of the diagram, a cloud-like shape filled with snowflake icons signifies the random sampling component essential for generating diverse data inputs. Adjacent to this icon, a dashed outline encloses the entire process, encapsulating all phases from initial training to final iteration. Within this enclosed space, the terms 'Initial model: Transfer Learning' and 'Model Retrain/Update' highlight the foundational techniques employed in this method.\n\nThe lower section of the diagram breaks down the interaction between human annotators and the model. It uses arrows to depict the dynamic exchange of new examples identified through the annotation process. Human annotators contribute fresh data, which feeds back into the system, facilitating continuous improvement and adaptation of the model. This cyclical feedback mechanism ensures that the model progressively learns from the anomalies detected during the annotation stage.\n\nThroughout the slide, clear labeling and directional arrows effectively communicate the structured methodology behind the active learning framework. Key phrases such as 'cold-start AL with transfer learning,' 'initial model: Transfer Learning,' and 'model retrain/update' underscore the critical components of the strategy. The overall design aims to offer a thorough understanding of how the proposed method leverages both initial transfer learning and adaptive updating mechanisms to tackle the annotation of rare classes efficiently.\n\nThe twelfth slide continues to elaborate on the active learning framework for annotating rare classes.

It showcases a detailed flowchart that compares the processes of iterative and cumulative active learning methodologies.\n\nAt the top center, a prominent graphic illustrates the transition from difficult-to-annotate items to easier-to-annotate items. The graphic resembles a haystack with a needle, symbolizing the challenge of identifying rare class annotations amidst numerous similar entries. Surrounding this visualization, explanatory text clarifies the dynamics of annotation difficulty across different stages.\n\nBelow the graphic, a chart divides the activities into distinct categories: 'Out-of-Domain: Iterative' and 'In-Domain: Cumulative.' This division highlights the difference in processing strategies depending on whether the annotations fall outside or inside the domain of known patterns. The iterative approach involves gradually refining the model through repeated cycles, whereas the cumulative strategy accumulates knowledge incrementally over time.\n\nThe slide utilizes arrows to indicate the flow of operations, moving from the introduction of new data ('Add new examples') to the application of the learned model ('Model Retrain/Update'). These arrows guide viewers through the logical progression of enhancing the model's capabilities based on accumulated experiences.\n\nThe primary colors used in the graphics—green for the iterative path and orange for the cumulative path—help differentiate between the two strategies clearly. Green circles mark significant events such as 'Add new examples' and 'Model Retrain/Update,' underscoring pivotal moments in the annotation process.\n\nThe slide serves as an educational tool, breaking down the complexities of managing rare class annotations into understandable segments. By contrasting iterative and cumulative strategies, it offers insight into choosing suitable methods tailored to varying annotation needs and contexts. The use of intuitive visuals aids comprehension, making abstract concepts accessible to learners and practitioners engaged in active learning frameworks.\n\nThe fourteenth slide continues to build upon the previous discussions, focusing on the practical implementation of the active learning framework for annotating rare classes.

The subtitle 'Cold-start AL with transfer learning' appears directly beneath the main title, indicating the specific approach being described. The slide credits Vasudha Varadarajan at Stony Brook University, aligning with her earlier presentations.\n\nThe core element of the slide is a detailed comparative analysis presented in a tabular format. The table is divided into columns labeled 'Rare %,' 'Time (s),' and 'Subj. diff.' Rows represent different sampling strategies: 'Random,' 'Entire,' 'CoreSet,' 'CAL,' and 'PRC.'\n\nThe 'Rare %' column ranges from 0% to 3%, reflecting the proportion of rare class samples considered in each scenario. The 'Time (s)' column records the average time spent per example, measured in seconds. Values vary widely, with some rows recording times around 0.50 seconds and others reaching nearly 1 minute, showcasing the variability in annotation speed dependent on sample rarity.\n\nThe 'Subj. diff.' column quantifies the subjectivity difference introduced during the annotation process. Values here span from -0.05 to +0.21, indicating the degree of deviation from perfect agreement among annotators. Negative values suggest less discrepancy, implying closer alignment, while positive values denote greater disagreement, highlighting potential challenges in achieving consensus among annotators.\n\nThe slide employs color coding to distinguish between negative, neutral, and positive subjective differences, aiding quick visual interpretation. For instance, rows marked with negative values (-0.05, -0.01, etc.) signify relatively minor discrepancies, whereas those with positive values (+0.21, +0.07, etc.) reflect higher levels of inconsistency.\n\nThe inclusion of a citation at the bottom left corner cites 'V.

    <sample id="190">The video begins with a title slide displaying the text 'Are You Copying My Model?' in bold, black letters on a white background. The presentation is associated with Microsoft and Sony AI, as indicated by their logos at the bottom of the slide. Following this, another title slide appears with the text 'Are You Copying My Model? Protecting Large Language Models via Backdoor Watermarks' along with additional details such as 'Applicable to EaaS,' 'Utility: Transferability,' and 'Covert: Covert,' all accompanied by respective icons (a shield for protection, an arrow pointing right for transferability, and a key for covertness. Below these descriptions are references to various papers related to watermarking techniques.\n\nNext, a detailed explanation under the heading 'Background' outlines how attackers may extract model parameters through embeddings provided by embedding services like OpenAI's GPT-3 API or Google's Cloud Text AI. It emphasizes that large language models excel in natural language understanding tasks but can be vulnerable if their parameters are extracted from embeddings. This section also discusses challenges faced when protecting intellectual property against reverse engineering attacks using backdoor watermarks. A specific example involving StolenEncoder is mentioned, highlighting its ability to extract embeddings from service providers without degradation in performance metrics while maintaining high accuracy and detection rates.\n\nThe focus then shifts to 'Motivation,' detailing why it is essential to protect copyright in embedded language models used for NLP applications. It explains that attackers might steal the model during training by learning from embeddings generated by other users. To address this issue, the concept of backdoor watermarks is introduced as a method to ensure the integrity of copyrighted data within pre-trained language models. The slide highlights three main points: 1) Attackers may steal the model through embeddings; 2) Need to protect copyright; 3) Detect whether a provider's service has been stolen by others. An illustration shows a trigger set being injected into a provider's model, which generates backdoor watermarks detectable only after fine-tuning the model. These watermarks allow the original owner to identify unauthorized use of their model.\n\nFollowing this, the slide transitions to 'Existing Works,' presenting a table comparing different methods across four datasets: AG News, Enron Spam, MIND, and SST2. Metrics include Accuracy (ACC), Detection Performance (\(\Delta_{acc}\), \(\Delta_{w}\), and p-value. For each dataset, several methods are compared, showing varying levels of accuracy and detection performance. For instance, Original methods achieve around 90% ACC, whereas EmbMarker methods show significant improvements, especially for Enron Spam, where \(\Delta_{acc}\) ranges from -6.75 to +4.82, indicating enhanced robustness against theft.\n\nThe narrative continues with a detailed breakdown of the experimental results under the heading 'Experimental Results.' Four plots labeled (a) AG News, (b) Enron Spam, (c) MIND, and (d) SST2 illustrate the embedding visualizations corresponding to each dataset. Each plot displays blue dots representing the embeddings, with red dots marking specific target embeddings. The x-axis represents one dimension of the embeddings, ranging approximately between -0.2 and 0.2, while the y-axis spans roughly from -0.2 to 0.2. Red dots indicate the positions of targeted embeddings, providing a clear visualization of how well the proposed method preserves the original structure despite potential alterations due to backdoor watermarks.\n\nThe final segment features a static image with the word 'Thanks!' displayed prominently in the center of the frame.

    <sample id="194">The video begins with a white background and the text 'NLP' in large black letters, which then changes to 'NLPPositionality'. The scene transitions to a slide titled 'NLPPositionality: Characterizing Design Biases of NLP Models', listing authors Sebastian Santy from the University of Washington, Carlota Corredera from the Allen Institute for AI, and Claire Cardie from Carnegie Mellon University. It continues with another title slide reading 'NLPPositionality: A framework for characterizing design biases in natural language processing models,' followed by an introduction to Carlota Corredera's presentation on this topic at ACL 2019.\n\nCarlota Corredera introduces herself as part of the research team that developed the concept of positionality in NLP datasets and models. She explains how these concepts can be applied more broadly beyond NLP, including social media analysis and recommender systems. The discussion emphasizes understanding positionalities within different contexts like political discourse or online advertising, highlighting their importance across various domains.\n\nThe focus shifts back to addressing positionalities in NLP through the lens of perspectivism.

    <sample id="249">The slide titled 'Revisiting Minimal Pair Paradigm' introduces the concept of minimal pairs in language model evaluations, explaining how these pairs are used to assess acceptable and unacceptable sentences. The slide includes a table with three columns labeled 'BLIMP,' 'SyntaxGym,' and 'Crows,' each containing examples of sentences that illustrate different syntactic structures or adverbs. It also mentions that the evaluation is performed on sentences with matched structure but varying prefixes.\n\nThe next section discusses why matched prefixes affect LM judgments, emphasizing that models are sensitive to perturbed sentences within certain prefix lengths (125M to 6.7B). A graph shows the impact of prefix length on accuracy across various types of candidate prefixes: None, Prefix/adv, Prefix/adv/sent, Add clause, Add clause/sent, Wiki, and Unmatched. The graph indicates that the performance varies depending on the specific prefix type and its position relative to other elements like adverbs or clauses.\n\nThe final part of this segment focuses on the sensitivity of language models to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. It highlights that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge, as shown by the graph comparing P&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;(|P| &gt; ?) vs. P&lt;sub&gt;LM&lt;/sub&gt;(|P| &gt; ?). This suggests that while models can be robust against certain perturbations, they may still struggle with capturing more complex linguistic patterns when only considering individual sentence inputs.\n\nThe key takeaways emphasize two main points:
1. Language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences.
2. MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge.

These insights underscore the limitations of current methods in evaluating language models and highlight the need for more comprehensive approaches that consider broader contextual relationships between sentences.\n\nThe presentation continues with another slide focusing on the importance of context length in evaluating language models. The title reads 'Why do MPP judgements vary with context length?' indicating an exploration into how the judgment outcomes change based on the amount of context provided. The slide explains that the performance of language models changes significantly from around 40 tokens up to about 300-400 tokens, suggesting a critical point where longer contexts start affecting model behavior differently. It then transitions to discussing why matched prefixes matter most severely affect model performance, particularly highlighting the sensitivity of language models to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. The text elaborates that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs fail to capture LMs' abstract knowledge effectively.\n\nA detailed explanation follows, mentioning that early work showed models were insensitive to perturbed sentences at lower token counts (&lt; 100), whereas recent studies indicate significant differences starting from approximately 40 tokens. The discussion emphasizes the necessity of using long contexts to accurately evaluate language models' understanding of syntax and semantics.\n\nThe slide concludes with a summary stating that models exhibit strong sensitivity to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. Additionally, it notes that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge. To further illustrate this point, the slide presents a graph showing the impact of prefix length on accuracy across various types of candidate prefixes such as None, Prefix/adv, Prefix/adv/sent, Add clause, Add clause/sent, Wiki, and Unmatched. Each curve represents a different prefix strategy, demonstrating how the model's performance varies with increasing context length. For instance, the 'None' category starts high but declines sharply after 40 tokens, while others show similar trends. This visual representation underscores the conclusion that models rely heavily on extended context to make accurate judgments about sentence acceptability and unacceptability.\n\nThe slide ends with a note on the importance of matching prefixes, which affects model predictions, especially those involving latent syntactic/semantic features. Examples include sentences like "What could Jessica before seeing the spotlights?" and "Who had Aaron saw the cleaning the museum?" These examples demonstrate how the presence or absence of specific prefixes influences the model's ability to judge whether a sentence is acceptable or unacceptable. The overall message reinforces the idea that extensive context is crucial for evaluating language models comprehensively.\n\nThe following slide begins with the heading 'Why do MPP judgements vary with context length?' This question sets the stage for exploring the reasons behind variations in Minimum Parity Pair (MPP) judgments due to differing levels of context provided. Below the heading, there is a detailed explanation that states: 'Language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences.' This statement underlines the primary reason for the variability observed in MPP judgments; namely, the sensitivity of language models to underlying syntactic and semantic structures present throughout multiple sentences.\n\nThe slide goes on to elaborate on the implications of this sensitivity. It clarifies that 'MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge.' This means that relying solely on brief excerpts does not provide a complete picture of what language models understand because they depend on recognizing recurring patterns and meanings spread out over several sentences rather than isolated phrases or words.\n\nTo visually represent this concept, the slide incorporates a graph illustrating the relationship between prefix length and accuracy across various types of candidate prefixes. The x-axis denotes the length of the input sequence, ranging from less than 100 tokens to values extending beyond 400 tokens. Different curves correspond to distinct prefix strategies including None, Prefix/adv, Prefix/adv/sent, Add clause, Add clause/sent, Wiki, and Unmatched. As expected, the graphs display fluctuations in accuracy corresponding to increases in context length, confirming that shorter sequences yield higher accuracies initially until reaching a threshold (~40 tokens) beyond which longer contexts begin to deteriorate performance. However, some strategies maintain relatively stable performances even as context extends past this limit, pointing towards scenarios where additional information might lead to ambiguous interpretations or misjudgments.\n\nThe bottom portion of the slide reiterates the significance of matched prefixes through their influence on model judgments. Sentences exemplifying varied syntactic structures or adverbs are listed under categories like BLIMP, SyntaxGym, Crows, and Wiki. An example sentence highlighted here is 'A rose was woody perennialing the spotlights,' showcasing how the inclusion or exclusion of specific prefixes alters the perceived correctness of the model’s output.\n\nIn essence, this slide encapsulates the core argument—highlighting both the technical challenges posed by limited context during model evaluations and stressing the necessity of incorporating sufficient contextual data to achieve reliable assessments of language proficiency.\n\nThe subsequent slide delves deeper into the topic presented earlier, maintaining focus on the theme of evaluating language models' sensitivity to context length and the role of matched prefixes. The header remains consistent with the previous slides, reading 'Why do MPP judgements vary with context length?' This continuity ensures clarity for viewers transitioning smoothly from one piece of content to another.\n\nThe central body of the slide provides a thorough analysis of the phenomenon being explored. Key points reiterated include the insensitivity of language models to perturbed sentences below 100 tokens and the emergence of significant differences in performance once the context reaches roughly 40 tokens upwards to approximately 300-400 tokens. This range marks a pivotal area wherein prolonged textual segments substantially alter model behavior, underscoring the essential nature of utilizing extensive context to gauge language capabilities accurately.\n\nAdditionally, the slide stresses the paramount importance of matched prefixes concerning model predictions. It illustrates how the existence or absence of particular prefixes profoundly impacts the assessment of sentence acceptability versus unacceptability. Examples given encompass queries like 'What could Jessica before seeing the spotlights?' and 'Who had Aaron saw the cleaning the museum?' These instances exemplify how the model's judgment hinges critically upon the integration of specific grammatical components within larger structural frameworks.\n\nThe concluding remarks summarize the findings succinctly, asserting that models exhibit heightened sensitivity to latent syntactic/semantic attributes dispersed uniformly across sentences. Moreover, it asserts that MPP evaluations confined strictly to singular sentence inputs fall short of encapsulating LMs’ overarching comprehension abilities. This assertion aligns perfectly with prior discussions, reinforcing the notion that substantial context is indispensable for effective language model evaluations.\n\nAs a graphical illustration complements the narrative, depicting the efficacy of diverse prefix configurations vis-à-vis the span of context utilized. Various lines trace the alterations in predictive accuracy contingent on the chosen prefix methodologies. Notably, the 'None' line commences high yet experiences a steep decline post-40 tokens, echoing observations made previously regarding the pronounced effect of increased contextual breadth on model performance. Other trajectories reveal comparable shifts, affirming the consistency of results derived from extensive data coverage. This visualization serves as a testament to the vital interplay among context length, matched prefixes, and overall linguistic comprehension, culminating in a coherent depiction of how these factors collaboratively shape the judgmental acumen exhibited by language models.\n\nThe slide maintains coherence with preceding sections by continuing the discourse initiated earlier. The header again poses the query, 'Why do MPP judgements vary with context length?' This persistent inquiry anchors the ongoing investigation into the dynamic interplay between context provision and model judgments.\n\nThe central body of the slide offers a meticulous elucidation on the intricacies involved. It reiterates that 'Language models are sensitive to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences.' This declaration reaffirms the foundational insight—that models respond adeptly to recurring syntactic and semantic elements distributed evenly throughout multiple sentences, marking them as integral to successful evaluative processes.\n\nFurthermore, the slide accentuates the critical aspect of matched prefixes influencing model judgments. Instances featuring various syntactic constructs or adverbs are cataloged under headings like BLIMP, SyntaxGym, Crows, and Wiki. Specific sentences, e.g., 'A rose was woody perennialing the spotlights,' serve illustrative purposes, demonstrating how the incorporation or omission of specified prefixes modifies the model's determination of sentence validity.\n\nAn illustrative graph is included, charting the ramifications of prefix length on accuracy metrics spanning numerous kinds of candidate prefixes: None, Prefix/adv, Prefix/adv/sent, Add clause, Add clause/sent, Wiki, and Unmatched. Each trajectory delineates the degree of precision accorded to respective prefix strategies. For instance, the 'None' series initiates prominently but plummets markedly above 40 tokens, indicative of diminishing effectiveness associated with reduced context. Conversely, other pathways portray steadier profiles, signifying resilience amidst extended data spans. This graphic substantiates the overarching thesis that models gravitate heavily toward lengthy contexts to ascertain precise judgments regarding sentence acceptability and unacceptability.\n\nThe slide finishes off with a remark on the relevance of matching prefixes impacting model predictions. It specifies how the presence or absence of specific prefixes modulates the model's capacity to render judgments pertaining to sentence acceptability or unacceptability. The accompanying examples—'What could Jessica before seeing the spotlights?' and 'Who had Aaron saw the cleaning the museum?'—demonstrate the operational influence of these prefixes on the model's verdicts. The entirety of the communication underscores the necessity of ample context for achieving exhaustive appraisals of language models.\n\nThe very last frame of the video contains no new information compared to the second-to-last frame. It repeats the same details without introducing any fresh visuals or texts, ensuring continuity and reinforcement of the discussed concepts regarding the effects of context length and matched prefixes on language model judgments.\n\nThe entire presentation thus cohesively integrates all facets, from initial inquiries probing the variances induced by context length to intricate analyses explicating the profound implications of matched prefixes, culminating in a unified stance advocating for expansive contextual consideration to fortify language model evaluations.</sample>

    <sample id="264">The presentation slide titled 'TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation' from Zhejiang University introduces a method for audio-visual text generation. It begins with an introduction to the motivation behind TAVT, highlighting that while existing methods can generate text descriptions of visual content, they often fail in transferability across different domains due to domain shifts and multimodal differences. The slide explains how TAVT addresses these issues by aligning audio and video features through a unified auditory-visual semantic space.\n\nThe next section details the methodology used in TAVT. It includes diagrams illustrating the alignment process between audio and visual modalities using the Unified Auditory-Visual Meta-Mapper (UAVMM) network. This involves mapping audio features to visual features within a shared latent space. The UAVMM is trained via contrastive learning loss functions, which help in maintaining consistency among modality clusters during training.\n\nThe slide then transitions into explaining counterfactual contrastive learning as part of the method's approach. Counterfactual contrastive learning helps maintain modality consistency throughout the model's lifecycle. It also describes the use of a unified auditory-visual encoder and language model generator (UAVEMG) to map audio features to visual features in this shared latent space.\n\nFollowing this, the slide provides detailed mathematical expressions related to the counterfactual contrastive learning algorithm. These include equations like \( \alpha_{t} = \sigma(W_t [MHA(A_t, V_t]) \) and \( \beta_{t} = \sigma(W_t [MHA(A_t, V_t]) \), along with other parameters such as \( \theta \) and \( \phi \). It emphasizes the importance of these components in ensuring consistent feature representation across both audio and visual modalities.\n\nThe final sections focus on performance comparisons and ablation studies. A table compares two tasks—text-to-image translation and image-to-text translation—across various datasets. Another table presents results from ablation studies about audio features and module differences, showcasing improvements when certain modules are included or excluded. The last frame expresses gratitude towards the audience, indicating the conclusion of the presentation.\n\nThe slide concludes with tables comparing the performance of TAVT against baseline models under cross-modality conditions. For instance, it shows metrics like BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr scores for translations from animation to music, animal to kids, etc., demonstrating significant improvements over baseline models.\n\nThe overall structure ensures clarity and thoroughness, making it easy for viewers to follow the technical details and understand the advancements made by TAVT in addressing challenges faced by previous methodologies.\n\nThe title 'Experiment' appears at the top left corner, followed by detailed explanations of the experiment setup and outcomes. The first sub-section labeled 'Counterfactual Contrastive Learning' discusses its role in maintaining modality consistency throughout the model's lifecycle. Mathematical notations and algorithms associated with counterfactual contrastive learning are presented, emphasizing their contributions to the method's effectiveness.\n\nThe second sub-section, 'Ablation Studies,' highlights the impact of including or excluding specific modules in the model. Two tables provide quantitative evidence supporting the claims made earlier. One table focuses on ablation studies about audio features, showing improved performance metrics compared to baselines without those features. The other table examines ablation studies about different modules, further validating the benefits of incorporating all elements into the model.\n\nThe third sub-section, 'Performance Comparisons Under Cross-modality Conditions,' showcases comparative results of TAVT versus baseline models.
