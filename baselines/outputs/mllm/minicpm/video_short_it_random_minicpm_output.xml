    <sample id="5">The image shows a slide from an educational presentation about text simplification. The title at the top reads "Text Simplification Example." Below this, there is a diagram that illustrates different methods of text simplification: Substitution, Clause Deletion, Reordering, and Word Deletion. These are represented by colored boxes (blue for Substitution, red for Clause Deletion, green for Reordering, and yellow for Word Deletion). There's also a section labeled "Plain Language" with an example sentence in German before and after simplification techniques have been applied to it. In the upper right corner of the image, there appears to be a small video feed showing someone speaking or presenting, likely related to the content being discussed on the slide.</sample>
    <sample id="6">The image shows a slide from an educational presentation about text simplification. The title of the slide is "Text Simplification Example" in English, and it includes both German and simplified language versions to illustrate how complex sentences can be made easier to understand through various techniques like substitution, clause deletion, reordering, word deletion, and insertion.</sample>
    <sample id="7">The image shows a slide from an educational presentation about text simplification. The title of the slide is "Text Simplification Example." Below this, there's a diagram illustrating different methods used in text simplification: substitution, clause deletion, reordering, word deletion, and insertion.

The original German sentence given as an example is: "Die Gewerkschaft setzt sich dafür ein, dass zum Beispiel höhere Löhne gezahlt werden." This translates to English as "The trade union advocates for higher wages being paid."

Below the original sentence, the simplified version (plain language) provided is: "Die Gewerkschaft setzt sich für höhere Löhne oder mehr Urlaub ein." In English, this means "The trade union advocates for higher wages or more vacation time."

The visual aids include arrows indicating how parts of the complex sentence are transformed into simpler forms through various techniques like substitution ("dass" replaced with "für"), clause deletion ("zum Beispiel" removed), and others highlighted by colored boxes corresponding to each method mentioned above.</sample>
    <sample id="8">The content of the slide is about "German Text Simplification Corpora" and includes a bar chart titled "Sentence Level." The chart shows data for different years, with labels such as "2013," "2014," "2015," "2016," "2017," "2018," "2019," and "2020." There are various colored bars representing different categories like "Domestic," "Health," "Education," "Economy," "Public affairs," etc. Specific values are indicated on some of the bars, including 483 (in black) and 756 (in orange). A legend explains these categories, but it's partially obscured in the image.</sample>

    <sample id="14">The image shows a slide from a presentation with two main sections. The left section is titled "Types of Simplification" and contains three bar charts labeled "news," "bible," and "L2." Each chart compares four different methods: Simplicity, LexSimp, StructSimp, and Simplicity (again). The right section is titled "Simplification Transformations" and features another set of bar charts comparing DEplain-apa and DEplain-web across various categories such as moving, engineering, lexical substitution, word addition, verb addition, and sentence deletion. In the top-right corner of the image, there is a small inset showing a person who appears to be presenting or discussing the content on the slides.</sample>
    <sample id="15">The image shows a slide with two charts. The first chart, titled "Types of Simplification," compares three types: Simplicity, LexSimp, and StructSimp across four categories: news (n=46), bible (n=155), L2 (n=157), and fiction (n=72). Each category has bars representing the different simplification methods.

The second chart is labeled "Simplification Transformations" and compares DEplain-apa and DEplain-web across six topics: moving, engineering, lexical substitution, addition, word order, and deletion. Both charts are accompanied by small images in the top right corner showing a person's face.</sample>
    <sample id="16">Types of Simplification Simplicity LexSimp StructSimp news n=46 bible n=155 L2 n=157 fiction n=72</sample>
    <sample id="17">The image contains two charts with the title 'Types of Simplification' on the left and 'Simplification Transformations' on the right. The chart on the left shows data for four categories: news, bible, L2, and fiction. Each category has three bars representing Simplicity (blue), LexSimp (red), and StructSimp (yellow). Below each bar is a sample size notation in parentheses, indicating n = 46 for news, n = 155 for bible, n = 157 for L2, and n = 72 for fiction.

The chart on the right displays different types of simplification transformations such as moving, engineering, lexical substitution, word addition, verb addition, and sentence deletion. It compares DEPlain-apa (blue) and DEPlain-web (green).

In the top-right corner of the image, there's a small inset showing someone wearing headphones, possibly engaged in an activity related to the presentation or analysis being displayed.</sample>
    <sample id="18">The content in the image is already presented in Italian. The title "Types of Simplification" and other text elements are written in Italian, including phrases like "Simplificità," "LexSimp," and "StructSimp."</sample>
    <sample id="19">The video begins with a slide titled '3. Use-cases' and the subtitle 'Automatic alignment and simplification.' The background is white, and there is a small inset in the top right corner showing a person wearing headphones. As the scene progresses, another individual appears in the same small inset window, now holding a mug.

The focus then shifts to a detailed table under the heading 'Automatic Alignment Evaluation,' which compares different methods of automatic alignment based on their performance metrics: precision (P), recall (R), F1 score (F1), and normalized mutual information (nMI). Each method's name and description are listed alongside these scores. The table includes entries such as LHA-LiSE, CATS-C3G, VecAlign, BERTAlign, and MASSAlign, each accompanied by specific numerical values for the evaluation metrics. This part of the presentation provides a comprehensive overview of various alignment methods and their effectiveness.

The final segment continues to display the detailed table from the previous frame, maintaining the headings and structure. It reiterates the comparison between 1:1 upper part results and ncm cpm results. The individuals remain visible in the small inset windows throughout this section, reinforcing the ongoing nature of the discussion or presentation about the use cases and evaluations related to automatic alignment techniques.</sample>

    <sample id="42">The slide is titled "Dependency Structure of Coordination." It discusses different approaches to analyzing dependency structures in coordination, such as Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies), Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London. Each approach uses the sentence "Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie" as an example. The presentation appears to be part of a conference or academic event related to computer science and linguistics.</sample>
    <sample id="43">The slide is titled "Dependency Structure of Coordination" and it appears to be part of a presentation on linguistic structures. It lists different approaches or models for understanding the coordination in sentences, specifically focusing on how actions are structured when multiple people are involved.

The main content includes four bullet points:
1. Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies): This point has an example sentence that reads: "Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie."
2. Chain/Moscow
3. Conjunction-headed/Prague
4. Multi-headed/London

Each approach seems to illustrate a different way to represent the dependencies between words in complex sentences involving more than one person performing the same action ("loves"). The examples provided show Homer as the subject loving three individuals named Lisa, Bart, and Maggie.

The layout suggests this might be from an academic lecture or educational material aimed at explaining syntactic concepts related to natural language processing or linguistics.</sample>

For example, with 16 task clusters (labeled "16+"), both maximum accuracy ("Max Acc") and sensitivity improve significantly compared to having fewer task clusters. However, beyond this point, further increases in task clusters do not result in significant improvements in either metric. This suggests that while adding more tasks can enhance model performance up to a certain limit, additional complexity might lead to diminishing returns on performance gains.</sample>

    <sample id="258">LabintheWild è una piattaforma che si occupa di sperimentazioni online convolvendo una grande varietà di volontari diversi e ricercatori. La piattaforma sembra coinvolgere gli utenti in attività sperimentali relative all'intelligenza artificiale, come determinare se un'AI è capace di discernere certe emozioni o valutare la frequenza con cui si utilizza la parola "hateful" in una frase.

La piattaforma ha registrato un totale di 5,376,396 partecipanti totali, come indicato da un contatore visivo. Gli utenti possono partecipare a sperimentazioni, come illustrato dalla scritta "Participate now!" (Partecipa ora!) associata a due pulsanti blu. Una delle sperimentazioni presenti è legata alla distinzione tra le percezioni umane e quelle dell'AI riguardo l'emotività, mentre un'altra riguarda la distinzione tra le percezioni umane e quelle dell'AI riguardo la frequentità con cui si usa la parola "hateful".

Inoltre, la piattaforma sembra coinvolgere anche gli investigatori, come evidenziato dalla scritta "Online experiment from researchers". Questo suggerisce che i ricercatori utilizzano la piattaforma per sperimentare e svolgere ricerche su come l'intelligenza artificiale comprende o non comprende certe aspetti della lingua umana.

    <sample id="310">The video presents a detailed framework for re-annotating datasets. It begins by showing that 300 instances are sampled from a dataset, each instance has an associated gold label, and these labels are then sent as part of a study on UTW (University of Washington). The process involves collecting data, processing it through model predictions, and analyzing the results based on demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, education level, country, etc.

The first step in this process is to "Re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators." This means ensuring that multiple people annotate the same set of data to increase accuracy and reduce bias. 

In the analysis phase, various demographic categories like Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Education, Country, and Income are considered. For example, within the 'Age' category, there's a breakdown into different ranges: Under 25 years old, Between 25 - 45 years old, and Over 45 years old. Each range shows the percentage of individuals who fall into those categories across all annotations made during the re-annotation process.

The second step outlined in the framework is to compare annotations by demographic to models and datasets via Pearson’s R scores. This comparison helps assess how well the annotated data matches or correlates with existing models and datasets. By using statistical measures like Pearson’s correlation coefficient, researchers can determine the strength and direction of linear relationships between variables, which aids in validating the quality and reliability of the annotated data.

Overall, the framework emphasizes thorough sampling, diverse annotation methods, careful consideration of demographic factors, and robust analytical techniques to ensure high-quality re-annotation of datasets.</sample>

    <sample id="360">Quello che causa il declino del performance?</sample>
    <sample id="361">The slide presents a discussion on the factors contributing to performance drop in machine learning models. The title "What Causes Performance Drop?" is prominently displayed at the top of the slide, setting the stage for an exploration into potential issues affecting model accuracy.

Below the main title, two key points are highlighted: "Adaptive overfitting?" and "Temporal drift?". These questions suggest that the presentation will delve into specific types of overfitting (adaptive) and changes in data distribution or relevance over time (temporal drift) as possible causes for decreased performance.

On the right side of the slide, there is a graph with axes labeled "CoNLL 2003 F1 Score" on the horizontal axis and "Test Set Accuracy" on the vertical axis. This graph likely illustrates how different approaches or methods perform under varying conditions, providing visual evidence supporting the textual content.

In the bottom left corner of the slide, there is a circular image of a person wearing glasses and a dark shirt, adding a personal touch to the professional context of the presentation. Additionally, the Georgia Tech logo appears in the bottom right corner, indicating the affiliation of the presenter or the source of the research being discussed.

Overall, the slide effectively combines text, imagery, and graphical data to convey complex information about performance drops in machine learning models, focusing particularly on adaptive overfitting and temporal drift as significant contributors.</sample>
    <sample id="362">Cosa causa una caduta del performance?</sample>
    <sample id="363">What Causes Performance Drop?

- Adaptive overfitting?
  - No diminishing returns
  - Not observed

- Temporal drift?</sample>
    <sample id="364">The slide discusses the reasons behind a performance drop in machine learning models. It lists three main factors: 1. Adaptive overfitting, which occurs when a model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization on new data. 2. No diminishing returns, indicating that further improvements in model complexity do not lead to significant gains in performance. 3. Temporal drift, where the distribution of data changes over time, causing the model's predictions to become less accurate as it fails to adapt to these changes. The table provides specific examples with CoNLL-2003 and CoNLL++ datasets, showing how different models perform under various conditions. The graph illustrates temporal drift by plotting performance metrics against time, highlighting how performance degrades with larger temporal gaps between training and testing periods.</sample>
    <sample id="365">The slide is titled "What Causes Performance Drop?" and it discusses two main factors: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. Under adaptive overfitting, the points mentioned are no diminishing returns, which has not been observed yet; under temporal drift, performance degrades with a larger temporal gap in time series forecasting models like CoNNL-2003 and CoNNL++ 2014. There's also a table showing different model names (Flair, Pooled Flair, ELMo) along with their respective scores on CoNNL-2003 and CoNNL++ 2014 datasets, as well as the percentage change (∆F1 (%) ). The chart plots performance against time from 2005 to 2018, indicating that performance generally improves or remains stable over time for most models.</sample>
    <sample id="366">Conclusion For a good generalization, we need: - Better model architecture - Larger model size - More fine-tuning examples</sample>
    <sample id="367">The slide contains a conclusion section with the following points: 1. For a good generalization, we need: - Better model architecture - Larger model size - More fine-tuning examples 2.

The Georgia Tech logo is visible at the bottom right corner of the slide.</sample>
    <sample id="368">The slide is titled "Conclusion" and contains a bulleted list of points. The first bullet point states, "For a good generalization, we need:" followed by sub-bullets listing: - Better model architecture - Larger model size - More fine-tuning examples The second bullet point reads, "Performance drop is caused by:" with two sub-points underneath: - Temporal drift - Not adaptive overfitting The third bullet question asks, "Do CoNLL-2003 taggers still work?" At the bottom right corner of the slide, there's an image of Georgia Tech's logo.</sample>
    <sample id="369">In the image, there is a graph showing performance trends over time. The x-axis represents different models or systems, including "Stanford NLP," "Illinois NER," "BILSTM-CNN-Charlie," and others. The y-axis shows some numerical values ranging from 75 to 100. There are two lines on the graph: one in blue labeled "CoNLL-2003" and another in orange labeled "CoNLL-2014++." These lines show how each model's performance has changed over time.

The slide also contains text discussing generalization needs for better models, mentioning factors like architecture, size, and examples. It questions whether CoNLL-2003 taggers still work today, with an emphatic "YES!" at the end.</sample>

La costruzione del set di dati di training utilizza 53 attività tratti da 9 gruppi per il training, con un campione di 10.000 istanze per attività. Per la costruzione del set di dati di testing, si riserva l'intero gruppo di ragionamento comune per il testing, seleziona ulteriormente 5 attività dal VQA e dal gruppo di attività non categorizzate, e tratta un campione casuale di 20 attività dal set di test della divisione dei Natural Instructions come nuove attività per il NLP.</sample>

    <sample id="913">La slide illustra il concetto del machine learning a supervisione debole. Inizia con la domanda "Why weakly supervised learning?" e spiega come la supervisione debole allevia il bottleneck dell'annotazione. Poi, spiega che i label debole sono "noisy" (rumori) e che memorizzazione del rumore danneggia la generalizzabilità. Infine, definisce il machine learning a supervisione debole (WSL) come il processo di addestramento di modelli che generalizzano bene anche se sono addestrati su dati rumori.</sample>

    <sample id="1022">The content is already in English, so there's no need for translation. It appears to be a presentation slide with the title "Don't Forget Your ABC's: Evaluating the State-of-the-Art in Chat-Oriented Dialogue Systems" and lists three authors at Emory University associated with their NLP Research Lab.</sample>

    <sample id="1024">The content of the slide is about "Comparative Evaluation." It features two groups of speech bubbles and icons representing a person and an AI assistant. The left side shows blue speech bubbles with white backgrounds, while the right side has purple speech bubbles with light gray backgrounds. Each group includes one icon of a person's head and three icons of AI assistants labeled "Alexa" in both sections.</sample>
    <sample id="1025">The video begins with a slide titled 'Comparative Evaluation' displayed at the top. The Emory University logo and an Alexa icon are visible in the bottom corners of the screen, indicating a collaboration between these entities. On the left side of the slide, there is a group represented by blue speech bubbles containing two characters, each accompanied by a robot-like figure labeled 'AI.' Similarly, on the right side, another group depicted by purple speech bubbles includes three characters alongside their respective robots labeled 'AI.' At the center bottom of the slide, an illustration of a judge holding a gavel appears, symbolizing evaluation or judgment.

As the scene progresses, the same title 'Comparative Evaluation' remains at the top, while the groups remain unchanged. However, new elements appear: a white circle to the left of the central judge image and a green checkmark below it, suggesting approval or correctness related to the evaluation process.

The focus then shifts to a different type of evaluation method called 'Likert Rating Evaluation,' as indicated by the updated title at the top of the next slide. This slide features the same judge character from previous slides but now holds both a gavel and a microphone, implying a more interactive form of assessment. Below this character, a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 is shown, representing a quantitative measurement tool for evaluating responses. Blue speech bubbles continue to represent communication among AI figures associated with the characters above them. In the background, the familiar logos of Emory University and Alexa are still present, maintaining consistency throughout the presentation.</sample>

    <sample id="1027">The image shows a slide from a presentation with the title "Likert Rating Evaluation" at the top. The slide includes an illustration of a person speaking to a robot, represented by blue speech bubbles and icons labeled "Alexa." Below this, there is a scale ranging from 1 to 5, with a green checkmark indicating a rating of 3. At the bottom left corner, there is an illustration of a judge holding a gavel and scales, symbolizing evaluation or judgment. In the background, logos for Emory University and Alexa are visible. Additionally, in the upper right corner, there is a small video feed showing a person wearing a light-colored shirt.</sample>
    <sample id="1028">The image shows a Likert scale used for evaluating the relevance of a bot's responses.

    <sample id="1035">Il contenuto in inglese è il seguente: 'Experiments' seguito da '4 Open-Domain Dialogue Models' e '100 Human-Bot Conversations per Model'.</sample>
    <sample id="1036">The video begins with a slide titled 'Experiments' in English, which details the use of 4 open-domain dialogue models and mentions that there are 100 human-bot conversations per model. The scene then transitions to another slide under the heading 'Baseline Evaluations'. This new slide is divided into three sections: Turn Likert, Dialogue Likert, and Comparative. Each section contains diagrams representing interactions between humans and bots, along with checkmarks indicating successful evaluations.

The narrative continues with further elaboration on the 'Baseline Evaluations' slide. Below each evaluation type (Turn Likert, Dialogue Likert, and Comparative), additional criteria for assessment are introduced through pink boxes labeled Consistency, Emotional Understanding, Informativeness, Overall Quality, Engagingness, Grammaticality, Proactivity, and Relevance. These criteria provide a more detailed framework for evaluating the quality of the bot interactions within the experiments.

The final part of the video maintains focus on the same 'Baseline Evaluations' slide, reinforcing the introduction of these eight specific criteria used to assess the quality of the bot interactions. Throughout this segment, Emory University's logo remains visible at the bottom left corner, while an Alexa logo appears at the bottom right corner, emphasizing the context of the experiment involving Amazon's virtual assistant technology.</sample>

    <sample id="1269">To understand why it is necessary to exchange tokens for the output sequence, we need to look at how the tags are associated with their respective words in the sentence. The image shows a process where each tag (like "the," "girl," and "slept") corresponds to specific parts of a sentence or phrase. By permuting these tokens, which means rearranging them, we can see that different arrangements lead to various outputs. This permutation helps in exploring all possible combinations and understanding how changes in token order affect the final result. Essentially, this approach allows us to analyze the impact of word arrangement on meaning and structure within the text.</sample>

    <sample id="1347">La dissonanza cognitiva è una teoria psicologica che descrive come la mente tende a minimizzare il disagio o il disagio causato da una incongruenza tra due o più elementi di cui si ha consapevolezza. Questo disagio, o dissonanza, può essere causato da differenze tra i propri pensieri, azioni o credenze. La teoria suggerisce che la mente cerca di ridurre questo disagio per raggiungere un equilibrio o una congruenza tra le informazioni cognitive diverse.</sample>

1. **Attacchi** 
   - I cyberricercatori potrebbero sottrarre il modello tramite l'apprendimento dai embeddings e fornire servizi simili.
   - StolenEncoder [1]

2. **Diritto d'autore**
   - È necessario proteggere il diritto d'autore dell'aspetto del servizio (EaaS).
   - Indetectare se un servizio fornito da un altro servizio è stato sottratto.

Il testo illustra la necessità di proteggere i diritti d'autore e di identificare eventuali attacchi al diritto d'autore tramite l'apprendimento automatico dei modelli.</sample>

Ogni modello ha una barra blu che rappresenta i risultati del cumulative e una barra gialla che rappresenta i risultati iterativi. La barra blu per il modello Random è più alta rispetto alla barra blu per i modelli Entropy, CoreSet, CAL e PRC. La barra gialla per il modello Random è molto bassa, ma aumenta gradualmente con i modelli Entropy, CoreSet e CAL, riducendosi nuovamente nel modello PRC. La barra gialla per il modello Random è la più bassa tra tutte le barre. Nella parte superiore a destra dell'immagine, c'è un small video frame che mostra una persona che parla.</sample>

    <sample id="1521">La slide mostra un grafico di confronto delle strategie di apprendimento attivo basate sull'approccio Probability-of-Rare-Class. Il titolo della slide è "Active Learning: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy". Il grafico mostra le AUC (Area Under the Curve) per diverse strategie di apprendimento attivo, con i valori segnalati come segnaposto blu. La strategia di base è indicata come "from scratch" e ha un valore di +0.17. Le altre strategie sono elencate come AL-Random, AL-Entropy, AL-ConSet, AL-CAL, AL-CAL, AL-PIC (noi) e AL-PIC (noi), con i loro rispettivi valori AUC segnalati come segnaposto blu.</sample>
