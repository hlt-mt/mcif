    <sample id="39">The video features a presentation on dependency structures in English, focusing initially on the compatibility of different coordination types with universal dependencies. The slide titled 'Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)' discusses how left conjuncts tend to be shorter than right conjuncts and that this tendency grows with length difference. It includes graphs showing the proportion of left conjunct lengths depending on the absolute difference between left and right conjunct lengths for various governor positions: no governor, governor on the left, and governor on the right. Each graph plots these proportions against different character lengths ('CHARACTERS', 'SYLLABLES', and 'WORDS') and shows confidence bands around each line.\n\nThe focus then shifts to an explanation of the compatibility of different coordination structures with dependency structures of coordination. A table lists four coordination types: Bouquet/Stanford, Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Praque, and Multi-headed/London. Sentences illustrate how Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie under each type, indicating whether they are compatible or not based on their structure. For example, sentences like 'Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie.' marked as 'NO' indicate incompatibility, while others marked as 'YES' show compatibility.\n\nThe presentation continues by detailing the results from Gibson et al., 1996, which noted the tendency of left conjuncts to be shorter than right conjuncts, growing with length difference. This is illustrated through multiple graphs comparing left and right conjunct lengths across characters, syllables, and words. Each graph highlights the relationship between the number of elements and the length difference, providing insights into the distribution patterns observed in the data.\n\nThe final segment reiterates the findings about the tendency of left conjuncts to be shorter than right conjuncts, supported by visual representations of the data distributions. Throughout the clip, there is a small inset image of a person speaking at the top right corner, likely explaining the content being presented.\n\nThe scene transitions smoothly to another section where the title changes to 'Compatibility with Dependency Structures of Coordination,' maintaining the same detailed graphical analysis and explanations regarding the differences in conjunction lengths and their relationships within various coordination structures. The consistent use of color-coded lines helps distinguish between the two types of conjuncts clearly.\n\nThe overall narrative provides a comprehensive overview of the structural characteristics and dependencies in language coordination, emphasizing the importance of understanding these patterns for linguistic research and applications.</sample>
    <sample id="40">The video begins with a slide titled 'Transfer and Active Learning for Annotating Rare Class' from the presentation by Vasudha Varadarajan at Stony Brook University. The slide features two cartoon characters representing disagreement, labeled 'Effects of disagreement,' illustrating cognitive dissonance where one character holds an opinion while the other has doubts about it. A diagram shows how rare class annotations are difficult to annotate due to their rarity, making them easier to annotate once they become more frequent. This is part of the broader topic on cold-start active learning strategies using transfer learning techniques.\n\nThe next slide introduces 'Cold-start AL with transfer learning.' It includes a flowchart depicting the process: starting with M0 (the initial model), followed by iterative updates through M1, M2, and so on until reaching M3. Two types of out-of-domain annotation methods are shown: iterative ('M0 -&gt; M1 -&gt; M2') and cumulative ('M0 -&gt; M1 -&gt; M2'). The slide emphasizes that PRC (Probability of Rare Class) is simple and efficient for rare sample acquisition, illustrated by a visual metaphor comparing rare class annotation to finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nThe subsequent slides delve into various aspects of active learning strategies, including cumulative vs. iterative approaches and the use of PRC. They explain how these strategies can improve annotation efficiency and highlight specific challenges such as the difficulty of annotating rare classes accurately.\n\nThe detailed explanation continues with a focus on the advantages of PRC over other strategies like entropy sampling or random sampling. It illustrates how PRC enhances annotation quality without significantly increasing computational time, thus improving overall performance.\n\nThe final segment provides practical insights and recommendations based on empirical findings, stressing the importance of minimizing annotation cost and maximizing accuracy. It concludes with a summary of key takeaways and references to relevant studies and datasets, providing comprehensive guidance on effective active learning practices.\n\nThe video then transitions to a new section titled 'Takeaways,' which summarizes the main points discussed throughout the presentation. It highlights the simplicity and efficiency of PRC for rare sample acquisition, emphasizing its effectiveness compared to other strategies like entropy sampling or random sampling. The slide also mentions the benefits of cold-start active learning with transfer learning and compares different annotation methods within-out-of-domain scenarios.\n\nThe following slide focuses on the comparison between out-of-domain and in-domain annotation processes. It details how models update iteratively and cumulatively across multiple domains (D1, D2, etc.), showing the progression from M0 to M1, M2, ..., M5. The slide explains that both approaches involve adding new examples to the dataset and updating the model accordingly, but notes differences in the frequency of domain changes per epoch (DCE = 1, DCI = 2).\n\nThe last slide presents contact information for further inquiries, along with three QR codes linking to code, dataset, and paper repositories. It lists email addresses and URLs for accessing additional resources related to the presented research.\n\nFinally, the video ends with a 'Thank you!' message, indicating the conclusion of the presentation.</sample>
    <sample id="41">The video begins with a slide titled 'PEACoK Knowledge: Three-Step Construction' and transitions to an explanation of the three-step construction process. The first step is labeled 'Persona Selection,' which involves selecting personas from existing commonsense knowledge graphs (KGs) and language models (LMs). This selection includes characters, relationships, and attributes that are already available in large-scale KGs or LMs.

The second step focuses on 'Potential Inference Generation.' It explains how these selected personas can be used for potential inference generation by connecting them through their common attributes. Examples include "I am a singer" connected to "I have performed at concerts," demonstrating how these connections help generate coherent narratives based on shared characteristics between different personas.

Next, the third step addresses 'Relation Classification.' It highlights how these relations need to be classified into categories like Characteristic, Routine or Habit, Experience, Goal or Plan, and Relationship. These classifications ensure that the generated narratives align correctly within each persona's context.

The presentation then shifts to discussing the benefits of using PeaCoK, emphasizing its ability to learn more connections between interlocutors, leading to more consistent and engaging conversations. A specific example provided is learning more connections between Sam and his friend, who is also a musician, resulting in better narrative modeling.

The final part of this segment introduces the concept of 'PeaCoK KG,' explaining it as a world-level commonsense knowledge graph containing approximately 100k high-quality commonsense inferences about personas. This comprehensive knowledge base enables reliable training of persona inference generators.

The summary section reiterates key points:
- PeaCoK serves as a world-level persona commonsense knowledge graph.
- It contains around 100k high-quality commonsense inferences related to personas.
- Persona inference generators can be reliably trained using PeaCoK.
- PeaCoK enhances more consistent and engaging narrative modeling.

    <sample id="42">The presentation slide titled 'What Is Needed for Good Generalization?' features a list of bullet points discussing the requirements for good generalization. The first point emphasizes better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine-tuning examples as essential factors. It also highlights that performance drop is caused by temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting. Additionally, it poses the question 'Do CoNLL-2003 taggers still work?' followed by an affirmative answer with a checkmark. At the bottom right corner, there is a Georgia Tech logo.\n\nThe next part of the presentation includes a detailed graph comparing different models' performances on the CoNLL-2003 dataset from 2004 to 2022. Models such as Flair, BERT-base, BERT-large, Stanford NER, BLSTM-CNN-CRF, and LUKE are shown along with their respective F1 scores and parameter counts. This section aims to illustrate how these models have evolved in terms of accuracy and computational resources over time.\n\nThe final segment provides references for further reading or research: a paper available at arXiv.org, a dataset hosted on GitHub, and contact information via email. These details facilitate access to additional materials related to the study presented in the slides.\n\nThe overall structure of the presentation ensures clarity and thoroughness, guiding viewers through key concepts, historical context, and practical implications regarding named entity recognition and its evolution over time.\n\nThe last frame transitions smoothly into this new topic, maintaining consistency with previous sections while introducing fresh content relevant to the ongoing discussion about named entity recognition techniques and their development over time.\n\nThe text 'Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09747 Dataset: https://github.com/ShuhengL/ac2023_conllpp Contact: sliu775@gatech.edu' appears prominently against a background image featuring individuals walking near a building, likely representing Georgia Tech's campus.</sample>
    <sample id="43">The video begins with a title slide that reads 'Transfer and Active Learning for Annotating Rare Classes' from Stony Brook University, specifically focusing on the Human Language Analysis Group. The presentation is part of an academic lecture or conference, as indicated by the formal layout and detailed content related to cognitive dissonance theory and its application in language analysis.\n\nThe first section discusses 'Cognitive Dissonance Theory,' highlighting key concepts such as the difficulty of annotating rare classes due to their rarity compared to common classes (e.g., 'needle in haystack'). It explains how transfer learning can help annotate these rare classes more efficiently. A diagram illustrates this process, showing the transition from difficult annotation to easier annotation through iterative training using a RoBERTa base model with transfer learning. The slide includes references to various studies and conferences where these findings were presented.\n\nNext, the focus shifts to 'Cold-start AL with transfer learning.' This section details the use of cold-start active learning techniques combined with transfer learning strategies. It mentions specific models like M0, M1, M2, and M3, along with their iterative and cumulative processes. Diagrams illustrate both out-of-domain and in-domain scenarios, emphasizing the efficiency and effectiveness of PRC (Probability of Rare Class) strategy in acquiring rare samples.\n\nThe presentation then transitions into practical takeaways regarding different active learning strategies: Cold-start AL with transfer learning, Cumulative AL, Out-of-domain AL, In-domain AL, and the Probability of Rare Class (PRC) strategy. Each method's advantages are highlighted, particularly noting that PRC simplifies and enhances efficient sample acquisition for rare classes.\n\nFollowing this, the segment titled 'Active Learning: Cumulative vs. Iterative' compares the performance metrics between cumulative and iterative approaches. It shows bar charts illustrating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for different methods, indicating that PRC generally performs better than other strategies across most cases. References to studies by Vaswani et al. (2019), Zeng et al. (2018), and others support the claims made about each approach.\n\nThe final slides provide contact information for further inquiries, including email addresses and social media links.

    <sample id="44">The video begins with a title slide displaying 'NLPPositionality' and the subtitle 'Characterizing Design Biases in NLP Datasets.' The names of five individuals are listed: Sebastian Santoro, Jenny Liang, Renan Lebrun, Katharina Reinecke, and Maarten Sijphout. Each name is accompanied by their respective affiliations or titles such as 'New York University,' 'New York Times,' 'New York Post,' 'New York Daily News,' and 'New York Magazine.' The background features an image of books on shelves.

The presentation continues to emphasize the topic of 'NLPPositionality' and its focus on characterizing design biases in NLP datasets. It introduces Carl Malamud's quote from 1985 about how technology affects human life, which reads: 'Technology will affect people more than anything else ever has; it already does so now.'

A new section titled 'Annotator Participation' appears, showing that out of 20 annotators, only one was paid (the rest were unpaid). This indicates a lack of financial compensation for most participants involved in the annotation process.

The next segment highlights 'Study Participation,' noting that there were 16,299 annotations made during the study period. A small inset shows a person seated at a desk with various items like papers and electronic devices visible.

The final part of this sequence presents recommendations under the heading 'Recommendations.' The first recommendation emphasizes keeping records of all relevant design choices throughout building datasets or models. Following this, another recommendation suggests conducting NLP research through the lens of perspectivism:

1. Do NLP research through the lens of perspectivism:
   - Share disaggregated dataset labels!
   - Use modeling techniques that can handle annotator disagreement.
   
Additionally, specialized datasets and models with and for specific communities are valuable for inclusive NLP initiatives, citing Masakhane initiative.

The bottom left corner includes a link to 'https://www.masakhane.io,' providing further resources related to the discussion points mentioned above.

The overall theme revolves around addressing positionalities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) frameworks, highlighting issues of bias and the need for diverse perspectives in data collection and model development.</sample>

The presentation then transitions to a section labeled '1. Text Simplification' with subheadings like 'Simplicity,' 'LexSimp,' and 'StructSimp.' It explains different types of text simplification methods using an example from news data, showing how complex sentences are simplified into plain language through substitution, clause deletion, reordering, word deletion, and insertion techniques.\n\nNext, the focus shifts to a detailed table comparing various evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE on DEPLAIN-APA test sets. This is followed by another comparison between DEPLAIN-APA and DEPLAIN-WEB test sets, highlighting differences in scores across datasets like 'news,' 'public,' and 'web.'\n\nThe narrative continues with a close-up view of these tables, emphasizing the performance variations among different models and datasets. The segment concludes with a title card that reads 'Automatic Alignment Evaluation,' indicating the next part of the discussion will cover automatic alignment evaluations within the context of text simplification.\n\nThe final frames show a person presenting or speaking at a podium, suggesting a live demonstration or lecture setting related to the previous slides' content on automatic alignment evaluations in text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="51">The slide titled 'Dataset Collection' discusses the collection of alternative questions and indirect referring expressions. It mentions that approximately 6,000 alternative questions were collected across three domains, with about 42,000 indirect referring expressions. The methodology for collecting these data points is emphasized as informal and includes a cartoon completion task to generate alternative questions.

The slide also details the accuracy results using T5 XL model:
- 92-95% if the LM has access to the same background knowledge as annotators.
- 82-87% when the LM has access to partially overlapping background knowledge.
- Approximately 60% when the LM (T5 XL) only has access to the entity names.

It concludes by stating that shown models are domain-generalizable and provides a dataset link: https://github.com/google-research/datasets/AltEntities.

The Google Research logo appears in the top right corner throughout this segment.

The next section on the slide is labeled 'Background knowledge (Recipes)' which presents information about Simnel Cake and Pandan Cake. 

Simnel Cake is described as a fruitcake widely eaten in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and other countries with patterns of migration from there associated with Lent and Easter. It is distinguished by layers of almond paste or marzipan and a set of eleven balls made of the same paste. An image shows a decorated cake with almonds and fruits.

Pandan Cake is light, fluffy, green-colored sponge cake flavored with the juices of Pandanus amaryllifolius leaves. It is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Netherlands among the Indo community. A photo depicts a slice of the cake with a creamy filling.

The slide emphasizes that both cakes have their own unique characteristics but share common elements like being fruitcakes and having specific ingredients and flavors tied to cultural traditions.

The final part of the presentation features a slide titled 'Eliciting expressions.' This slide explains how annotators select choices based on given examples such as "Do you mean A or B?" and asks them to fill out an expression related to the example provided. For instance, it gives the prompt "Do you mean Easy on Me or I Gotta Feeling?"

The slide then transitions into another segment where the title remains 'Eliciting expressions,' continuing the explanation of the process. It reiterates the selection method through annotated prompts and fills out expressions corresponding to those prompts.

The detailed breakdown continues with illustrative text boxes showing different scenarios involving music artists Adele and The Black Eyed Peas, along with images of songs and lyrics to help annotators understand the context better.

The slide maintains its focus on eliciting correct expressions by providing clear instructions and relevant visual aids to guide the annotation process effectively.

It introduces the concept of positional bias as part of NLP research. The main content is divided into sections labeled 'Analysis,' 'Models,' and 'Datasets.' Each section provides detailed information about datasets used for model training, including their characteristics such as age ranges, gender distributions, education levels, ethnicities, religions, countries of residence, country lengths, native languages, and more. The slide also highlights that these datasets are diverse across various demographics like African Islamic communities (15-24 years old), Catholic European communities (18-30 years old), Confucian Asian communities (26-49 years old), English-speaking communities (17-40 years old), Hispanic Latin American communities (22-45 years old), Orthodox European communities (25-40 years old), Protestant European communities (25-40 years old), West Asian communities (25-40 years old), and South Asian communities (25-40 years old). The text emphasizes that "Datasets and models are most aligned with non-English speaking populations," suggesting a focus on inclusivity within NLP practices.\n\nThe next slide continues from the previous one, maintaining the same layout and details. It reiterates the analysis, models, and datasets sections, emphasizing the diversity of the data collected. This reinforces the importance of considering positional bias when analyzing language processing tasks.\n\nThe subsequent slides maintain this format, providing additional context or concluding remarks based on the discussion points covered earlier. They include sections like 'Recommendations,' which suggest keeping records of design choices throughout building datasets or models, doing NLP research through the lens of perspectivism, sharing disaggregated dataset labels, using modeling techniques that can handle annotator disagreement, and developing specialized datasets and models with and for specific communities valuable for inclusive NLP initiatives. The final slide presents recommendations for addressing positional bias in NLP, highlighting its significance in creating fairer algorithms and tools.</sample>

It highlights that these methods require clean samples, but noisy labels can harm generalization and lead to poor performance on validation data. The slide includes a graph comparing different models under various conditions, showing how some models perform better with more labeled training data ('FT_C') compared to others ('Cosine'). A red dashed box emphasizes the importance of having enough labeled training data for effective model performance.\n\nThe next section is titled 'Conclusion,' which summarizes key points about recent WSL approaches and recommendations. It notes that while many claim to work well without much annotated data, they often overestimate their practicality due to reliance on clean samples. Recommendations include reporting model selection criteria, using few-shot learning as baselines, applying continuous fine-tuning, and emphasizing the necessity of sufficient labeled training data.\n\nThe final part of the presentation features a 'THANK YOU!' message in green text within an orange speech bubble, expressing gratitude to the audience. This segment concludes the detailed discussion on the limitations and practical considerations of weakly supervised learning approaches.\n\nThe conclusion continues with additional remarks highlighting the need for clean samples and cautioning against overestimating the practicality of certain methods. Emphasized are the benefits of using fewer labeled training examples when possible, especially if it leads to significant improvements in accuracy or performance metrics like F1 score. The slide underscores the advantages of employing few-shot learning techniques and maintaining high levels of annotation quality during training phases such as 'FT_C' and 'CFT.'\n\nA QR code at the bottom right corner provides a link to the full slides: 'https://github.com/zhengyuhao/ACL2023'. This comprehensive approach aims to ensure robustness and effectiveness in machine learning tasks by prioritizing adequate labeling and leveraging advanced few-shot learning strategies.\n\nThe overall theme throughout this segment remains focused on addressing common pitfalls and misconceptions associated with WSL methodologies, advocating for thorough preparation through ample labeled training data and innovative solutions to optimize model performance.\n\nThe slide transitions smoothly from discussing specific issues related to WSL approaches to providing actionable insights and concluding remarks aimed at guiding future research and application practices in the field of weakly supervised learning.\n\nThe visual elements consistently support the textual content, reinforcing the messages conveyed regarding the critical aspects of label quality, model evaluation, and the strategic use of few-shot learning techniques.</sample>
    <sample id="54">The video begins with a presentation slide titled 'Transfer and Active Learning for Annotating Rare Classes' from Stony Brook University, specifically focusing on the topic of cognitive dissonance. The presenter's name is Vasudha Varadarajan, as indicated by her small window in the top right corner. The main content discusses how rare class annotation can be difficult to annotate due to inconsistencies between thoughts, actions, and beliefs. It introduces the concept of transfer learning and active learning strategies for annotating rare classes.\n\nThe next part transitions into an explanation of why dissonance makes annotations more challenging, highlighting that cognitive dissonance involves one class being inconsistent among three elements: thought, action, and belief. A diagram illustrates this inconsistency with two stick figures facing each other, labeled 'Effects of disagreement.'\n\nFollowing this, the presentation delves deeper into the challenges posed by cognitive dissonance.

It mentions specific examples like "What could Jessica before selling the spotlights?" and "Who might Aaron have sold them." The graph shows the accuracy differences between various prefix types across input lengths, indicating a significant drop-off as the prefix length increases. The text notes that the accuracy decreases sharply after 100 tokens, suggesting that models may struggle with longer sequences.\n\nA detailed analysis follows, where perturbations such as adding prefixes or changing their order affect model performance differently based on the prefix type. For instance, adding prefixes affects the accuracy more than removing them. The text suggests that models should be sensitive to these perturbations.\n\nThe final part addresses the sensitivity of language models to latent syntactic/semantic features shared across sentences. It states that single-sentence inputs do not fully capture LMs' abstract knowledge, emphasizing the importance of understanding how these features influence model behavior.</sample>

    <sample id="150">The presentation slide titled 'MeetingQA: Introduction' introduces the MeetingQA dataset, which is an extractive question-answering (QA) task based on meeting transcripts. It highlights that millions of questions and answers are collected from over 100 meetings across various industries such as technology, healthcare, education, finance, marketing, sales, operations, product management, customer support, HR, legal, compliance, IT, and more.\n\nThe slide provides a detailed breakdown of the types of questions asked during these meetings, including rhetorical, discussion-seeking, multi-speaker, and span questions. It also notes that around half of all questions in the dataset contain disagreement or conflict between speakers, making it challenging for models to identify which speaker answered a particular question. The average length of transcript segments ranges from approximately 25K words to nearly 30K words, with most spans containing multiple sentences rather than single sentences.\n\nThe slide emphasizes the difficulty faced by existing QA models when dealing with this dataset due to its unique characteristics. It mentions that there is no significant gap between human performance and model performance in terms of F1 score, but challenges remain, especially regarding understanding rhetorical questions and handling multi-speaker scenarios.\n\nThe section labeled 'Experimental Results: Finetuned' presents bar charts comparing different models' performances under finetuned settings. It shows the percentage of unanswerable pred answers and speaker IoU in error models for both short-context and long-context models. The results indicate slight differences among the models, highlighting their varying levels of success in answering questions accurately.\n\nThe final part of the slide focuses on 'Experimental Results: Error Analysis,' detailing specific errors made by the models. It explains that models struggle with identifying rhetorical questions, particularly in zero-shot setting, where context spans slightly outperform long-context spans. Multi-span models have significantly lower accuracy compared to single-span models, indicating difficulties in recognizing which speakers answer certain questions.\n\nThe takeaways emphasize that MeetingQA poses significant challenges for existing QA models, lagging behind human performance notably in finetuned settings and even more so in zero-shot settings. This underscores the complexity of the dataset and the ongoing need for advancements in QA model development to handle real-world conversational data effectively.\n\nThe slide concludes with contact information for further inquiries, providing a project page link and an email address for reaching out to the researchers involved in the study.</sample>

    <sample id="171">The slide titled 'Background' introduces the concept of watermarking in large language models (LLMs) and embedding-based services, emphasizing their exceptional performance in natural language understanding tasks. It highlights challenges such as model theft through backdoor attacks and the need for robust copyright protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use or leakage of intellectual property within these systems. The text explains that existing solutions are not applicable due to privacy concerns but suggests a new approach called EmbMarker, which aims to address these issues by incorporating watermarking techniques into EaaS platforms.\n\nThe next section labeled 'Existing Works' provides detailed information on various datasets used in experiments, including AG News, Enron Spam, MIND, and SST2, along with metrics like accuracy and detection performance using specific methods. This part emphasizes the importance of evaluating different approaches to ensure effective watermarking and reliable copyright verification in LLMs and EaaS platforms.\n\nThe final segment focuses on 'Experimental Results,' showcasing four scatter plots visualizing embeddings from different datasets: AG News, Enron Spam, MIND, and SST2. These plots illustrate how the data points align across different conditions, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. The results indicate significant improvements in terms of accuracy and detection performance, demonstrating the practical benefits of integrating watermarking into real-world applications involving large language models and embedded service providers.\n\nThe presentation concludes with a slide simply stating 'Thanks!' indicating the end of the presentation.</sample>
    <sample id="172">The slide titled 'Cross-lingual Performance Gap' presents a radar chart comparing the performance of different models across various datasets. The chart includes four categories: Matis, MGEOQuery, MSniper, MOveright, MCWQI, and MTOP. Each category is represented by a line on the radar chart, with numerical values indicating the model's performance in each dataset. The lines are color-coded to differentiate between various training methods or settings. At the bottom of the chart, there is an average score for each category, providing a comprehensive view of how well each model performs overall. This detailed visual representation helps in understanding the comparative effectiveness of different approaches within the context of cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.\n\nThe next slide continues this analysis but focuses specifically on multilingual LLMs (Large Language Models). It highlights that Enc-Dec (mT5) outperforms previous work or achieves comparable results. Additionally, it emphasizes that pretraining on English can significantly boost performance on target NLs (Natural Languages), while Chinese transfer learning and monolingual training usually yield better outcomes than En -&gt; En transfers. German has the smallest performance gap among these languages. FunQL generally outperforms other representations, although SQL still shows significant room for improvement. This section provides insights into the current state of language modeling techniques and their application in cross-lingual scenarios.\n\nThe following slides delve deeper into specific findings from the paper. They highlight that mT5 with monolingual training yields the best performance, especially compared to multilingual LLMs like Bloom. A comprehensive benchmark study was conducted on three representative types of multilingual language models. Results show that mT5 with monolingual training excels, particularly in handling cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks. However, notable gaps remain when transferring between multiple languages, emphasizing the ongoing challenges in achieving seamless multi-language integration in AI models.\n\nThe final sections conclude with practical applications and future directions. These include building XSemPLR as a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing, conducting extensive studies on diverse language models, and highlighting key takeaways such as the superior performance of mT5 with monolingual training over multilingual counterparts. Despite improvements, significant performance gaps persist between monolingual and cross-lingual training methods, underscoring areas needing further research and development to enhance real-world applicability of AI systems in multilingual contexts.\n\nThis presentation aims to provide a thorough overview of the advancements and remaining challenges in the field of cross-lingual semantic

    <sample id="174">The video begins with a title slide introducing 'ArgAnalysis35K,' described as the largest dataset for argument quality analysis, sourced from winning debaters and expert annotators. It highlights its large scale of 35,000 arguments across various themes like education, banking, government policies, corporate ethics, and environmental issues.\n\nThe presentation transitions to an overview of Argument Quality Analysis (AQA), explaining that it involves judging how good or bad an argument is on a scale of 0-1. Examples are given: 'Big banks take risks and so they are bad' rated at 0.47, indicating some validity but not complete truthfulness; another example states big banks have no accountability and can lead to major collapses, suggesting breaking them up if true.\n\nThe relevance model section follows, detailing how annotators use their judgment based on past experiences and biases in rating arguments related to topics such as politics, authoritarian regimes, environment, etc., using scores between 0-1 for each arg-analysis pair.\n\nAnnotator reliability is discussed next, emphasizing the need for bias correction through training models like IA model Expectation Maximization and FNN classifiers to predict the true value of annotations accurately.\n\nThe final segment focuses on the Relevance Model, illustrating how arguments about accountability and free speech relate to specific groups like LGBTQ members. The model assigns scores ranging from 0-1 for different themes, providing insights into the accuracy of these ratings.\n\nThe person continues to speak throughout, maintaining engagement by gesturing while discussing the concepts presented. The background remains consistent, featuring a greenish hue and text boxes outlining key points. \n\nThe video concludes with detailed explanations of the Relevance Model's application to various political and social contexts, ensuring clarity on the scoring system and its implications for understanding argument quality within diverse thematic areas.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a new topic titled 'Relevance Model!' This part discusses the importance of relevant arguments in debates involving governments, churches, corporations, schools, etc., focusing on themes like politics, authoritarian regimes, and environments. The speaker elaborates on how certain arguments may be biased due to personal experiences, particularly highlighting racism against Asians. The explanation includes examples where someone who has experienced racism might rate Asian arguments more favorably out of sympathy rather than factual correctness.\n\nThe discussion emphasizes the necessity of correcting for such biases using techniques like IA model Expectation Maximization and FNN classifiers. These methods help generate per-instance annotation reliabilities and predict the true values of arguments, aiming to improve the overall accuracy of the dataset.\n\nThroughout this segment, the presenter uses hand gestures to emphasize points, making sure to convey the complexity and significance of addressing biases in argument evaluation processes. The visual elements remain unchanged, keeping the focus on delivering comprehensive information regarding the Relevance Model and its applications in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe frame shows the same individual continuing to explain the concept of Argument Quality Analysis (AQA). The text box reiterates that AQA simply judges how good or bad an argument is on a scale of 0-1. An example table provides further clarification, listing arguments like 'Big banks are bad' with a score of 0.12, 'Big banks take risks and so they are bad' with a score of 0.47, and 'Big banks have no accountability, and take heavy risks that can lead to major collapses-affecting the entire economy-and hence should be broken up' also scored at 1.

    <sample id="221">The slide titled 'Experimental Results' summarizes key findings from the study, emphasizing that example quality is more important than similarity to source sentences. It highlights that specialized SOTA systems have a significant advantage and mentions that PaLM closely matches Google Translate's performance. The insights section notes that fluency of PaLM is comparable to SOTA but generally lower accuracy scores for style/awkwardness due to "Accuracy/Omission."</sample>
    <sample id="222">The presentation slide titled 'Open-domain QA' focuses on the challenges and solutions related to open-domain question answering. It discusses how data interventions can enable out-of-domain generalization, understand the nature of compatibility between source models for target domains, and determine effective data interventions based on dataset shifts. The slide highlights specific examples such as 'Narora Atomic Power Station (NAPS)' and its role in producing oat flour from sorghum.</sample>
    <sample id="223">The image features a presentation slide with the title 'From Pretraining Data to Downstream Tasks' and includes four individuals: Shangbin Feng, Chan Young Park, Yuhan Liu, and Yulia Tsetkova. The background is white with black text, and there are logos from various institutions at the bottom of the slide.</sample>
    <sample id="224">The video begins with a title slide that reads 'DEPLAIN: A New Parallel Corpus for German Text Simplification' in bold black letters on a white background. Below the main title, additional text provides details about the authors and their affiliations: Regina Stodden, Omar Momen, Laura Kallmeyer from Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, presented at ACL 2023. The top right corner of this slide features an image of two individuals engaged in conversation or presentation.\n\nThe scene transitions to another title slide titled 'Text Simplification'. This slide poses questions such as 'What is simplification?', 'Why do we need it?', and 'How can we simplify?' It also includes a bar chart comparing different levels of sentence complexity (e.g., 'Simple', 'Intermediate', 'Complex') across various texts like 'news', 'bible', 'L2', and 'fiction'.\n\nFollowing this, there is a detailed graph illustrating text simplification transformations using DEPLAIN-APA and DEPLAIN-WEB methods. The graph shows how substitution, clause deletion, reordering, word deletion, and insertion are applied to transform complex sentences into simpler ones. The transformation process involves replacing words ('substitution'), removing clauses ('clause deletion'), rearranging parts of speech ('reordering'), deleting unnecessary words ('word deletion'), and adding new information ('insertion'). The original sentence 'Die GewÃ¤hrleistung setzt sich dafÃ¼r ein, dass der Betrag des Lohns hÃ¶her bleibt.' is simplified to 'Die GewÃ¤hrleistung setzt sich dafÃ¼r ein, dass der Betrag fÃ¼r Beispiel fÃ¼r hÃ¶here LÃ¶hne oder Urlaub ein.'\n\nThe next segment presents a table summarizing results obtained by applying DEPLAIN-APA and DEPLAIN-WEB to the training data. Columns include metrics labeled 'BLEU', 'F1', 'P', 'R', and 'N'. Rows compare performance against baseline models, showing improvements in scores when DEPLAIN methods are used. Specific examples illustrate these improvements, such as 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=48)' versus 'baseline', achieving higher BLEU and F1 scores while maintaining similar P and R values.\n\nThe final part of the sequence displays a comprehensive comparison between DEPLAIN-APA and DEPLAIN-WEB methods tested on different datasets including 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=48)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=72)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=96)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=120)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=144)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=168)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=200)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=250)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test (n=300)', 'DEPLAIN-APA test

    <sample id="354">The slide titled 'What Is Needed for Good Generalization?' lists the following points: - Better model architecture - Larger model size - More fine-tuning examples The performance drop is attributed to temporal drift and not adaptive overfitting. It concludes with a question about whether CoNLL-2003 taggers still work, which is answered affirmatively with "YES!"</sample>
    <sample id="355">The video begins with a slide titled 'Transfer and Active Learning for Annotating Rare Classes' from Stony Brook University, specifically focusing on the topic of cognitive dissonance. The title is displayed in bold black letters at the top center of the white background slide. Below the title, there are two main sections: 'Cold-start AL with transfer learning' and 'Entry and Exit from Extremism,' each accompanied by relevant diagrams illustrating these concepts. On the right side of the slide, there is an image of a person labeled 'Vibha Varadarajan @cs_stonybrook' within a small window. At the bottom left corner, there is a citation reference to 'Eddie Halperin et al., 2019.' The slide number '6' appears at the bottom right corner.

The presentation continues with another slide under the same section header, but this time it focuses on 'Attitudes and Belief trends.' This new section includes a diagram showing the transition from rare class annotation (labeled as 'needle in a haystack') to easier annotation over time. There is also text explaining that increasing the chance of rare classes makes annotations more difficult due to cognitive dissonance being one such class. Additionally, there is a note about PRC's simplicity and efficiency for rare sample acquisition. A flowchart illustrates the process of model retrain/update during active learning iterations, including steps like 'new examples,' 'humans annotate,' and 'add new examples.'

The next part of the presentation shows a slide titled 'Active Learning: Cumulative vs Iterative Update Strategy.' It features a comparison chart listing various strategies along with their performance metrics ('Rare %,' 'Time (s),' and 'Subj. diff.') For example, 'RANDOM' has a rare percentage of 3.20, takes 11.96 seconds, and has a subjective difference of -0.065. Other entries include 'ENTROPY,' 'CORESET,' 'CAL,' and 'PRC,' each with different values indicating their respective performances. Additional notes mention minimum annotation cost not necessarily leading to better models and how rarity can make annotations more difficult because cognitive dissonance is one such class. To increase dissonance samples, PRC works best. 

The final segment displays a slide with three QR codes linked to code, dataset, and paper resources related to the study. Contact information for Vibha Varadarajan, Matthew Muhlenkamp, Syedul Islam, and H. Andrew Schwartz is provided, directing viewers to GitHub, Human Language Analysis Beings, and arXiv links respectively. The contact details include email addresses and URLs. The slide concludes with a 'Thank you!' message and emphasizes the importance of understanding cognitive dissonance through visual aids and detailed explanations throughout the presentation.</sample>
    <sample id="356">The slide titled 'Compositional Generalization without Trees' presents a detailed explanation of compositional generalization in semantic parsing. It emphasizes the importance of trees and introduces a permutation model for inducing alignment during training, highlighting that inference is NP-hard (TSP) and involves backpropagation through continuous relaxation. The visual elements include a diagram showing tagged words like 'girl,' 'sleep,' and 'agent,' with arrows indicating relationships between them. A QR code at the bottom right corner provides access to additional resources or papers related to the topic.</sample>
    <sample id="357">The video features a person with long hair tied back, wearing glasses and dressed in a green top. The background reveals an indoor setting with modern furniture, including red chairs and tables.</sample>
    <sample id="358">The slide features a white background with black text. The main heading reads 'RQ1: When does translation require context?' Below this, there is a subheading that states 'Context-aware models perform significantly better on some phenomena.' A bullet point follows, listing the specific phenomena where these models excel and those they struggle with. Additionally, it mentions that DeepL outperforms Google on most phenomena and language pairs as of April 2021. At the bottom right corner, there is an image of a robot icon representing artificial intelligence or machine learning.</sample>
    <sample id="359">The presentation slide titled 'Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Translation' features the logo of the University of Trento and the Fondazione Bruno Kessler. The main content discusses the use of attention mechanisms in simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (SimulST) to ensure stability by considering the sum of attention weights over time frames.\n\nThe slide transitions to another part of the presentation, introducing 'EDAtt,' which stands for Encoder-Decoder Attention. It explains that EDAtt is tailored specifically for SimulST models with an architecture designed to optimize performance across different latency regimes. A graph shows BLEU scores against AL/AL_CA (attention latency) values, demonstrating how EDAtt outperforms other strategies like wait-k, LA, CAAT, and baseline methods when considering actual elapsed time.\n\nThe final segment emphasizes that EDAtt achieves the highest BLEU score at specific latency intervals, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional methods. Contact information for Sara Papi and Marco Turchi from FBK is provided, along with social media handles for further engagement.\n\nThe video concludes with a call to action, encouraging viewers to read their paper for more results and providing contact details via email, GitHub, and Twitter. Additionally, it includes a QR code labeled 'Scan me!' for easy access to the resources mentioned.\n\nThe detailed explanation covers various aspects such as the challenges faced in SimulST, solutions proposed, experimental setup, results comparison, and practical applications of EDAtt in enhancing SimulST accuracy and speed.</sample>
    <sample id="361">The presentation slide titled 'CounterComp: Metric learning using counterfactual examples' is displayed. The main content of the slide includes a table comparing different models based on their program accuracy across various benchmarks and unseen programs, as well as a section labeled 'Top attended tokens during the generation of divide.' This part lists specific tokens such as 'divide,' 'subtract,' 'add,' 'percent,' 'ratio,' 'per year,' and 'annual.' Each token appears to be associated with its frequency or usage count in the context of question answering tasks. Additionally, there are references listed at the bottom left corner of the slide, citing several academic papers related to numerical reasoning over financial data, compositional generalization for multi-step reasoning, hierarchical labelling datasets, neural parsing via span-level supervised attention, and empirical significance in NLP.</sample>
