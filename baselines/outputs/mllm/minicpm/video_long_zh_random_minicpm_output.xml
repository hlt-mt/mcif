    <sample id="145">The video begins with a white background and the text 'NLP' in large, bold letters. Below it, there is smaller text that reads 'Positionality'. The scene transitions to another slide titled 'NLPPositionality', which includes additional details about positionality research by Savin-Baden et al., Magliano et al., and Howell-Maher et al. A small image of a person appears on the right side of the screen throughout this segment.

Next, the title changes to 'Imagine you are an AI,' followed by a subtitle: 'You have been asked to characterize people based solely on their written words.' An illustration depicts two figures labeled 'AI' and 'Carl' engaged in conversation. Carl's speech bubble contains the word 'jerk.' Another figure states 'Can you tell if someone has bad intentions?' This part emphasizes the challenge of inferring intent from language alone.

The narrative continues with the same setup, reinforcing the difficulty of determining intent without context or other information.

The focus then shifts to a new topic introduced as 'Task B: Toxicity (Dynahate).' Participants rate sentences like 'I'm going to punch him!' and 'Can't believe how rude he was today!' using scales ranging from 1-5. The goal is to assess whether these statements can be classified as hate speech or not. Examples include 'He said I should go back where I came from' rated at level 4, indicating strong disagreement but not necessarily hate speech, while 'He called me a terrorist' receives a rating of 3, suggesting some disagreement but not clear hate speech.

A bar graph follows, showing ratings for different scenarios such as 'Man,' 'Non-binary,' and 'Woman,' highlighting varying levels of agreement across participants. The total number of annotations is noted as 16,299, emphasizing the extensive data collected through this process.

The presentation addresses study participation, noting that out of 807 unique annotators, only one participant annotated more than once. It concludes with a link to Masakhane.io, providing further resources for those interested in exploring NLP positionality initiatives.

The final slides provide recommendations for addressing positional bias in NLP:
1. Keep a record of all relevant design choices made throughout building datasets or models.
2. Do NLP research through the lens of perspectivism:
   - Share disaggregated dataset labels!
   - Use modeling techniques that can handle annotator disagreement.
3. Building specialized datasets and models with and for specific communities is valuable for inclusive NLP (e.g., Masakhane initiative).

The overall theme revolves around understanding and mitigating positional biases in natural language processing tasks, particularly focusing on characterizing individuals based on their written communication and assessing toxicity in online interactions.</sample>

Unlike the previous clip, this segment lacks any visual distractions or thematic elements, focusing purely on delivering a quantitative cue regarding the duration of the playback so far. The stark contrast between the black background and the single white numeral draws immediate attention to the passage of time, facilitating easy tracking of progression through the media content. This utilitarian purpose contrasts sharply with prior clips rich in conceptual depth and illustrative detail, marking a shift towards a simpler interface aimed explicitly at temporal navigation rather than narrative exposition. The decision to employ such a basic graphic element underscores the functionality-focused intention of this particular segment, offering users a quick reference point amidst what might follow as more elaborate portions of the presentation continue.\n\nThe consistent theme observed here revolves around the efficient communication of essential metadata, ensuring smooth navigation through the overarching structure of the recorded materials. By integrating these markers directly onto the screen, creators can guide viewers effortlessly through their productions, whether they're engaged in live demonstrations, lectures, tutorials, or other forms of interactive education. Such transparent tools not only streamline user experiences but also reflect modern trends in digital pedagogy and entertainment sectors where intuitive interfaces play pivotal roles in maximizing accessibility and usability.\n\nThe significance of incorporating such timestamps lies in their universal appeal—it transcends cultural barriers and technical complexities, universally understood symbols aiding in global comprehension irrespective of native languages or specialized knowledge domains. Thus, embedding numbers like '12' helps bridge gaps in auditory-only mediums, enabling synchronous alignment between audio and visual content delivery, thus enriching the holistic educational landscape.\n\nThe recurring motif of simplicity in this segment echoes prevalent strategies in contemporary digital content production, balancing aesthetic considerations with practical necessities. While the latter half often indulges in intricate designs and immersive stories, introductory or transitional parts frequently revert to elemental principles, prioritizing clarity and efficiency over decorative embellishments. This balance fosters inclusivity and adaptability, catering to varied demographics ranging from novices navigating unfamiliar territories to seasoned professionals seeking concise navigational aids.\n\nThe usage of numeric indicators exemplifies best practices in modern e-learning environments, wherein brevity meets precision, streamlining access to valuable information efficiently. As technology advances, similar integrations become increasingly sophisticated, employing advanced algorithms capable of detecting gestures, voice commands, or facial expressions to automate such prompts dynamically, augmenting user interactions beyond mere passive observation. This evolution promises enhanced immersion and responsiveness, revolutionizing traditional teaching methodologies into adaptive, personalized journeys tailored uniquely to individual needs and preferences.\n\nIn essence, the incorporation of numerical markers like '12' serves dual purposes: it acts as a rudimentary yet effective tool for temporal orientation and embodies evolving paradigms in digital instruction. By merging function with form, creators ensure seamless integration of critical informational elements, bolstering the efficacy of their outputs across diverse platforms and contexts.\n\nThe video opens with a completely black screen, signaling the beginning of a new segment or a transition phase. There are no visible texts, subtitles, or graphics present in this frame, adhering strictly to the darkness. This uninterrupted stretch of pitch-black space denotes a deliberate pause or break within the presentation, possibly meant to provide viewers with a momentary respite before proceeding to the next piece of content. The absence of any discernible activity or change implies a focused anticipation of future developments, hinting at potential upcoming revelations or continuations of existing topics. This phase serves multiple functions: it allows for synchronization adjustments, offers breathing room amid dense content, or simply marks a stylistic choice to punctuate the narrative flow. The profound silence captured here accentuates suspenseful buildup or reflective contemplation, depending on the preceding context, promising intrigue and curiosity for ensuing disclosures.\n\nThe transition marked by complete darkness signals readiness for imminent illumination, foreshadowing a transformative leap into fresh insights or dramatic unveilings. Viewers are poised to expect vivid transformations, whether through striking visual effects, thought-provoking narrations, or groundbreaking discoveries—all aligned meticulously to uphold the integrity and momentum of the discourse initiated elsewhere. This strategic utilization of empty intervals amplifies the overall rhythm and emotional resonance of the medium, crafting a well-rounded sensory experience encompassing sight, sound, and anticipation alike.\n\nThe video progresses into a new segment characterized by a predominantly white background, contrasting significantly with the entirely black screen that preceded it. A faint shadow cast on the upper right-hand corner of the frame introduces a subtle variation in lighting dynamics, hinting at underlying structural elements or ambient sources outside the camera's view.

    <sample id="181">The image shows a slide from the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, held in Toronto, Canada, on July 9-14, 2023. The title of the presentation is "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning." The presenter's name and affiliation are Siyu Yuan from Fudan University.\n\nThe main content focuses on how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill script knowledge through symbolic knowledge distillation techniques like Coarse-to-Fine (CoF) distillation. It explains that LLMs generate specific goals with InstructGPT via in-context learning, over-generate these scripts, and then filter them using CoScopt. The process involves generating high-quality scripts based on abstract datasets and evaluating their ability to plan under constraints.\n\nThe slide details various steps: Step 1 - Generate specific goals; Step 2 - Over-generate candidate scripts; Step 3 - Filter scripts by semantic similarity score. It also mentions that smaller LM models fine-tuned on CoScopt can produce higher quality scripts compared to larger LLMS. The approach aims to improve research on constrained planning problems by providing more complex and multi-faceted data sets.\n\nThe summary section emphasizes establishing the constrained language planning problem, evaluating LLMs' planning abilities, developing filtering methods, and utilizing CoScopt to create high-quality scripts. The limitations include the post-hoc nature of improving LLMs and the need for one extra constraint per example. The future work suggests using CoScopt as a resource for advancing research on language planning with more complex scenarios.\n\nThe final part highlights the importance of understanding the types of errors made during this process and the role of CoScopt in producing high-quality scripts. It concludes by stating that CoScopt can serve as a valuable resource for enhancing research on language planning tasks involving multiple objectives and constraints.\n\nThe detailed explanation includes examples such as making a cake for different purposes like weddings or birthdays, emphasizing the use of specific ingredients and cooking processes. The slide provides visual aids like pie charts showing accuracy metrics for different models and bar graphs comparing performance across various benchmarks.\n\nOverall, the presentation outlines a comprehensive method for improving LLMs through structured planning and evaluation, aiming to enhance the capabilities of AI systems in handling real-world language planning challenges effectively.\n\nThe background features an indoor setting with modern furniture, including red chairs and tables, suggesting a professional environment likely within an office or conference room.

It explains that the dataset consists of 62 multimodal tasks categorized into ten groups, covering Visual Entailment, Grounded Captioning, Referential Expression Selection, Question-Answering, Text Localization, Visual Entailment, and Region Understanding. The slide lists six subcategories within these groups, demonstrating the diversity and specificity of the tasks included in the dataset.\n\nThe next section elaborates on the implementation details of the dataset. It describes the steps taken to create the dataset, mentioning the use of a large-scale multimodal instruction tuning dataset with approximately 150 additional vision-language tasks. The slide outlines the criteria used to select tasks, emphasizing the need for high-quality, well-annotated, and visually rich tasks to ensure comprehensive representation of various modalities.\n\nThe following part delves deeper into the dataset characteristics, noting that most tasks involve natural language descriptions paired with visual inputs, totaling nearly 4 million instances. It stresses the necessity of balanced distributions among classes and careful curation to avoid bias and ensure fairness in model training.\n\nThe slide then moves onto the evaluation metrics used in the experiment. It specifies the use of ROUGE-L for evaluating generated text quality and accuracy. The metrics reported cover a range of scores from -1.73 to +1.98, indicating varying levels of precision and recall across different test sets. The slide also references Table 1, suggesting that readers should consult the full paper for detailed experimental setups and results.\n\nThe next section transitions into discussing the effect of divergent instruction numbers on instruction tuning. It illustrates that OFA finetuned on five instructions achieves markedly improved performance across all evaluation tasks compared to finetuning on one instruction. However, increasing the number of instructions does not yield proportional increases in performance, particularly evident in the Image Understanding category. This observation underscores the importance of balancing instruction complexity with model capacity to optimize performance.\n\nThe following part addresses the challenge posed by the absence of ground truth labels in some tasks. It acknowledges the difficulty in measuring performance accurately due to missing reference answers and highlights the necessity of employing appropriate evaluation metrics despite incomplete annotations. The slide advises caution in interpreting results influenced by imperfect labeling, stressing the need for realistic expectations and adaptive assessment strategies.\n\nThe subsequent section summarizes the limitations of existing evaluation protocols. It notes that traditional metrics often fail to capture important aspects of multimodal tasks, leading to misleading conclusions. To overcome these issues, the protocol proposed uses ROUGE-L as a primary metric, supplemented by other measures like BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr to assess different facets of model performance comprehensively.\n\nThe slide then transitions to a graph depicting the relationship between the number of instructions and model performance. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 10, representing the count of instructions, while the y-axis spans from 0 to 1. Two lines chart the performance trend: one marked in red and blue, possibly denoting different variations or conditions. The legend clarifies that the line colors correspond to different models or configurations being evaluated. This graphical representation helps visualize how varying input instruction quantities influence model output quality, offering a clear comparative view of the effects observed in the experimental context.\n\nThe next part of the presentation begins with a slide titled 'Effectiveness of Instruction Tuning on Multimodal Tasks,' continuing the analysis started in the previous sections. It revisits the concept of instruction tuning on OFA (OpenAI's foundation model), specifically examining its performance under different conditions. The slide showcases a bar chart comparing the mean performance score across three distinct columns: 'Finetuned on 1 instruction,' 'Finetuned on 5 instructions,' and 'Finetuned on 10 instructions.'\n\nEach column corresponds to a different scenario of instruction usage, represented by bars colored differently—red for 1 instruction, green for 5 instructions, and yellow for 10 instructions. The chart quantitatively demonstrates how the performance improves progressively with increased instruction counts up to a certain point, after which no significant gain occurs. For instance, the 'Finetuned on 5 instructions' group exhibits notably enhanced performance scores compared to the 'Finetuned on 1 instruction' group, especially in the 'Visual Entailment' and 'Visual Question Answering' categories. However, the addition of more instructions past 5 does not result in further notable boosts, as indicated by the plateauing of the performance scores in the 'Finetuned on 10 instructions' group.\n\nThis visualization aids in understanding the optimal strategy for instruction tuning, highlighting the threshold at which performance stabilizes, thereby informing decisions on resource allocation and model optimization in multimodal instruction tuning environments.\n\nThe slide then transitions smoothly to discuss the 'Effectiveness of Instruction Tuning on Multimodal Tasks' again, reinforcing the critical observations made before. The emphasis remains on the empirical evidence supporting the idea that a moderate amount of instructions yields maximum benefit, rather than relying solely on extensive instruction sets. This nuanced perspective informs practitioners about the ideal balance required for achieving peak performance efficiencies in multimodal instruction tuning workflows.\n\nThe presentation maintains a structured progression, integrating analytical data with practical insights to guide users in implementing effective instruction tuning strategies.

    <sample id="282">The presentation slide titled 'Our Solution' provides a detailed overview of the proposed solution for transferring author styles while preserving content. It includes sections on discourse representation transfer, content preservation enhancing, and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.\n\nThe first section is labeled 'Discourse Representation Transfer,' which explains that the masked source story is embedded into a masked transferred story using a pointer network module. The diagram illustrates this process with a pointer network (PN) module connecting the encoder of the source style to the decoder of the target style. This ensures that the style-specific information from the source text is retained in the translated narrative.\n\nThe second section is labeled 'Content Preservation Enhancing.' Here, an ablation study demonstrates how removing certain components affects the translation quality. For instance, without the style-specific information component, the translations lose their stylistic nuances but maintain factual accuracy. Conversely, when the style-specific information component is removed, the translations retain more stylistic elements at the expense of factual accuracy. This highlights the trade-offs between maintaining originality versus factual correctness during the translation process.\n\nThe final part of the slide features two side-by-side examples comparing different translation approaches: 'Original Style' and 'Style Transfer.' These examples illustrate how the model preserves specific linguistic characteristics like sentence structure, vocabulary, and tone while adapting them to fit another language context. The comparison showcases the differences in translation outcomes based on varying levels of style retention and adaptation.\n\nOverall, the slide effectively communicates the methodology behind the proposed solution, emphasizing its ability to preserve both the essence of the original text's style and ensure accurate content reproduction across languages.</sample>

The Predicate Negations group lists errors related to predicate negations, while the Link Negations group covers issues with linking entities together. Additionally, there are examples provided for each type of error to illustrate their meanings and how they manifest in text.\n\nThe next section focuses on the content-based categories of factual errors, which include categories like Obj:Content, Pred:Content, and Link:Content. These categories describe errors that involve missing or inaccurate content within objects, predicates, and links respectively. Examples are given for each category to clarify what constitutes these types of errors. This part emphasizes the importance of addressing factual errors directly rather than relying solely on substitution operations.\n\nThe following slides discuss the evaluation framework used in the study. It mentions that training FEC models using reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yields unreliable results due to the use of factuality metrics based on pseudo data. There is an urgent need to change the evaluation methods for FEC models. Introducing human-corrected summaries during the training phase can improve performance by providing accurate feedback. Combining manually-annotated data with synthetic data is suggested as a promising direction forward.\n\nThe final sections highlight current limitations of FEC models in correcting factual errors.

The first point states, 'GPT-3 surfaces 45% of dogwhistles in our glossary, and 69% of dogwhistles belong to a "formal" register.' This indicates significant findings regarding the prevalence and linguistic characteristics of dogwhistles detected by GPT-3. The second point reads, 'It also identifies potential dogwhistles that are not covered by the glossary (e.g., tax relief, patriotism).' This suggests that while many instances of dogwhistles are identified, there are still cases that fall outside the existing glossary definitions, pointing towards areas needing further expansion or refinement.\n\nThe slide includes a table at the bottom left corner, which lists example sentences containing dogwhistles along with their translations into Spanish. For instance, it translates 'Law and order' as 'Justicia y orden,' 'The silent majority' as 'La mayoría silenciosa,' 'Family values' as 'Valores familiares,' 'Welfare queens' as 'Reyes de la ayuda social,' and 'Patriotism' as 'Patriotismo.' These translations help illustrate how dogwhistles might be perceived differently based on cultural contexts.\n\nThe right side of the slide contains another table listing terms categorized under 'Persona type' and 'Register.' Under 'Persona type,' the terms listed are 'transphobic,' 'antisemitic,' 'anti-black,' 'white supremacist,' and 'islamicophobe.' Under 'Register,' they are divided into 'Informal/Online' and 'Formal/Offline.' This categorization helps differentiate the usage patterns and registers associated with these dogwhistles, providing a deeper insight into their application within various contexts.\n\nThe slide number '71' appears at the top right corner, continuing the sequence of slides presented during the lecture or discussion session.\n\nThe slide starts with the heading 'Typology &amp; glossary with rich contextual information' accompanied by an icon of a document labeled 'A-Z.' Below this heading, there is a subheading 'Case study of historical U.S. political speeches' with an icon depicting a figure behind bars, suggesting themes of imprisonment or restriction. Another subheading reads 'Evaluate dogwhistle recognition in language models' paired with an icon of a computer monitor displaying code, indicating technical assessment. Finally, the last subheading says 'Show how dogwhistles evade content moderation' alongside an icon of a speech bubble with asterisks, symbolizing hidden or coded messages.\n\nThe slide details the process of improving GPT-3's ability to identify covert meanings by incorporating definitions and secret cues. A highlighted statement in blue reads, 'Dogwhistle definitions and secret cues improve GPT-3’s ability to identify covert meanings (8.5% → 54.3%),' showcasing a significant increase in accuracy from 8.5% to 54.3%. This improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating additional data points to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.\n\nThe slide ends with a note about the limitations faced due to insufficient training data, stating, 'However, we lack sufficient training data!' This underscores the ongoing challenges in fully leveraging AI technologies for accurate identification of dogwhistles despite improvements observed so far.\n\nThe entire presentation maintains a clean and informative layout, utilizing icons and concise descriptions to convey complex concepts effectively. The recurring emphasis on the role of definitions and secret cues in enhancing GPT-3's abilities aligns well with the overarching theme of exploring and combating dogwhistles in contemporary discourse.\n\nThe slide focuses on the topic of 'Identifying covert meanings with dogwhistles,' specifically examining the relationship between 'Dogwhistle definition' and 'Secret cue.' It illustrates how combining both approaches significantly improves the prediction rate of covert meanings, achieving results similar to those obtained solely with secret cues alone.\n\nThe central portion of the slide prominently displays the following equation:
\[ \text{Prediction Rate} = \frac{\text{Combined Approach}}{\text{Secret Cue}} \]

This formula visually represents the enhancement achieved by merging dogwhistle definitions with secret cues.

On the left side of the slide, there is a bar graph comparing the prediction rates before and after introducing combined approaches versus only secret cues. The x-axis of the graph has two categories: 'No Secret Cue' and 'With Secret Cue.' The y-axis measures the prediction rate percentage. Two sets of bars represent the comparison:

1. **No Secret Cue**:
   - Before Combined Approach: Approximately 20%
   - After Combined Approach: Approximately 40%

2. **With Secret Cue**:
   - No Secret Cue: Approximately 20%
   - With Secret Cue: Approximately 40%

The graph clearly shows that the introduction of both dogwhistle definitions and secret cues leads to a substantial increase in the prediction rate, reaching around 40%, up from approximately 20%.

On the right side of the slide, there is a line graph plotting the proportion of correct predictions over time. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 10 years, marked at intervals of 2 years. The y-axis quantifies the proportion of correct predictions, ranging from 0 to 1. Three lines represent different scenarios:

1. **No Secret Cue**: Starts near zero and increases gradually.
2. **With Secret Cue**: Starts slightly higher but follows a similar trend to the no-secret-cue scenario.
3. **With Dogwhistle Definition + Secret Cue**: Shows a steep rise starting just above zero, quickly approaching nearly 100%.

This visualization reinforces the earlier graphical representation, highlighting the dramatic effect of combining both methodologies on the prediction accuracy over time.

At the bottom of the slide, there is a concluding remark: 'However, we lack sufficient training data!' This acknowledges the current limitation in available resources needed to fully optimize the system's performance.

The slide number '72' is displayed at the bottom center, marking its position within the broader narrative of the presentation.\n\nThe slide continues to delve into the complexities surrounding the identification of dogwhistles in online discussions. It addresses common misconceptions prevalent in public discourse, particularly focusing on the idea that dogwhistles do not exist. The slide asserts that while some may argue against the existence of dogwhistles, evidence exists to refute this claim. Specifically, it references a tweet by @joshuajackman, who questions the reality of dogwhistles, implying skepticism about their presence in digital conversations.\n\nThe slide elaborates on the phenomenon of dogwhistles, detailing how individuals employ coded language to express controversial ideas subtly, avoiding direct confrontation. It cites examples where users engage in debates indirectly rather than directly confronting opponents, thereby evading open conflict. An illustrative quote from Josh Hawley, a Republican senator, is included to exemplify the use of dogwhistles in real-world politics. The quote discusses issues like abortion rights, immigration policies, and healthcare reforms, alluding to underlying sentiments masked by seemingly neutral terminology.\n\nThe slide uses a combination of textual explanations and relevant quotes to underscore the pervasive nature of dogwhistles in shaping public narratives and political discourses. By presenting empirical evidence and practical examples, it aims to dispel doubts about the existence of dogwhistles and highlight their strategic use in influencing opinions and evading straightforward confrontations.\n\nThe slide delves deeply into the intricacies of dogwhistles, especially focusing on their utilization in political rhetoric.

It serves as an essential resource for anyone seeking to comprehend the sophisticated interplay of language manipulation in political arenas, emphasizing the need for vigilance and informed analysis in interpreting contemporary political rhetoric.\n\nThe slide continues to elaborate on the implications of dogwhistles in political discourse, specifically discussing the strategy of employing dogwhistles to provoke strong emotions without directly challenging opponents. It refers to a notable incident involving Senator Josh Hawley, who was criticized for his comments made via Twitter. The slide highlights the senator's argument concerning the protection of religious freedom, mentioning remarks attributed to him.\n\nThe slide stresses the importance of understanding the context in which these statements were made, clarifying that any misinterpretation should be directed toward the messenger rather than the message itself. This perspective seeks to distance Senator Hawley from the contentious views expressed, attributing blame instead to the individual responsible for disseminating the information.\n\nThe slide also touches upon the broader implications of such tactics, noting that they serve to create confusion and divide audiences. It mentions that similar strategies have been deployed by other figures, such as former President Donald Trump, referencing his infamous comment about COVID-19 vaccines causing impotence. This example underscores the widespread adoption of dogwhistle techniques in high-profile political communications.\n\nOverall, the slide encapsulates the essence of dogwhistles as tools for political maneuvering, emphasizing the need for discernment and awareness in deciphering underlying messages embedded in seemingly innocuous language. It calls attention to the strategic use of coded expressions to manipulate perceptions and influence public opinion, advocating for careful consideration and critical engagement with political rhetoric.\n\nThe slide delves into the topic of dogwhistles, particularly focusing on the mechanism of 'dogwhistles' and their evasion of content moderation systems. It provides a detailed breakdown of how these coded terms operate and why they remain undetected by conventional moderation algorithms.\n\nThe slide breaks down the components of dogwhistles into three types: 'Dogwhistle definition,' 'Secret cue,' and 'Contextual meaning.' Each component plays a crucial role in enabling the effective concealment of overtly provocative language.\n\n1. **Dogwhistle definition:** This involves defining what constitutes a dogwhistle. The slide specifies that the word 'cosmopolitan' secretly means 'Jewish to many anti-Semitic people.' This example illustrates how a single term can carry multiple layers of meaning depending on the context and the reader's interpretation.\n\n2. **Secret cue:** This element adds a layer of secrecy to the dogwhistle. In the given example, the phrase 'Jewish to many anti-Semitic people' functions as a secret cue, hinting at the true meaning concealed beneath the surface-level wording.\n\n3. **Contextual meaning:** This aspect ensures that the dogwhistle makes sense in the larger conversation. The slide provides the full sentence: 'Jewish to many anti-Semitic people.' This complete phrasing allows readers familiar with the coded language to recognize the hidden agenda behind the seemingly innocent expression.\n\nThe slide utilizes color-coded annotations to distinguish between the different parts of the dogwhistle. The word 'cosmopolitan' is highlighted in yellow, signifying its secretive connotation. The annotation 'Jewish to many anti-Semitic people' is shown in red, indicating the secret meaning. Additionally, the original unaltered version of the phrase is written in black, serving as the literal translation of the dogwhistle.\n\nThe slide concludes with a bolded statement: 'It's easy to see why dogwhistles escape content moderation'. This assertion underscores the simplicity and effectiveness of crafting dogwhistles, making them difficult for traditional moderation systems to detect. The slide number '73' is visible at the bottom right corner, marking its place within the sequential flow of the presentation.\n\nThe slide continues to explore the intricate mechanics of dogwhistles, now focusing on their evasion of content moderation systems. It builds upon previous analyses by diving deeper into the mechanisms that allow these coded terms to bypass automatic filtering processes commonly implemented in platforms aiming to control harmful content.\n\nThe slide poses the question: 'How does a dogwhistle evade content moderation?' and answers it succinctly with the response: 'By hiding in plain sight.' This implies that dogwhistles are crafted in such a way that they appear benign or neutral to typical content moderation algorithms, thus slipping past filters designed to block offensive material.\n\nIt goes on to explain the cognitive biases that contribute to the success of dogwhistles. The slide enumerates five distinct biases that enable these coded expressions to go unnoticed by moderators. They are illustrated with accompanying icons for visual aid and comprehension. The biases mentioned are:\n\n1. **Shared assumptions:** This bias occurs when content is framed in ways that rely on widely held beliefs or preconceptions shared by large segments of society. Moderators may overlook dogwhistles if they assume the apparent innocence of the language.\n\n2. **In-group favoritism:** This bias favors content created by members of one's own group over outsiders. If a piece of content resonates positively within a community, moderators might miss out on detecting dogwhistles because they tend to trust contributions from insiders.\n\n3. **Confirmation bias:** This tendency causes individuals to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs. Moderators relying heavily on confirmation bias could easily overlook dogwhistles if the content aligns with their personal viewpoints or ideologies.\n\n4. **Social desirability bias:** This bias drives people to present themselves in favorable light. When dealing with potentially controversial topics, individuals might self-censor or tone down their language excessively, inadvertently masking aggressive sentiments with seemingly harmless wording. Moderators might fail to notice the underlying hostility due to this bias.\n\n5. **Perceptual fluency:** This bias affects judgments based on ease of processing. If a piece of content flows naturally and sounds reasonable initially, moderators might find it less suspicious and less likely to contain hidden agendas. The smoothness of the writing style can make dogwhistles blend seamlessly into mainstream discourse.\n\nThe slide emphasizes that these biases collectively facilitate the successful evasion of dogwhistles by content moderation systems. Despite advancements in natural language processing and machine learning, these cognitive tendencies continue to pose significant challenges in accurately identifying and removing harmful content.\n\nThe slide concludes with a call to action, urging researchers and developers to tackle this persistent challenge head-on. It states: 'We must develop better solutions to combat this!' This reflects the ongoing effort required to refine content moderation practices and stay ahead of the increasingly clever obfuscations employed by individuals attempting to spread divisive or harmful messages.\n\nThe slide number '74' is displayed at the bottom right corner, continuing the sequence of slides presented during the lecture or discussion session.\n\nThe slide continues to discuss the topic of dogwhistles, specifically focusing on the mechanism of 'dogwhistle definition.' It illustrates how politicians utilize coded language to evoke strong emotional responses from supporters while avoiding direct confrontation. The slide attributes this technique to the actions of politician Josh Hawley, who discussed issues like abortion rights, immigration policies, and healthcare reforms, alluding to underlying sentiments masked by neutral terminology.\n\nThe slide provides a list of specific dogwhistles, such as 'tax relief,' 'welfare reform,' and 'anti-wax queens,' noting their formal register and inclusion in the glossary. It compares the absence of informal registers in the glossary, stressing the deliberate choice of formal terminology to maintain rhetorical precision.

    <sample id="359">The video presents a detailed explanation of the EDAtt model, its performance metrics, and contact information for further inquiries. The slide titled 'Main Results: EDAtt' shows various strategies applied to offline models, with a blue box highlighting that EDAtt outperforms all other strategies if we consider the actual elapsed time. It also provides QR codes and social media handles for more details.</sample>
    <sample id="361">The video begins with a presentation slide from Carnegie Mellon University, featuring the title 'CounterComp: Metric learning using counterfactual examples.' The left side of the screen displays the university's logo and name in white text on a dark background. On the right side, there is a table comparing different models' performance metrics across various programs such as TAT-QA, HiTab, MultiHERTT, and FinQA. Each row represents a specific program or task, showing values for different steps (e.g., divide, subtract) and their respective accuracies (e.g., 41.64, 22.80). Below this comparison chart, another section titled 'Top attended tokens during the generation of divide' lists words like 'share,' 'year,' 'ratio,' 'percent,' 'average,' and 'per year,' indicating which terms were most frequently used by the models when generating certain outputs.\n\nThe next frame continues to show the same content but introduces additional details about model performances. For instance, under the FinQA model, it shows 'FinQA' followed by 'FinQA+CompaQT' and 'FinQA+CounterComp,' each accompanied by numerical values representing accuracy percentages for different tasks. This detailed breakdown helps illustrate how well each model performs across multiple evaluation criteria.\n\nFollowing this, the focus shifts to a new topic introduced at the bottom of the previous frames: 'CounterComp improves performance on OOD samples.' A mathematical equation appears below this heading, suggesting an explanation related to out-of-distribution (OOD) sample improvements through CounterComp. Additionally, two images are shown beneath this heading, likely depicting individuals associated with the research or project being presented.\n\nThe subsequent frames continue to highlight the improvement of performance on OOD samples due to CounterComp. They include references to several academic papers that discuss topics relevant to the presentation, such as numerical reasoning over financial data, question answering benchmarks, hierarchical lab datasets, neural semantic parsing, compositional generalization, and empirical significance studies. These references provide context and support for the claims made earlier regarding the effectiveness of CounterComp in enhancing model performance.\n\nThe final frames transition into a thank you message, displaying the word "Thank You" prominently against a clean white background. To the left, the Carnegie Mellon University logo is visible, reinforcing the affiliation of the presenters. At the bottom of the frame, contact information is provided, listing names Sameena Shah and Armineh Shah, along with an email address for further inquiries. Two blurred photographs flank the names, adding a personal touch to the closing remarks of the presentation.\n\nThe scene remains static throughout these transitions, focusing solely on the textual elements without any dynamic changes or movements within the frames. The consistent display of the 'Thank You' message, logos, and contact information serves to conclude the presentation effectively, ensuring viewers have all necessary information before moving forward.\n\nThe sequence then moves towards a more interactive phase, indicated by the appearance of navigation controls at the bottom-left corner of the screen. The familiar layout persists, maintaining the 'Thank You' message, logos, and contact information, while now including options labeled 'Back' and 'Next,' allowing the viewer to navigate between slides or sections of the presentation.</sample>
