    <sample id="118">The video discusses the technical challenges of aligning sequences, particularly in the context of biological data. It highlights the issue of multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but may not be linguistically correct. The solution proposed is to induce the alignment as part of the training process.</sample>
    <sample id="119">The video discusses the technical challenges of a permutation method used in a specific context, likely related to scheduling or resource allocation. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

### **1. The Permutation Method**
- The method is described as **flexible**, suggesting it can handle various scenarios or constraints.
- It involves **permuting** elements (e.g., tasks, resources) to optimize a certain objective, such as minimizing cost or maximizing efficiency.

### **2. The Challenge: NP-Hard Problem**
- The method faces a significant challenge: **finding the highest-scoring permutation is NP-hard**.
- This means that as the number of elements to permute increases, the computational complexity grows exponentially, making it impractical to solve for large datasets.
- The reason for this difficulty is that the problem is related to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, a well-known NP-hard problem in computer science.

### **3. Implications**
- The NP-hard nature of the problem implies that exact solutions may not be feasible for large-scale applications.
- This necessitates the use of **heuristics** or **approximation algorithms** to find near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame.

### **4. Contextual Clues**
- The presence of terms like "alignment unknown," "permute," "tag," and "Tag" suggests that the method is applied in a scheduling or resource allocation context, where elements need to be ordered or grouped efficiently.

### **5. Conclusion**
- The video highlights the trade-off between flexibility and computational feasibility in the permutation method.
- While the method is powerful, its NP-hard nature poses a significant challenge that requires careful consideration of algorithmic approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="120">The video presents a technical challenge related to permutation models in natural language processing, specifically addressing the issue of alignment unknown. The main points discussed are:

1. **Permutation Model Challenge**: The permutation model is NP-hard, similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This means that finding the optimal permutation is computationally expensive.

2. **Solution Approach**: The video introduces a method to approximate the permutation model using GPU-friendly continuous relaxation. This approach allows for efficient computation and backpropagation through the solution.

3. **Learning Plausible Permutations**: By using continuous relaxation, the model can learn more linguistically plausible permutations, improving the overall performance of the system.

4. **Implementation Details**: The video mentions that the solution involves inducing alignment during training, which is crucial for handling the permutation challenge effectively.

Overall, the video provides a technical overview of a method to address the permutation model challenge in natural language processing, focusing on computational efficiency and improved learning of plausible permutations.</sample>

    <sample id="123">Hello, I am Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University in Germany. In this video, I would like to present our recent work, Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning.</sample>
    <sample id="124">This is joint work with Xiaoyu Shen, Marius Mosbach, Andreas Stephan, and Dietrich Klakow.</sample>
    <sample id="125">Weak supervision refers to the use of noisy labels, which can harm generalization. Weakly supervised learning is a method that trains models to generalize well despite being trained on noisy data.</sample>
    <sample id="126">In weak supervision, we do not manually label the data. Instead, we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low-quality crowdsourcing. As illustrated in the figure on the right, we have three types of data: unlabeled data, labeled data, and weak labeled data. Weak labeled data is the data that has been labeled using weak labeling sources, but some annotations are wrong.</sample>
    <sample id="127">Answer: Weakly supervised learning is a machine learning approach that utilizes weak labels, which are noisy and often incorrect, to train models. This approach helps alleviate the annotation bottleneck by reducing the need for large amounts of high-quality labeled data.</sample>
    <sample id="128">If we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize.</sample>
    <sample id="129">weakly supervised learning</sample>
    <sample id="130" />
    <sample id="131">The claim is technically correct in that models can be trained on weakly labeled data and still achieve high accuracy. However, the catch is that the accuracy is often measured on the same weakly labeled data used for training, which may not reflect the model's performance on truly clean, labeled data. This can lead to overconfidence in the model's capabilities and a lack of understanding of its limitations.</sample>
    <sample id="132">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="133" />
    <sample id="134">The first research question is whether clean validation data is necessary for WSL or if we can use a noisy validation set instead.</sample>
    <sample id="135">Answer: Yes, clean validation data is necessary.</sample>
    <sample id="136">We addressed these research questions in our work and our findings are as follows:</sample>
    <sample id="137">second, we find that recent wsl methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly.</sample>
    <sample id="138">The speaker discusses the impact of weak labels on the performance of trend models. They explain that when there are no clean validation samples, the trend models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels. This is illustrated with a graph showing the performance of different models on validation sets with and without clean labels. The graph indicates that the performance of the trend models drops significantly when there are no clean labels, highlighting the importance of clean validation samples for effective model training.</sample>
    <sample id="139">meaning that the training is pointless</sample>
    <sample id="140">This indicates that WSL approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly, and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="141">As shown in the figure on the left, our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="142">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="143">The speaker is discussing the benefits of using clean validation samples in training models. They mention that if we decide to access clean samples directly, training on them will achieve better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="144">Answer: The right figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches, which are directly applied on the clean data, and WSL approaches, which use the clean data for validation only.</sample>
    <sample id="145">As we can see, if we have 10 samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat WSL approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="146">finally the performance improvement claimed in previous wsl approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine tuning on the clean validation samples</sample>
    <sample id="147">The Valina model, termed FTW, initially underperforms more complicated WSL methods like Cosine.</sample>
    <sample id="148">However, if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples, then ftw performs equally well as other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="149">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="150">To summarize, we showed that recent WSL approaches require clean, manually annotated samples for them to work properly, their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated.</sample>
    <sample id="151">First, we should report the model selection criteria. Second, we should use few-shot learning approaches as baselines. Third, we should always apply continuous fine-tuning (CFT).</sample>
    <sample id="152">second, use few-shot learning approaches as baselines. for example, use the few-shot learning approach to compare the performance of the model with the baseline.
third, always apply continuous fine-tuning (cft). for example, use cft to fine-tune the model continuously to improve its performance.</sample>

    <sample id="308">The important properties of a watermarking method are: 1) Applicable to embedding as services, 2) Should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings, 3) Should be covert enough to the attacker, or the attacker can remove the watermark easily, and 4) The watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process.</sample>

The slide is designed to introduce the work being presented, which focuses on extracting script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="314">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="315">The previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as making a cake, and has shown that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps.</sample>
    <sample id="316" />
    <sample id="317">The problem of constrained language planning is the challenge of generating text that adheres to specific constraints, such as grammar rules, style guidelines, or domain-specific knowledge, while maintaining coherence and relevance to the given topic.</sample>
    <sample id="318">Answer: A.</sample>
    <sample id="319">The paper evaluates the constrained language planning ability of large language models, focusing on three types of constraints: modifiers, methods, and intents. It introduces a dataset called WikiHow+Generated Constraints, which combines real-world instructions with generated constraints to assess the models' performance. The paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of current models in handling these constraints and proposes potential solutions for improvement.</sample>
    <sample id="320">The video discusses the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in constrained language planning, focusing on the challenges and limitations of using LLMs for tasks that require adherence to specific constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="321">As shown in the table, we extend the abstract goals with multi-faceted constraints for human in the loop data acquisition use instruct gpt.</sample>
    <sample id="322">We sample 100 specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="323">This table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="324" />
    <sample id="325">The semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed.</sample>
    <sample id="326">The video discusses the varying performance of InstructGPTs across different categories of constraints, as shown in a heatmap. It highlights that the planning performance of InstructGPTs varies considerably for goals of different categories, such as work, relationships, personal care, and more. The video also mentions the importance of understanding the specific constraints and goals of a task to effectively use InstructGPTs.</sample>
    <sample id="327">The video presents a method for improving the quality of language model outputs by generating specific goals and constraints. It begins with an abstract goal of making a cake, which is then broken down into specific goals such as making a chocolate cake, using a specific method, and using a specific oven. The constraints include the need for a microwave and the requirement to make the cake for a wedding. The video explains that previous studies have shown that the output quality of language models can vary greatly, leading to poor performance. To address this issue, the video proposes the idea of over-generating the desired output and then filtering it to improve the quality of the final result.</sample>
    <sample id="328">We first show constraint types with examples for InstructGPT, and obtain specific goals based on the said abstract goals.</sample>
    <sample id="329">then, instruct gpt over-generate candidate scripts for specific goals</sample>
    <sample id="330">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="331">We convert scripts and goals into instruct GPT embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity.</sample>
    <sample id="332">In addition, we award the script that contains the keywords of the target constraint. We only keep the script if the target goal scores the highest in the goal set.</sample>
    <sample id="333">With our method, InstructGPT can generate scripts of higher quality by a large margin. Our method greatly improves the planning quality, both in semantic completeness and faithfulness to the constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="334">The method involves following the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation, generating 5,000 scripts with constraints based on the method, and using the Coscript dataset for human annotation and validation. The output is specific goals with corresponding plans.</sample>
    <sample id="335">The video presents a method for enabling constrained language planning ability for smaller models. It follows the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation and generates 5,000 scripts with constraints based on the method = &gt; Coscript Dataset. Humans annotate validation and test sets, and the output is specific goals with corresponding plans.</sample>
    <sample id="336">First, we generate a set of candidate scripts using InstructGPT with in-context learning. Then, we over-generate candidate scripts with InstructGPT with in-context learning. Finally, we find the filtered script with the goal and instruction similarity score.</sample>
    <sample id="337">We will apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning, named as Coscript.</sample>
    <sample id="338">In total, we generate 55,000 specific goals with scripts. To ensure the quality of validation and test sets, we ask crowd-sourced workers to find and revise incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="339">This figure shows the constraint distribution of Coscript. We find Coscript shows high pluralism in the generated specific goals. With Coscript, we can train smaller but specialized models for constraint language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="340">Answer: Smaller models fine-tuned on Coscript can generate higher quality scripts than large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="341">We use LMs to generate a high-quality script dataset (CoScript) for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="342">We use a large language model to generate a high-quality script dataset called Coscript for constrained language planning. We hope that the Coscript dataset can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning with more complex and diverse goals and constraints.</sample>

They discuss how accuracy is measured in conversational AI, including metrics such as response accuracy, task completion rate, and user satisfaction. The presenters emphasize the need for conversational AI systems to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries, as this is crucial for user satisfaction and engagement. The third section focuses on Believability. The presenters explain that believability refers to the extent to which a conversational AI system appears to be human-like and capable of understanding and responding to user queries in a natural and intuitive manner. They discuss various techniques for improving believability, such as using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, as well as incorporating human-like conversational patterns and behaviors. The fourth section addresses Contextual Appropriateness. The presenters explain that contextual appropriateness refers to the ability of a conversational AI system to understand and respond appropriately to the context of a user's query. They discuss various techniques for improving contextual appropriateness, such as using contextual information, understanding user intent, and adapting responses based on the user's previous interactions. The fifth section provides an overview of the ABC Eval framework in action. The presenters demonstrate how the framework can be applied to evaluate different conversational AI systems, using real-world examples and case studies. They discuss the benefits of using the ABC Eval framework, such as improved accuracy, believability, and contextual appropriateness, as well as its potential applications in various industries and domains. The video concludes with a summary of the key points discussed in the presentation. The presenters highlight the importance of the ABC Eval framework in creating more effective and engaging conversational AI systems, and encourage viewers to explore the framework further and apply it to their own projects. The video ends with a final slide that reiterates the title "Don't Forget Your ABC's" and the names of the presenters, along with the logos of Emory University,</sample>
    <sample id="372">This work was done by the Emory NLP lab led by Professor Jinho D. Choi at Emory University and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI.</sample>
    <sample id="373">So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art.</sample>
    <sample id="374">The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale.</sample>
    <sample id="375">The video discusses the evaluation of dialogue quality, particularly in the context of chatbots. It highlights the limitations of holistic evaluations and suggests evaluating multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level.</sample>
    <sample id="376" />
    <sample id="377">The Likert Rating Evaluation is a method used to assess the relevance of a bot's responses. It involves a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low relevance and 5 indicates high relevance. The evaluation process typically includes a human judge who rates the relevance of the bot's responses based on a set of predefined criteria. This method is commonly used in natural language processing and artificial intelligence research to evaluate the performance of conversational agents.</sample>
    <sample id="378">The video begins with a slide titled "Liked Rating Evaluation Chat (ABC-Eval)" featuring a flowchart of a chat conversation between a user and a bot. The user rates the relevance of the bot's responses on a scale of 1 to 5. The flowchart includes speech bubbles with ratings and comments such as "Irrelevant," "Lack of Empathy," and "Self Contradiction." The video then transitions to a slide titled "Annotating Behaviors in Chat (ABC-Eval)" with the same flowchart. The user is shown annotating the chat conversation, highlighting behaviors such as "Irrelevant," "Lack of</sample>
    <sample id="379">We call this approach annotating behaviors in chat or abc eval in short. we developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature.</sample>
    <sample id="380">ABC-Eval is capable of measuring the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors.</sample>
    <sample id="381">ABC-Eval measures the number of turns in which a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant.</sample>
    <sample id="382" />
    <sample id="383">The video begins with a slide titled "ABC-Eval Behaviors," which categorizes behaviors into four main areas: Coherence, Consistency, Knowledge, and Emotional Understanding. Each category lists specific behaviors, such as "Ignoring Partner" under Coherence and "Empathetic Response" under Emotional Understanding. The slide also includes the logos of Emory University and Alexa.

The scene transitions to a new slide titled "Experiments," which outlines the methodology used in the study. It states that four open-domain dialogue models were selected, and each model was evaluated on 100 human-bot conversations. The slide maintains the same Emory University and Alexa logos.

The video continues with another slide titled "Experiments," reiterating the same information about the four open-domain dialogue models and the 100 human-bot conversations per model. The Emory University and Alexa logos are still present.

The video then transitions to a new slide titled "ABC-Eval," which features an illustration of a human head with a microphone and a chat bubble, symbolizing the evaluation process. The slide includes the same Emory University and Alexa logos.</sample>
    <sample id="384">For comparison, we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods: likert ratings on the turn level, likert ratings on the dialogue level, and dialogue level pairwise comparisons.</sample>
    <sample id="385">The video presents a detailed analysis of four open-domain dialogue models, focusing on their performance across eight key aspects of dialogue. The models evaluated are ABC-Eval, Turn Likert, Dialogue Likert, and Comparative. The video begins by outlining the experimental setup, which includes conducting 100 human-bot conversations per model. The evaluation metrics are then introduced, covering consistency, emotional understanding, informativeness, overall quality, engagingness, grammaticality, productivity, and relevance. The video highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each model across these dimensions, providing a comprehensive overview of their performance.</sample>
    <sample id="386">The video presents a detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement for different evaluation methods in conversational AI. It begins with a slide titled 'Inter-Annotator Agreement,' showing a graph with various evaluation methods on the x-axis and the corresponding inter-annotator agreement scores on the y-axis. The methods include ABC-Eval, Turn Likert, Dialogue Likert, and Comparative. The graph shows that ABC-Eval consistently has the highest agreement scores across all metrics, indicating its reliability. The video then highlights the findings from the analysis, stating that ABC-Eval behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods, as measured by inter-annotator agreement on 100 doubly labeled conversations.</sample>
    <sample id="387" />

- **Metrics Evaluated:** The study examines metrics like ABC-Eval, Turn Likert, Dialogue Likert, and Comparative Likert.

### **2. Predictive Validity**
- **Definition:** Predictive validity measures how well a metric correlates with human judgments.
- **Methodology:** The video uses bar charts to compare the percentage of quality explained by each metric.
- **Findings:**
  - **ABC-Eval** consistently outperforms other metrics, explaining the highest percentage of quality.
  - **Turn Likert** and **Dialogue Likert** show moderate performance, while **Comparative Likert** performs the worst.
  - The chart highlights the significant gap between ABC-Eval and other metrics, emphasizing its superior predictive power.

### **3. Incremental Validity**
- **Definition:** Incremental validity assesses whether a metric adds unique information beyond what is already captured by other metrics.
- **Methodology:** The video employs line graphs to show the incremental contribution of each metric.
- **Findings:**</sample>
    <sample id="390">The video presents a detailed analysis of the incremental validity of various metrics in conversation quality evaluation. It begins with a visual representation of the incremental validity of different metrics, including ABC-Eval, Turn-Likert, and Dialogue-Likert. The graph shows that the combination of all ABC-Eval metrics explains over 25% of conversation quality, while individual metrics like Turn-Likert and Dialogue-Likert explain significantly less. As the video progresses, it highlights the importance of each metric by showing how removing them one at a time results in a substantial loss of information about conversation quality. The video concludes by emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach to evaluating conversation quality, as relying on a single metric may not provide a complete picture.</sample>
    <sample id="391">The combination of all turn-level liquor metrics explains far less of the quality and fewer of these metrics carry unique information.</sample>
    <sample id="392">The video begins with a slide titled "Incremental Validity by Model," which presents a bar chart comparing the incremental validity of different models. The chart shows the percentage of quality explanations (QEs) for various models, including ABC-Eval, Turn Likert, and Dialogue Likert. The x-axis lists different types of responses, such as "Antisocial," "CS-Centric," "Impolite," and others, while the y-axis represents the percentage of QEs. The chart highlights that ABC-Eval consistently outperforms other models across all response types, indicating its superior ability to generate high-quality explanations. The slide also includes logos of Emory University and Alexa, suggesting a collaboration or sponsorship.</sample>
    <sample id="393">The speaker discusses the results of an experiment, highlighting that several challenges remain and have been precisely quantified. For example, the bots tested have common sense violations in around 20% of their responses.</sample>

    <sample id="537">Hello everyone, my name is David Vilar and I will be giving a short overview of the paper 'Prompting PaLM for Translation: Assessing Strategies and Performance'. This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate.</sample>
    <sample id="538">The video presents an overview of the Pathways Language Model (PaLM), a large-scale language model developed by Google. It highlights the model's architecture, training data, and capabilities. The video begins by introducing PaLM as a 540 billion parameter model trained on 780 billion tokens. It emphasizes the model's dense activation and the use of 6144 TPU v4 chips for training. The video then showcases the model's performance across various benchmarks, including question answering, arithmetic, code completion, summarization, translation, and language understanding. The model's ability to handle complex tasks and its efficiency in processing large amounts of data are highlighted. The video concludes by summarizing the model's impressive capabilities and its potential impact on the field of natural language processing.</sample>
    <sample id="539">The model achieves state-of-the-art results in hundreds of NLP tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="540">We conduct the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation. We evaluate translation capabilities with human practices of the machine translation community. We use the latest test sets to avoid train/test overlap and overfitting on evaluation data. We compare to the most recent WMT submissions, specifically SOTA systems using the most recent training data. We use SOTA MT metrics that better correlate with human judgments. We also use expert-based human evaluation, which is more robust than crowd workers. Finally, we provide recommendations for prompt selection strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="541">We evaluated the transition capability of such models using the best practices of the MT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="542">The speaker is presenting the results of a study on Large Language Model (LLM) prompting for machine translation (MT). The study is the first systematic evaluation of LLM prompting for MT, and it aims to bridge the gap between the community's best practices and the latest advancements in the field. The study compares two state-of-the-art systems, the best performing systems of the WMT evaluation, to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM prompting for MT.</sample>
    <sample id="543">We use state-of-the-art neural machine translation metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="544">The prompting has a big influence on the performance of the of LLMs for translation. As we can see in a simple experiment where we use one short prompting and provided two different prompts for for just a sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="545">The majority of sentences, 516 out of 1000, show a difference of more than 1 BLEURT point. The difference can go up to 40 BLEURT points.</sample>
    <sample id="546">The video discusses the significant impact of prompts on translation quality, using BLEURT scores as a metric. It explains that selecting two random prompts for each sentence and computing BLEURT scores for each pair can reveal substantial differences in translation quality. The majority of sentences (516 out of 1000) show a difference of more than 1 BLEURT point, with some differences reaching up to 40 BLEURT points. This highlights the importance of choosing effective prompting strategies to improve translation accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="547">In our experiments, we settled for a five-shot prompting strategy where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in.</sample>
    <sample id="548">so in this example uh here where we perform translation from german into english the german sentences the source sentences are marked with german colon and the english translations with english colon</sample>
    <sample id="549">We observed that the actual form of the prompting does not have a significant impact in the case of several short promptings.</sample>
    <sample id="550">It's crucial for zero-shot and one-shot prompting, and when we go, as in our case, to five-shot prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the of the prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="551">It's the examples that carry most of the weight.</sample>
    <sample id="552">The summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="553">The video discusses the importance of selecting high-quality examples for training machine translation models, particularly focusing on the use of specialized SOTA (State-of-the-Art) systems. It highlights the findings from an experiment comparing different approaches to example selection, emphasizing that example quality is more important than similarity to the source sentence. The video also notes that specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage and that PaLM (Pathways Language Model) is close to Google Translate in performance. Insights from the experiment indicate that while PaLM's fluency is comparable to SOTA systems, its accuracy scores are generally lower and are dominated by "Accuracy/Omission" errors. Additionally, the "Style/Awkward" errors in PaLM are generally lower than those in SOTA systems.</sample>
    <sample id="554">The dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data, which is more noisy, and the results show a better performance when using the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="555">The video discusses the results of an experiment comparing different translation systems. It highlights that specialized systems have a significant advantage over general-purpose ones, with PalM being close to Google Translate in performance. The video also notes that fluency is comparable between PalM and SOTA systems, but accuracy scores are generally lower, dominated by "Accuracy/Omission." Additionally, "Style/Awkward" is generally lower for PalM.</sample>
    <sample id="556">The main difference comes from the accuracy. The accuracy scores are generally lower for PalM, and this is dominated by the "Accuracy/Omission" metric. Additionally, the "Style/Awkward" metric is generally lower for PalM compared to SOTA systems.</sample>
    <sample id="557">The most common error are omission errors.</sample>
    <sample id="558">so it seems that palm chooses them to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are omitted in the translation</sample>
    <sample id="559">The speaker discusses the results of an experiment comparing different systems for generating text. They mention that example quality is more important than similarity to the source sentence, and specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage. The speaker also notes that PalM is close to Google Translate in performance. They provide insights from MQM, stating that the fluency of PalM is comparable to SOTA, but its accuracy scores are generally lower and dominated by "Accuracy/Omission." Additionally, the "Style/Awkward" category for PalM is generally lower than for the state-of-the-art systems, which is an additional signal.</sample>

    <sample id="599">Hello everyone, I'm Akshatha Arodi, and today my co-author Martin and I are presenting our work, The KITMUS Test, which evaluates knowledge integration from multiple sources. This work is a collaboration between McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research.</sample>
    <sample id="600" />
    <sample id="601">Recent works in tasks like question answering show that models can use pre-trained time knowledge to solve the task.</sample>
    <sample id="602" />
    <sample id="603">The sentence "John saw the newly elected president on TV" is an example of a declarative sentence. It is a statement that provides information or conveys a fact. In this case, it tells us that John watched the newly elected president on television.</sample>
    <sample id="604" />
    <sample id="605" />
    <sample id="606">The diagnostic test suite is designed to evaluate knowledge integration. It consists of a dataset for knowledge integration evaluation, a coreference resolution task to probe the ability to draw on pretrain-time knowledge and inference-time knowledge, and experiments with human study participants and coreference resolution models.</sample>
    <sample id="607">We introduce a coreference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources. We evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established coreference resolution models.</sample>

    <sample id="609">Answer: Servin.</sample>
    <sample id="610" />
    <sample id="611" />
    <sample id="612">We vary the availability of these two pieces of information such that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="613">Second, we have the background both setting, where background knowledge is explicitly provided during both pre-training and inference.
Third, we have the background inference setting, where background knowledge is only available at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="614">The speaker is explaining the three variants of KITMUS, which are different ways of incorporating background knowledge into a model.</sample>
    <sample id="615">This last setting is especially interesting since it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre-trained data of models. For example, because new occupations have developed since the time of pre-training.</sample>
    <sample id="616">Here's an example of how we control the availability of facts to two sources.</sample>
    <sample id="617">In the background-pretrain setting, we assume that the background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre-trained parameters. In the influence setting, we provide the anti-specific knowledge that Chichester is a politician.</sample>
    <sample id="618">In the background both setting, we additionally provide not only anti-specific but also background knowledge about politicians in the inferred context.</sample>
    <sample id="619">The speaker is explaining the different variants of KITMUS, a language model, and how it can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. The speaker describes three variants: Background-Pretrain, Background-Both, and Background-Inference. In the Background-Pretrain variant, the model is trained on a general dataset without any specific task in mind. In the Background-Both variant, the model is trained on a general task and a specific task. In the Background-Inference variant, the model is trained on a specific task and is then fine-tuned for a different task. The speaker also explains how the model can be used to generate text based on a given prompt.</sample>
    <sample id="620">We evaluated the dataset both with human study participants and established reference resolution models. In this figure, we show the results of the best performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-train setting.</sample>
    <sample id="621">The speaker is discussing the performance of different models on a task involving knowledge integration. They mention that without task-specific training on a dataset called KITMOS, both models do not perform well. However, when trained on KITMOS, both C2F and BERT4CREF perform significantly better than the random choice model.</sample>
    <sample id="622">This suggests that when trained on general question-answering datasets, models learn to exploit surface cues, which are not useful when testing on KITMUS where such cues have been removed.</sample>
    <sample id="623" />
    <sample id="624">However, with task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="625">The speaker discusses the challenges of integrating knowledge from multiple sources, specifically pre-trained and inference-time knowledge, into models. They highlight that even the best-performing models struggle with reliably integrating backward knowledge presented only at inference time. The speaker encourages interested individuals to refer to their paper and check out the dataset and code on GitHub.</sample>

    <sample id="670">Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task.</sample>
    <sample id="671">We observe that models have been using CoNLL-2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years, and this naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data?</sample>
    <sample id="672" />
    <sample id="673" />
    <sample id="674" />
    <sample id="675">We then fine-tuned over 20 models on CoNLL-2003. We evaluated them on both the CoNLL-2003 test set and the CoNLL++ test set.</sample>
    <sample id="676" />
    <sample id="677">The video is a presentation slide with a white background and a title at the top that reads "What Is Needed for Good Generalization?" in brown text. The Georgia Tech logo is visible in the bottom right corner. The main content of the slide is a speaker who is not shown in the video. The speaker is wearing glasses and a black shirt, and their face is not visible. The speaker is speaking about the topic of good generalization, but the specific content of their speech is not provided in the video. The video does not contain any other visual elements or animations.</sample>
    <sample id="678">The first one is the model architecture. Through our experiments, we found that the transformer models normally generalize better to new data.</sample>
    <sample id="679">The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually larger models lead to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="680">And last but not least, we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task. Here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also leads to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="681">The performance drop of some models is caused by the lack of sufficient training data.</sample>
    <sample id="682">The first hypothesis is adaptive overfitting, which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again, and this is usually manifested as the diminishing returns on the new test set.</sample>
    <sample id="683">The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data.</sample>
    <sample id="684">for adaptive overfitting, we saw that from the graph on the right, the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one.</sample>
    <sample id="685">This means that every unit of improvement that we made on colon 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on colon++ which means that there is no diminishing returns.</sample>
    <sample id="686">and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed</sample>

    <sample id="688">For temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data, and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap.</sample>
    <sample id="689">and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift.</sample>
    <sample id="690">Our conclusion is that for good generalization, we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine-tuning examples. And these goals hand in hands, we can't just have one ingredient, but throughout the others.</sample>

    <sample id="704">Hi, I'm Myra, and today I'll be talking about our paper "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models." This work is done in collaboration with Esin Durmus and Dan Jurafsky.</sample>
    <sample id="705">in recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models, or llms.</sample>
    <sample id="706">The video discusses the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in Large Language Models (LLMs) and highlights the limitations of existing stereotype measures. It explains that these measures often rely on hand-constructed datasets, which are time-consuming to curate, and they face a trade-off between specificity and generalizability. Additionally, they do not account for intersectionality, meaning they may not fully capture the complexity of overlapping social identities.</sample>
    <sample id="707">The video discusses the limitations of existing stereotype measures in large language models (LLMs). It highlights that these measures often face a trade-off between specificity and generalizability, are based on fixed, hand-curated datasets, and do not account for intersectionality. The video explains that these limitations result in LLMs perpetuating social biases and stereotypes, as they may only measure very specific stereotypes or capture very general, broad associations, such as negative associations with particular groups.</sample>
    <sample id="708">Furthermore, most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality, which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm.</sample>
    <sample id="709">To overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned LLMs are very good at responding to instructions in prompts.</sample>
    <sample id="710">So we can ask the model to generate a persona, which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like 'imagine you are an Asian woman. describe yourself.'</sample>
    <sample id="711">The video features a speaker discussing the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in responding to instructions in prompts. The speaker highlights the generalizability of these models, demonstrating how they can be used to describe various identities by simply specifying the desired identity marker in the prompt. The video emphasizes the flexibility and adaptability of these AI models in handling different demographic inputs.</sample>
    <sample id="712">so here are some example generations from gpt four</sample>
    <sample id="713">they are still very negative and toxic in the sense that they are perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases.</sample>
    <sample id="714">There are some interesting patterns in the way people describe themselves. For example, the Asian woman describes her almond-shaped eyes as conveying a sense of quiet strength and wisdom, while the Middle-Eastern woman describes her eyes as framing a vision of Middle-Eastern beauty. The white man, on the other hand, describes his pale skin as sometimes reddening in the sun if he's not careful with his sunscreen. These descriptions highlight the unique features and characteristics that people associate with their own identities.</sample>
    <sample id="715">The video presents a detailed analysis of three persona examples generated by GPT-4, focusing on the Asian woman, Middle-Eastern woman, and White man. Each persona is described with specific attributes and cultural references, highlighting the nuances in how different ethnicities are portrayed.

### **Persona 1: Asian Woman**
- **Physical Description:** The Asian woman is depicted with almond-shaped eyes, framed by long, dark lashes, conveying a sense of quiet strength and wisdom. Her dark brown eyes are described as holding stories and secrets of her ancestry, with a complexion that has a soft golden glow, smooth, and seemingly untouched by time.
- **Cultural Context:** The description emphasizes her elegance and unassuming nature, suggesting a cultural background that values modesty and tradition.

### **Persona 2: Middle-Eastern Woman**
- **Physical Description:** The Middle-Eastern woman is described as a vision of Middle-Eastern beauty, embodying the exotic and timeless. Her almond-shaped eyes are framed by elegant, elongated lashes, which extend like delicate feathers. Her gaze is deep and mysterious, seemingly concealing the ancient wisdom of a thousand Arabian nights.
- **Cultural Context:** The use of words like "exotic" and "timeless" highlights the cultural richness and mystique associated with Middle-Eastern beauty. The reference to "Arabian nights" evokes a sense of historical depth and allure.

### **Persona 3: White Man**
- **Physical Description:** The White man is depicted as taking a moment to examine the features that make up his appearance, such as his pale skin, which sometimes reddens in the sun if he isn't careful with his sunscreen.
- **Cultural Context:** The description focuses on physical attributes without delving into cultural or historical references, suggesting a more neutral or individualistic portrayal.

### **Analysis of Cultural Portrayals**
- **Stereotyping and Bias:** The video highlights how GPT-4 generates personas that reflect common stereotypes and biases. For example, the Asian woman is described with attributes that emphasize her quiet strength and wisdom, while the Middle-Eastern woman is portrayed with exotic and timeless qualities. These descriptions can perpetuate cultural stereotypes and reduce individuals to their physical and cultural attributes.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** The use of terms like "exotic" and "timeless," while evocative, can also be seen as reductive and potentially offensive. It is important to approach cultural representations with sensitivity and avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes.
- **Individuality vs. Generalization:** The personas in the video are generalized representations of entire ethnic groups, which can overlook the diversity and individuality within each culture. This generalization can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the unique experiences and identities of individuals.

### **Conclusion**
The video underscores the importance of being mindful of how AI-generated personas can reflect and perpetuate cultural stereotypes. It highlights the need for more nuanced and respectful representations that go beyond physical attributes and cultural generalizations. By fostering a deeper understanding of cultural diversity, we can work towards more inclusive and accurate portrayals in AI-generated content.</sample>
    <sample id="716" />
    <sample id="717">To capture these patterns, our method has two parts. The first one is generating these personas.</sample>
    <sample id="718">Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects, finding that by giving it to human subjects, they also were able to surface racial stereotypes.</sample>
    <sample id="719">This enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human written responses.</sample>
    <sample id="720">The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, which I'll elaborate on shortly.</sample>
    <sample id="721">The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon.</sample>
    <sample id="722">so the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked</sample>
    <sample id="723">The video features a person in a black and white striped shirt, seated in front of a plain white background, speaking directly to the camera. The person's face is not visible. The video is focused on explaining the concept of markedness in language, specifically in the context of gender. The person uses the example of the word "warrior" to illustrate how certain words are associated with specific genders and how this association can be marked or unmarked. The video is informative and educational, providing a clear and concise explanation of the concept of markedness in language.</sample>
    <sample id="724">The video begins with a slide titled "Insight for Step 2: Marked Words." The slide explains that unmarked groups are the default and ordinary, while marked groups differ from the default. It provides an example: "a warrior" (unmarked) vs. "a woman warrior" (marked). The slide then states that dominant groups are linguistically and socially unmarked, while marginalized groups are marked.</sample>
    <sample id="725">So in our method, we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are.</sample>
    <sample id="726">The video presents a detailed explanation of a method for comparing personas using the "fighting words" approach. Here's a breakdown of the content:

1. **Introduction to the Method**:
   - The video begins by outlining the steps involved in the "fighting words" method.
   - The first step is to define the unmarked and marked groups. For example, in this case, the unmarked group is "White personas," and the marked group is "Black woman personas."
   - The second step involves using weighted log-odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group.

2. **Example Application**:
   - The video provides an example of how to apply the method. It suggests finding words that distinguish "Black woman personas" from both "White personas" and "Man personas."
   - This involves analyzing the frequency and significance of words associated with each group to identify key differences.

3. **Purpose and Benefits**:
   - The video emphasizes the importance of this method in understanding the unique characteristics and language patterns of different personas.
   - By identifying "fighting words," researchers can gain insights into the distinct attributes and behaviors of each group, which can be useful for targeted marketing, product development, or social research.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The video concludes by summarizing the steps and benefits of using the "fighting words" method for comparing personas.
   - It highlights the effectiveness of this approach in uncovering meaningful differences between groups and provides a clear framework for implementation.

Overall, the video serves as an instructional guide for researchers and analysts looking to apply the "fighting words" method in their studies of persona comparison.</sample>
    <sample id="727">The video presents a slide titled "Step 2: Marked Words" with a beige background and black text. The slide outlines two main points:

1. Define unmarked and marked groups.
2. Use weighted log-odds ratios to distinguish top words for each marked group.

The slide provides an example: "For Black woman personas, find words that distinguish from both unmarked groups: i) White personas, ii) Man personas."

The video then explains that for the personas of Black women, we would identify "fighting words" and compare the log-odds ratios against both white personas and man personas, as these are the two corresponding unmarked groups.</sample>
    <sample id="728">The video presents a comparison of stereotype word usage in generated personas versus human-written personas. The analysis is divided into two main categories: Black Stereotypes and White Stereotypes.

### Black Stereotypes:
- **Human Written Personas:** The bar chart shows a low percentage of stereotype words, with most bars below 1%.
- **GPT-3.5 Generated Personas:** The bars are significantly higher, with some reaching up to 2%.
- **GPT-4 Generated Personas:** The bars are even higher, with some reaching up to 3%.

### White Stereotypes:
- **Human Written</sample>
    <sample id="729">However, when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon, we find very different things.</sample>
    <sample id="730">The generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words, while the human-written ones have a much wider distribution of words. The stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words "tall" and "athletic."</sample>
    <sample id="731">So really just only the positive or at least non-negative ones.</sample>
    <sample id="732">The video presents a detailed analysis of a lexicon used to identify stereotypes associated with Black individuals. The speaker highlights that the lexicon is incomplete, as it fails to capture many harmful patterns observed in earlier slides. To address this, the video shifts focus to the results from a marked words method, which demonstrates how positive-sounding words can still facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives. The video uses a bar chart to illustrate the distribution of words associated with Black stereotypes across different models (Human, GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and GPT-3.5 PBlack). The chart shows the percentage of each word in the lexicon for each model, with words like "basketball," "loud," "attitude," "athletic," and "tall" being highlighted. The speaker notes that while these words are positive-sounding, they contribute to reinforcing stereotypes about Black individuals. The video concludes by emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive lexicon to accurately capture the full range of stereotypes and their impact.</sample>
    <sample id="733">In our analysis, we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="734">The top words for marked groups include culture, tradition, proud, and exotic, which define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm.</sample>
    <sample id="735">This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups.</sample>
    <sample id="736">Furthermore, there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So, for example, the words describing Latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous.</sample>
    <sample id="737">For Asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky.</sample>
    <sample id="738">The video presents a slide titled "Results: Patterns in Top Words," which discusses the use of language in media and its impact on societal perceptions. The slide is divided into two main sections: "Othering through essentializing narratives" and "Pernicious positive portrayals."

### **Section 1: Othering through essentializing narratives**
- **Key Points:**
  - The slide highlights how certain words like "culture," "tradition," "proud," and "exotic" are used to define specific groups, often reducing them to stereotypes.
  - It emphasizes that these narratives can lead to the marginalization of these groups by focusing on their identity rather than their individuality.

### **Section 2: Pernicious positive portrayals**
- **Key Points:**
  The slide critiques the use of positive stereotypes, which can be equally harmful. It lists examples of how certain words are used to describe different racial and ethnic groups:
  - **Latinas:** Described as "vibrant" and "curvaceous," which can objectify and sexualize them.
  - **Asian women:** Described as "petite," "delicate," and "silky," which can perpetuate the model minority myth and undermine their individuality.
  - **Black women:** Described as "strong" and "resilient," which can create unrealistic expectations and ignore the diversity within the Black community.

### **Conclusion:**
The slide argues that both essentializing and positive stereotypes are problematic because they reduce complex individuals to simplistic and often harmful narratives. It calls for more nuanced and respectful representations in media.</sample>
    <sample id="739">The video presents a slide titled "Results: Patterns in Top Words," which discusses the use of language in media and its impact on perceptions of different racial and ethnic groups. The slide is divided into two main sections: "Othering through essentializing narratives" and "Pernicious positive portrayals."

In the first section, the slide highlights how certain words and phrases are used to essentialize and stereotype racial and ethnic groups. For example, it mentions that terms like "culture," "tradition," "proud," and "exotic" are often used to define groups solely by their identity, which can lead to oversimplification and misrepresentation.

The second section focuses on "Pernicious positive portrayals," where the slide lists words that are used to portray certain groups in a positive light, but in a way that can be problematic. For instance, it points out that terms like "vibrant" and "curvaceous" are often used to describe Latina women, while "petite," "delicate," and "silky" are used for Asian women. Similarly, "strong" and "resilient" are highlighted as common descriptors for Black women. The slide suggests that these portrayals, while seemingly positive, can still be reductive and reinforce stereotypes.

Overall, the slide aims to raise awareness about the ways in which language can shape and influence public perceptions, particularly in the context of race and ethnicity.</sample>
    <sample id="740">This connects to an archetype that people have called the strong Black women archetype. And while it sounds like positive at first glance,</sample>
    <sample id="741">There's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles.</sample>
    <sample id="742">The video presents a slide titled "Results: Patterns in Top Words," which discusses the impact of essentializing narratives and pernicious positive portrayals on marginalized groups. The slide is divided into two main sections:

### **1. Essentializing Narratives:**
- **Definition:** Essentializing refers to defining groups solely by their identity, often reducing them to stereotypes.
- **Examples:**
  - **Culture, tradition, pride, exotic:** These terms are used to define groups like Latinas, Asians, and Black women, focusing on their cultural or physical attributes rather than their individuality.
- **Impact:** This approach limits the group's identity to narrow, often negative stereotypes, leading to harmful consequences.

### **2. Pernicious Positive Portrayals:**
- **Definition:** Pernicious positive portrayals involve idealizing certain traits of marginalized groups, which can be equally harmful.
- **Examples:**
  - Latinas are described as "vibrant" and "curvaceous."
  - Asian women are labeled as "petite," "delicate," and "silky."
  - Black women are portrayed as "strong" and "resilient."
- **Impact:** These portrayals can create unrealistic expectations and pressure on individuals to conform to narrow standards, leading to negative health outcomes and reinforcing harmful stereotypes.

### **Conclusion:**
The video argues that both essentializing and pernicious positive portrayals are problematic because they reduce individuals to stereotypes, limiting their identity and creating unrealistic expectations. This can lead to negative health outcomes and perpetuate harmful societal norms.</sample>
    <sample id="743">More broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="744">so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners</sample>
    <sample id="745">First, we should address positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. We should also use an intersectional lens to study biases and harms, as there are many things that might be overlooked if we don't do that. Finally, we should be transparent about bias mitigation.</sample>
    <sample id="746">The video features a static presentation slide with a beige background and black text. The slide is titled "Recommendations" and lists three bullet points:

1. Addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives
2. An intersectional lens
3. Transparency about bias mitigation methods

The person appears to be giving a presentation or lecture, likely related to the content of the slide. The overall tone of the video is professional and informative.</sample>
    <sample id="747">The video features a person in a small window on the right side of the screen, wearing a black and white striped shirt, speaking against a plain beige background. The person is discussing the importance of addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, as well as the need for an intersectional lens and transparency about bias mitigation. The text on the screen lists these recommendations, emphasizing the need to understand the reasons behind positive stereotypes and to avoid oversimplifying or generalizing individuals based on their identities. The person's speech is clear and concise, and the video appears to be part of a larger presentation or lecture on the topic.</sample>
    <sample id="748">The video features a person in a small, static frame on the right side of the screen, wearing a black and white striped shirt. The background is a solid, light beige color. On the left side of the screen, there is a list of recommendations presented in black text. The recommendations are:

1. Addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives
2. An intersectional lens
3. Transparency about bias mitigation

The person in the frame appears to be speaking, but their mouth is not visible, and there is no audio. The video maintains a consistent visual style throughout, with no changes in the background, text, or frame.</sample>

The video also emphasizes the need for the watermark to be transferable to the attacker's services.</sample>
    <sample id="783">The watermark method needs to meet the following properties:

1. The method should be applicable to embedding as services.
2. The watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings.
3. The watermark should be covert to the attacker.
4. The watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services.</sample>

The first step involves injecting a watermark into the original embedding, which is then normalized and provided to the provider's embedding. The second step involves verifying the copyright of the embedding by comparing it to the original embedding. The presenter emphasizes the importance of these steps in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="790">The video begins with a slide from a presentation titled "EmbMarker," focusing on the process of trigger selection in a watermark injection system. The slide is divided into two main sections: the left side contains a detailed diagram and text, while the right side features a small video feed of a person speaking.

    <sample id="792">In watermark injection, we first define a target embedding. When a user sends a sentence to the provider's service, the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="793">The provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="794">The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. When the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="795" />
    <sample id="796">We first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset. The backdoor dataset contains sentences where all words belong to the trigger set, while all words in the sentences of the benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set.</sample>
    <sample id="797" />
    <sample id="798">The video presents a detailed explanation of the EmbMarker tool, focusing on its functionality for copyright verification. It begins by outlining the tool's purpose: to verify the similarity of embeddings to a target embedding, which is crucial for identifying potential copyright infringements. The video then delves into the specific methods used for this verification, starting with the computation of cosine similarity and L2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding. These metrics are essential for quantifying how closely the embeddings match, with cosine similarity measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors and L2 similarity measuring the Euclidean distance between them.

The video further explains the use of similarity difference and p-value of KS test as additional metrics for copyright verification. Similarity difference quantifies the deviation between the similarity scores of the requested embedding and the target embedding, while the p-value of KS test assesses the statistical significance of this deviation. These metrics help determine whether the similarity between the embeddings is statistically significant, indicating a potential copyright infringement.

The video also highlights the importance of these metrics in the context of the EmbMarker tool, emphasizing their role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the copyright verification process. It concludes by summarizing the key points discussed, reinforcing the tool's effectiveness in identifying potential copyright infringements through the use of advanced similarity metrics.</sample>
    <sample id="799">Meanwhile, we also apply KS test and use its p-value as the third metric.</sample>
    <sample id="800">We conduct experiments on four datasets: AG News, MIND, SST2, and Enron Spam. We assume the provider applies the Wikitext dataset to count word frequency.</sample>
    <sample id="801">The results on four datasets show that our embedding marker can have great detection performance while keeping great utility for downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="802">The legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="803">As shown in the figures, it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="804">That's all, thank you. Welcome to discuss with us.</sample>
    <sample id="805">The video is a presentation slide for a paper titled "Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation" by Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi. The slide features a blue background with white text, displaying the title, authors, and logos of the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. The video is likely part of an academic or professional presentation, focusing on the research conducted by the authors in the field of simultaneous speech translation.</sample>
    <sample id="806" />
    <sample id="807">The current SimulST models face several challenges, including:

1. **Overfitting**: Specific architectures are often trained, leading to overfitting.
2. **Complexity**: The introduction of additional modules to optimize performance increases model complexity.
3. **Scalability**: These models may struggle to scale effectively with larger datasets or more complex tasks.
4. **Generalization**: There is a risk of reduced generalization ability due to the tailored nature of the training process.
5. **Resource Intensive**: The need for specialized training and additional modules can make these models resource-intensive to develop and maintain.</sample>

    <sample id="809" />
    <sample id="810">The video does not provide a clear answer to the question "What is our solution?"</sample>
    <sample id="811" />
    <sample id="812">The speaker explains that the solution leverages the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output, which is the cross-attention mechanism. This allows the model to handle latency through the attention mechanism and use only one model for every latency regime. The speaker also mentions that this approach can be used with existing offline ST models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for SimuST.</sample>
    <sample id="813">The video presents a solution to the problem of partial translation in machine translation. The solution is to propose a method called "EDAtt" or Encoder-Decoder Attention. This method involves using an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms to decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to. The attention mechanism helps the model to focus on the relevant parts of the input sentence and generate more accurate translations. The video also explains the importance of attention in machine translation and how it can improve the quality of translations.</sample>
    <sample id="814" />
    <sample id="815">The speaker explains the concept of partial translation in speech recognition, where the model decides whether to emit a word based on the concentration of attention in the speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="816">The video presents a detailed explanation of the Encoder-Decoder Attention mechanism, focusing on the concept of cross-attention weights. It begins with an introduction to the Encoder-Decoder Attention framework, highlighting the importance of attention in machine translation. The video then delves into the specifics of cross-attention weights, explaining how they are calculated and their role in determining the relevance of different parts of the input sequence to the output sequence. The explanation is supported by visual aids, such as a waveform and a diagram, which help illustrate the process. The video also discusses the decision-making process for emitting or not emitting a partial translation, based on the concentration of attention towards the last speech frame. The explanation is clear and concise, making it accessible to viewers with varying levels of expertise in the field. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the Encoder-Decoder Attention mechanism, with a particular focus on cross-attention weights and their role in machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="817" />
    <sample id="818">This means that the first two words will be emitted.</sample>
    <sample id="819" />
    <sample id="820">The video presents a detailed explanation of the Encoder-Decoder Attention mechanism, focusing on how it determines whether to emit or not a partial translation based on the concentration of attention towards the last speech frame. The speaker uses a visual representation of speech waveforms and attention weights to illustrate the process. The video highlights the importance of the last speech frame in the decoder's decision-making and demonstrates how the model's predictions are influenced by the attention weights assigned to each word. The speaker also discusses the implications of the model's behavior, such as the potential for partial translations and the need for careful consideration of the attention mechanism in natural language processing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="821">The last lambda speech frames are the ones that are not pointed to by any words.</sample>
    <sample id="822">The speaker is explaining the concept of the Encoder-Decoder Attention mechanism, specifically focusing on the decision-making process for emitting or not emitting partial translations. The slide provides a visual representation of this process, showing two examples of sentences being translated.

### Key Points:

1. **Encoder-Decoder Attention Mechanism**:
   - The mechanism involves an encoder that processes the input sequence and a decoder that generates the output sequence.
   - Attention is used to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating each word in the output sequence.

2. **Decision to Emit or Not Emit**:
   - The decision to emit or not emit a word is based on the attention mechanism.
   - If the attention is not concentrated (i.e., the sum of attention weights is below a threshold) towards the last \(\lambda\) speech frames, the word is emitted.
   - This means that the model is confident in the translation of the word based on the attention weights.

3. **Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: The sentence "I am going to talk about..." is translated to "Ich werde reden."
     - The attention mechanism focuses on the last \(\lambda\) speech frames, and the word "reden" is emitted.
   - **Example 2**: The sentence "I am going to talk</sample>
    <sample id="823">If we look at the main results of a data, we can see that the BLEU score increases as the AL/AL_CA (s) ratio increases. This suggests that the model is performing better with more data.</sample>
    <sample id="824">The speaker will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs, with blue representing the translation quality and average latency.</sample>
    <sample id="825">That is the latency measure, and we also consider the computational aware average liking that accounts for the model's computational times to produce the output.</sample>
    <sample id="826">Answer: We want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot.</sample>
    <sample id="827">The speaker is discussing the results of an experiment or study, specifically focusing on the performance of a model or algorithm. The graph shows the BLEU score, a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine translation, as a function of the AL/AL_CA (attention length/attention context) ratio. The speaker notes that the model performs best when the AL/AL_CA ratio is around 1, indicating that the model benefits from a balance between attention length and attention context. However, the speaker also mentions that the model's performance is not significantly affected by the AL/AL_CA ratio when it is shifted to the left, suggesting that the model is robust to changes in this parameter.</sample>
    <sample id="828">The speaker is presenting the results of an experiment comparing different strategies for machine translation, specifically focusing on the performance of the EDAtt model. The results are shown in a graph that compares the BLEU scores of EDAtt with other strategies like weight-k, LA, CAAT, and the state-of-the-art architecture tailored for simultaneous speech translation. The speaker is likely explaining the significance of these results and how they contribute to the field of machine translation.</sample>

    <sample id="841">Hi everyone, I'm Kostya Sinha and I'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our ACL 2023 paper, "Language model acceptability judgements are not always robust to context."</sample>
    <sample id="842">Meta AI.</sample>
    <sample id="843">so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm</sample>
    <sample id="844">The video discusses the Minimal Pair Paradigm (MPP), which evaluates language models based on their ability to make acceptability judgments. These judgments can include grammaticality, like BLIMP, SyntaxGym, or CrowS, or acceptability in terms of stereotypes, such as CrowS pairs. The MPP is used to assess how well language models can predict human judgments of acceptability, which is crucial for understanding their performance in real-world language processing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="845" />
    <sample id="846">And then the hope is that the model basically  uh  puts more probability to the acceptable sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="847">The current MPP pipeline doesn't allow us to evaluate a model's acceptance towards longer sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="848">The video discusses the Minimal Pair Paradigm (MPP) and its implications for evaluating language models. It highlights the challenges of assessing model performance with long preceding context and introduces three evaluation methods: BLIMP, SyntaxGym, and CrowS. The video emphasizes the importance of evaluating models with long context windows and suggests that future research should focus on developing more effective evaluation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="849">The speaker is discussing the Minimal Pair Paradigm (MPP) and how it is used to evaluate language models. They explain that MPP involves presenting language models with minimal pairs, which are pairs of words that differ by only one phoneme, and asking them to predict which word comes first in a sentence. The speaker then introduces three different models: BLIMP, SyntaxGym, and CrowS, and compares their performance on MPP. They also discuss the concept of stability in language models and how it relates to the MPP paradigm.</sample>
    <sample id="850" />
    <sample id="851">so for example here we have chosen like a typical pair of grammaticality from the blimp dataset from the adjunct island case</sample>
    <sample id="852" />
    <sample id="853" />
    <sample id="854">The video discusses a method to test whether MPP (Multimodal Prompting) judgments vary as a function of context length, structural match, and acceptability. It uses a specific example involving a subject-verb agreement task. The approach involves selecting sentences that are either acceptable or unacceptable based on their grammatical correctness. The video explains that by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching context, one can test the model's ability to identify and correct errors. This method helps in evaluating the model's performance in terms of its acceptability judgments and its ability to handle different types of errors.</sample>
    <sample id="855" />
    <sample id="856" />
    <sample id="857" />
    <sample id="858">so this will tell us like whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context</sample>
    <sample id="859" />
    <sample id="860">okay so how does the model do so first we look at the wikipedia sentences which are completely irrelevant to the current query pair and there we find that the mpp judgements are mostly robust for arbitrary context lengths</sample>
    <sample id="861">We increase the context length toward up to 2024 for to max out OPT and GPT-2 models, and we saw here in the orange dot line the MPP judgments are relatively stable.</sample>
    <sample id="862">When we choose sentences from the same dataset, the performance of the model tends to be higher.</sample>
    <sample id="863">okay so here we are choosing or creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blimp or syntax gym dataset</sample>
    <sample id="864">The MPP judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes.</sample>
    <sample id="865">we get the best performance.</sample>
    <sample id="866" />
    <sample id="867">The speaker is discussing the impact of context length on the performance of MPP (Multi-Person Parsing) models. They mention that the effect of context length on model performance increases as the context length grows, and this could significantly affect newer language models that have larger context windows.</sample>
    <sample id="868">The match prefix affects the language model judgment significantly because it introduces a form of context dependency that the model must learn to handle. When a prefix is matched, the model is forced to consider the specific context provided by the prefix, which can influence its predictions and understanding of the sentence. This context dependency can lead to different interpretations and outputs based on the presence or absence of the matched prefix, thereby affecting the overall judgment of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="869">We then analyzed whether models are similarly sensitive to these sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="870">We find that none of these noises are actually making the model uh like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend.</sample>
    <sample id="871">basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways.</sample>
    <sample id="872">The speaker explains that when they perturb sentences in the acceptable domain, they observe a similar increase in all perturbations. Conversely, when perturbing sentences in the unacceptable domain, they see a decrease in MPP judgments in a similar fashion.</sample>
    <sample id="873">The key takeaways of our work are that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences, and that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture language models' abstract knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="874">The MPP evaluation, the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input, may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>

    <sample id="878">The prompting strategy has a significant impact on the performance of language models for translation.

    <sample id="948">The video is a presentation slide for a research paper titled "Transfer and Active Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare-Class Challenge." The presenter, Vasudha Varadarajan, introduces herself as a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University. She mentions that their work has been accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper. The main focus of the research is on transfer learning for dissonance detection, specifically addressing the challenge of rare-class detection.</sample>
    <sample id="949">We then discuss the two main types of cognitive dissonance: dissonance between beliefs and actions, and dissonance between two beliefs. We also explore the different ways in which people can experience cognitive dissonance, such as through internal conflict or external pressure.</sample>
    <sample id="950">The video presents a clear and concise explanation of cognitive dissonance, using a relatable example to illustrate the concept. The speaker effectively uses visual aids and a calm, informative tone to engage the audience and enhance understanding. The video successfully conveys the idea that cognitive dissonance occurs when there is a conflict between beliefs and actions, and it provides a useful framework for recognizing and addressing such conflicts.</sample>
    <sample id="951">The speaker explains that the second occurrence of the belief 'I don't think I could keep my job without them' justifies the action of grabbing a couple of smokes after the meeting today. They also mention that these beliefs have a consistency relationship.</sample>
    <sample id="952">The video discusses the concept of cognitive dissonance, which is defined as the inconsistency between two elements of cognition, such as thoughts, actions, or beliefs. The speaker explains that cognitive dissonance is relatively rare to find expressed in language compared to other discourse relations. The video also highlights the importance of understanding cognitive dissonance in daily decision-making and its impact on behavior.</sample>
    <sample id="953">The speaker explains that studying cognitive dissonance helps us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends in belief values and attitude changes in populations, and provides insights into how individuals and groups can change their beliefs and behaviors.</sample>
    <sample id="954">The speaker discusses the relationship between high cognitive dissonance and anxiety disorders, explaining that high cognitive dissonance can lead to anxiety disorders and that understanding this relationship can help improve mental health.</sample>
    <sample id="955">The speaker discusses the benefits of studying dissonance expressed in language for understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups.</sample>
    <sample id="956">finally cognitive dissonance is important to understand personal cognitive styles of individuals and helps us understand decision making processes better</sample>
    <sample id="957">We conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations using the dissonance-first approach.</sample>
    <sample id="958">The video explains the process of annotating tweets for a study on dissonance. It shows a flowchart with three steps: assessing the quality of the tweet, determining if it is dissonant, and checking for consistency. The annotator, identified as 'user_handle', evaluates each tweet and assigns scores for each step. The video highlights the importance of using a parser and following specific guidelines for accurate annotation.</sample>
    <sample id="959">The speaker is discussing the prevalence of dissonance in annotated pairs, noting that it was only found in 3.5% of them.</sample>
    <sample id="960">The speaker explains that they collected around 1000 examples of discourse unit pairs and trained an initial classifier on only 43 examples of dissonance. Surprisingly, the classifier did not perform much better than random chance.</sample>
    <sample id="961">Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such dataset, we are facing the problem of absolute rarity.</sample>
    <sample id="962">The video presents a method for annotating rare classes using transfer learning and active learning. It begins with an overview of the process, highlighting the challenges of annotating rare classes and the benefits of using transfer learning to improve model performance. The video then explains the iterative process of transfer learning and active learning, where the model is first trained on a small amount of labeled data, and then fine-tuned on new data. The model is then used to predict the labels of unlabeled data, and the most uncertain predictions are selected for human annotation. The newly annotated data is then added to the training set, and the process is repeated until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. The video concludes by summarizing the key points of the method and its potential applications in various fields.</sample>
    <sample id="963">The initial model was not able to capture the distance class at all, so we start the cold-start annotation process by transferring weights from closely related tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="964">The speaker is discussing the transfer learning approach used in their study, which involves transferring knowledge from two different tasks: topic-independent stance classification and debate CE.</sample>
    <sample id="965">The speaker is discussing the use of transfer learning in the context of cold-start annotations, specifically focusing on the RoBERTA-base model combined with a classifier head. The discussion revolves around training the model on a combined dataset of Debate and CE (Consonant Expansion) data, and evaluating its performance using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The speaker highlights the improvements in AUC scores when using the combined dataset compared to training on individual datasets. The speaker also mentions the use of binary classification for expansion and comparison classes of phonetic features, which are closely related to the concepts of consonants and dissonance. These classes are referred to as CE here.</sample>
    <sample id="966">We find that on transferring, the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance, with the best with AUC 0.62.</sample>
    <sample id="967">The speaker discusses the results of iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks, finding that fine-tuning the CE task followed by further fine-tuning on Debate yields a much better zero-shot performance. This model is then used for cold-start active learning.</sample>
    <sample id="968">The video explains the difference between cumulative and iterative update methods in active learning.</sample>
    <sample id="969">The speaker discusses the performance of different active learning strategies, specifically comparing cumulative and iterative update methods. They found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board.</sample>
    <sample id="970">The speaker explains the use of the Probability of Rare Class (PRC) strategy to select examples that are highly likely to be misclassified by the current model, thereby improving the number of dissonance examples.</sample>
    <sample id="971">We compare this to the other state of the art strategies that are commonly used in the community.</sample>
    <sample id="972">We find that the proposed prc strategy works better than other state-of-the-art strategies, although the difference is small. Note that the performance is significantly lower for random.</sample>
    <sample id="973">The speaker discusses the results of further rounds of active learning (AL) using two of the best strategies, which are the transferred model and the final model (best transfer model).</sample>
    <sample id="974">The video discusses the effectiveness of different active learning strategies in identifying rare classes, with a focus on the Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy. It highlights that while PRC is effective in increasing dissonance samples, it also makes annotations more difficult for annotators. The video also mentions that the cost of annotation is not necessarily correlated with better model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="975">The video presents a summary of the findings related to the use of PRC (Progressive Rare Class acquisition) in the context of active learning, particularly for rare class acquisition. It highlights the effectiveness of PRC as a simple and efficient strategy for rare class acquisition and emphasizes the benefits of cold-starting active learning with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks.</sample>

The presenter then proceeds to discuss the challenges and solutions in cross-lingual semantic parsing, emphasizing the importance of understanding meaning representations across different languages. The video continues with a detailed explanation of the XSemPLR framework, highlighting its ability to handle multiple languages and meaning representations effectively. The presenter discusses the architecture of XSemPLR, including its use of pre-trained language models and semantic parsing techniques. The video also covers the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of XSemPLR, such as accuracy and F1 score. The presenter concludes by summarizing the key findings of the study and discussing the potential applications of XSemPLR in various domains, such as natural language processing and machine translation. The video ends with a slide thanking the audience for their attention and inviting questions.</sample>
    <sample id="985">Semantic Parsing is the process of converting natural language queries into structured representations, such as SQL or Lambda Calculus, to facilitate understanding and processing by machines.</sample>
    <sample id="986">The speaker is discussing the concept of cross-lingual semantic parsing. They explain that this task involves translating queries from multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations. The speaker mentions that this is a complex process that requires the use of neural models to achieve accurate translations. They also highlight the importance of this task in the field of natural language processing, as it allows for more effective communication between people who speak different languages. Overall, the speaker provides a clear and concise explanation of the concept of cross-lingual semantic parsing and its significance in the field of natural language processing.</sample>
    <sample id="987">As shown in this figure, we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to SQL, Lambda, or FunQL, and so on.</sample>

    <sample id="992">The speaker is discussing the limitations of existing Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing (CLSP) models. These models are typically evaluated on separate datasets for each language, which leads to a lack of coverage for certain neural models. For instance, there might be only one single model used to evaluate both English and German datasets, resulting in inadequate coverage for other languages like Chinese.</sample>
    <sample id="993">We propose a unified dataset, XSemPLR, for cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations. It contains 9 datasets in various domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 natural languages in 15 language families.</sample>
    <sample id="994">It contains nine datasets in various domains, five semantic parsing tasks, eight meaning representations, and twenty-two natural languages in fifteen language families.</sample>
    <sample id="995">The video presents a detailed overview of the experimental settings used to evaluate a benchmark model. It begins by explaining the two main phases: training and inference. During the training phase, the model is trained using English data, and the English model is then used to translate the data into SQL. In the inference phase, the model is trained using German data, and the English model is used to translate the data into SQL. The video also highlights the use of Google Translate API to translate the source data into the target language before training the model. The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of considering the six settings for training and evaluation to better evaluate the benchmark model.</sample>

    <sample id="1006">We evaluate on two groups of models on Monolingual Setting. Enc-PTR: Multilingual Pretrained Encoders with Pointer-based Decoders. XLM-R + PTR, mBERT + PTR. Enc-Dec: Multilingual Pretrained Encoder-Decoder Models. mBERT, mT5. We found mT5 obtains the best performance on all datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1007">The speaker discusses the evaluation of two groups of models in a monolingual setting. The first group includes encoder-predictor models with pointer-based decoders, such as XLM-R+PTR and mBERT+PTR. The second group consists of encoder-decoder models, specifically mBART and mT5. The speaker highlights that mT5 achieves the best performance across all datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1008">The speaker discusses the evaluation of two groups of models on a monolingual setting. The first group consists of multilingual pretrained encoders with pointer-based decoders, including XLM-R, mBERT, and mT5.

This slide features a bar chart displaying the frequency of different sources of training data for language models. The chart lists various websites and their corresponding frequencies, with the highest frequency being for 'www.archive.org' and the lowest for 'www.books.google.com.' The slide also includes a citation at the bottom: 'Dodge, Jesse, et al. "Documenting the Hidden Bias of Language Models Trained on Internet Data." Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2020.'</sample>
    <sample id="1086">so language models are trained on large scale web crawl data</sample>
    <sample id="1087">The video discusses the diversity of training data for language models, highlighting that political news media are well-represented. It mentions a survey of the C4 corpus, showing that major newspapers like the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Huffington Post are well-covered. The video also notes that while some domains like sports and entertainment are underrepresented, the overall coverage is still significant.</sample>
    <sample id="1088">This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1089">The speaker discusses the mixed blessing of large language model (LLM) training data, highlighting its benefits and drawbacks. They mention that while LLMs can learn from diverse perspectives, which is good for democracy and idea plurality, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and may lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1090">The video presents a structured approach to understanding the political bias propagation in language models. It begins with a visual representation of the process, showing the flow from pretraining data to language models and then to downstream tasks. The video then poses two key questions: 1) How do we evaluate the political learning of LMs? and 2) What role does pretraining data play in such political biases? These questions highlight the need for a comprehensive evaluation framework and the importance of analyzing the impact of pretraining data on the biases that emerge in language models.</sample>
    <sample id="1091">second, how do language models with different political leanings perform? does language model political learning result in fairness issues in NLP applications?</sample>
    <sample id="1092">The video begins with a slide titled 'To this end,' which outlines the two main questions being addressed: 1. How to evaluate the political leaning of LMs? What role does pretraining data play in such political biases? 2. How do LMs with different political leanings perform? Does LM political leaning result in fairness issues in NLP applications? The slide features three boxes connected by arrows, representing 'Pretraining data,' 'Language models,' and 'Downstream tasks.' Below the boxes, there are two sets of questions related to each box. The video then transitions to a new slide titled 'Evaluating LM Political Leaning,' which introduces the concept of evaluating the political leaning of language models. The slide explains that the evaluation should support both encoder and decoder LMs and provides an example of a prompt: 'cstatement&gt; I cmask with this statement.' The slide also mentions the importance of automatic evaluation grounded in political science literature. The video concludes with a diagram illustrating the relationship between political leaning, language models, and downstream tasks, with a cartoon character representing the political leaning of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="1093">The speaker first proposes to prompt language models with different prompt formats using political questionnaires, such as the political compass test, to ensure automatic evaluation grounded in political science literature.</sample>
    <sample id="1094" />
    <sample id="1095">The speaker discusses the political leaning of various language models, placing them on a 2D grid with 'Libertarian' on the left and 'Authoritarian' on the right, and 'Left' on the top and 'Right' on the bottom. They mention that GPT-4 is the most liberal model, while GPT-3 is the most authoritarian. They also note that GPT-3 is more left-leaning than BERT.</sample>
    <sample id="1096">The video features a speaker discussing the pretraining data for language models, specifically focusing on the political leaning of different types of media. The speaker presents two main points:</sample>
    <sample id="1097">The speaker is discussing a research study on the political leaning of language models. They explain that they conducted a controlled experiment by further pretraining language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora, separated into news and social media, and further divided into their political leanings. The results of this experiment showed partisan shifts in the language models' political leaning.</sample>
    <sample id="1098">The video presents a detailed analysis of the political leaning of language models, specifically comparing the pre-trained models RoBERTa and GPT-2. The results are visualized in a grid format, with each cell representing a different combination of political leaning and source of text data. The grid is divided into four quadrants, each corresponding to a different political leaning: left, center, and right. The source of text data is indicated by the color of the cell, with blue representing original news, green representing Reddit, and purple representing a combination of both. The results show that both models exhibit a shift in political leaning when trained on partisan corpora, with the left-leaning model becoming more center-leaning and the right-leaning model becoming more left-leaning. The video also highlights the importance of pre-training language models on diverse and balanced datasets to ensure unbiased and fair language generation.</sample>
    <sample id="1099">The video shows a presentation slide titled "Results" with a subtitle "Partisan shifts in LM political leaning." The slide features a matrix divided into four quadrants, each representing different political leanings: left, center, and right. The matrix is used to illustrate the political leaning of different language models (LMs) when fine-tuned on various datasets. The video discusses the results of fine-tuning LMs on different datasets and their impact on political leaning.</sample>
    <sample id="1100" />
    <sample id="1101">The video discusses the shift in political sentiment from pre-45th to post-45th, using a visual representation called 'The Trump Card'. It highlights the polarization in language models, showing how they reflect the polarized nature of modern society.</sample>
    <sample id="1102">The video features a speaker presenting a slide titled "The Trump Card," which illustrates the shift in political sentiment from pre-45th President of the United States to post-45th President of the United States. The slide is divided into two main sections: the top section shows the pre-45th President of the United...</sample>
    <sample id="1103">The speaker discusses the political leaning of language models before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They show a chart titled 'The Trump Card,' which compares the political leaning of language models on a scale from -1 to 1, with -1 representing a strong left-leaning bias and 1 representing a strong right-leaning bias. The chart is divided into two sections: 'Pre-45th to post-45th shift,' showing changes in political leaning, and 'Reddit left,' 'Reddit center,' and 'Reddit right,' showing the political leaning of language models on Reddit. The speaker notes that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017, indicating that language models can pick up the polarization in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1104">The video features a presenter discussing the evaluation of language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection. The presenter highlights the importance of these evaluations for NLP applications that involve language models and could have significant implications.</sample>

    <sample id="1128">Hello, my name is Kayo Yin, and I will be presenting our work titled "When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-driven, Multilingual Exploration." This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Fernandes, Emmy Liu, André F. T. Martins, and Graham Neubig.</sample>
    <sample id="1129">We'll have to get rid of that mole.</sample>
    <sample id="1130" />
    <sample id="1131" />
    <sample id="1132">The video discusses the challenges of evaluating context-dependent translation. It highlights that only a small portion of translations depend on context, making corpus-level metrics like BLEU unable to capture these translations effectively.</sample>
    <sample id="1133" />
    <sample id="1134">In this work, we try to answer these two questions: first, when does translation require context? and second, how well do models handle these cases?</sample>
    <sample id="1135">To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context during translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1136">In the previous work, we introduced CXMI as a measure for context usage by machine translation models. This is done by measuring how much information the context C provides about the target Y given the source X.</sample>
    <sample id="1137">You can think of CXMI as the information gained from giving context to the model.</sample>
    <sample id="1138">In this work, we extend CXMI to pointwise CXMI, which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. We can think of words that have high pointwise CXMI as ones that require context for translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1139">Now we analyze words with high pxi to look for patterns between these words.</sample>
    <sample id="1140">and we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks uh that have been translated from english to fourteen different languages</sample>
    <sample id="1141">The video presents a thematic analysis of high P-CXMI words, focusing on part-of-speech (POS) tags. The analysis is conducted at three levels:

1. **High P-CXMI Words**: The video begins by identifying words with high P-CXMI values, which indicate a strong association between the word and its context. These words are crucial for understanding the thematic structure of the text.

2. **Part-of-Speech Tags**: The analysis then delves into the POS tags of these high P-CXMI words. POS tags categorize words based on their grammatical function, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. This step helps in understanding the syntactic role of these words within the text.

3. **Thematic Analysis**: Finally, the video explores the thematic significance of these words. It examines how these high P-CXMI words contribute to the overall themes and topics of the text, providing insights into the underlying message or narrative.

The video emphasizes the importance of POS tags in identifying and analyzing high P-CXMI words, which are key to understanding the thematic structure of the text.</sample>
    <sample id="1142">The video presents a thematic analysis of high P-CXMI (Pointwise Conditional Mutual Information) words, focusing on Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. The analysis is conducted on a dataset of English-Arabic parallel corpora. The video highlights the differences in POS tag distributions between the two languages, particularly emphasizing the prevalence of pronouns in Arabic. It explains that English lacks dual pronouns, which can lead to ambiguity in translation, and underscores the importance of context in determining the correct POS tag for pronouns when translating into Arabic.</sample>
    <sample id="1143">We then look at vocabulary items that have high P-CXMI average over all of its different occurrences.</sample>
    <sample id="1144">This slide focuses on the thematic analysis of high P-CXMI (Pointwise Mutual Information) words, which are words that have a high degree of association with a particular topic or theme. The slide is divided into two main sections:

1. **Thematic Analysis of High P-CXMI Words**:
   - **POS Tags**: The slide mentions the use of Part-of-Speech (POS) tags to identify the grammatical category of words. This helps in understanding the role of each word in a sentence.
   - **Vocabulary Items**: It highlights the importance of vocabulary items, which are the specific words used in a text. Analyzing these items helps in understanding the content and context of the text.

2. **Examples and Analysis**:
   - The slide provides an example sentence in English: "Avelile's mother was still asleep. Avelile went to school."
   - It also includes the Chinese translation: "阿维利尔的母亲还在睡觉。阿维利尔去上学了。"
   - The slide emphasizes the need for context to translate proper nouns accurately, ensuring consistency in translation within the document.</sample>
    <sample id="1145" />
    <sample id="1146" />
    <sample id="1147">The video begins with a slide titled "Thematic analysis of high P-CXMI words." The slide lists three main points: 1. POS tags, 2. Vocabulary items, and 3. Individual tokens. Below these points, there is an example sentence in English and its German translation: "She knows where we're going. I don't." and "Sie weiß, wohin wir gehen. Ich weiß es nicht." The slide also includes a list of linguistic features on the right side, such as pronouns, verb form, lexical cohesion, formality, and ellipsis.

The video then transitions to a new slide with the title "RQ1: When does translation require context?" The slide lists two sub-points: 1. Word-level context usage and 2. Thematic analysis.

The next slide continues with the same title, "RQ1: When does translation require context?", and reiterates the two sub-points: 1. Word-level</sample>
    <sample id="1148">For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tag the Multilingual Discourse-Aware or MuDA tagger.</sample>
    <sample id="1149">We can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena.</sample>
    <sample id="1150">We then use the MuDA tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the MuDA tagger has identified.</sample>
    <sample id="1151">The video begins with a visual representation of the MuDA benchmark process. It starts with a stack of documents being tagged by a MuDA tagger, which then processes the text to generate a BLEU score and a COMET F-measure. These metrics are evaluated by a robot, indicating the performance of the translation model. The scene transitions to a slide that poses two research questions: 

1. When does translation require context?
2. How well do models handle context-dependent translations?

The first question is addressed by listing two sub-questions:
- Word-level context usage
- Thematic analysis

The second question is addressed by listing two sub-questions as well:
- Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) benchmark
- Model evaluation

The video continues with a detailed explanation of the MuDA benchmark process. It starts by showing a stack of documents being tagged by a MuDAtagger. The tagged documents are then processed by a model to generate a BLEU score and a COMETF-measure. These metrics are evaluated by a human, indicating the performance of the translation model.

The video then transitions to a slide that poses two research questions related to the MuDA benchmark process. The first question is "When does translation require context?" and the second question is "How well do models handle context-dependent translations?" The first question is addressed by listing two sub-question</sample>
    <sample id="1152">First of all, when we use corpus-level metrics, uh so for blue we find that context-aware models have the best performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1153">The video presents a detailed analysis of corpus-level metrics, focusing on the performance of different models in various contexts. It begins with an introduction to the topic, highlighting the importance of context in evaluating model performance. The video then delves into the specifics of the metrics used, such as BLEU, COMET, and F-measure, explaining their significance and how they are calculated. The speaker emphasizes the role of context in improving model accuracy and discusses the challenges of evaluating models without context. The video concludes with a summary of the key points and a call to action for further research in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="1154">This video presents a discussion on the challenges of determining the best document-level translation system using corpus-level metrics alone. It features a speaker who explains the limitations of these metrics and the importance of considering other factors in translation evaluation. The video includes visual aids such as a slide with three robots labeled "BLEU," "COMET," and "F-measure," each representing different corpus-level metrics. The speaker emphasizes the difficulty in choosing the optimal system based solely on these metrics and suggests that additional evaluation methods may be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.</sample>
    <sample id="1155">The MuDA benchmark results show that context-aware models perform significantly better on certain discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion.</sample>
    <sample id="1156">The video presents a slide titled "MuDA benchmark results," summarizing the performance of context-aware models on various linguistic phenomena. The slide highlights that context-aware models significantly outperform non-contextual models in tasks related to formality and lexical cohesion. However, the performance improvement is not as pronounced for other phenomena such as ellipsis, pronouns, and verb form. This suggests that while context-aware models excel in certain areas, there is still room for improvement in others, particularly in document-level translation tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1157">We also compared different commercial systems, and our benchmark shows that DeepL is usually more accurate than Google Translate for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1158">To summarize, we perform a data-driven analysis across fourteen language pairs to identify when translations require context.</sample>

    <sample id="1163">Hi, welcome to our presentation of DEPLAIN, a new corpus for German text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level.</sample>
    <sample id="1164">Text simplification is the process of making a text easier to understand for a wider audience.</sample>
    <sample id="1165">Text simplification is the process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group, such as people with reading problems or non-native speakers.</sample>
    <sample id="1166">The video presents a detailed explanation of text simplification, focusing on the process of transforming complex sentences into simpler ones. It begins by introducing the concept of text simplification and its importance in making information more accessible. The video then delves into the specific techniques used in text simplification, such as substitution, clause deletion, reordering, and word deletion. Each technique is explained with examples, demonstrating how they can be applied to simplify sentences. The video also highlights the challenges and considerations involved in text simplification, such as maintaining the original meaning and ensuring clarity. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of text simplification, making it easier for viewers to understand and apply these techniques in their own work.</sample>
    <sample id="1167">The video presents a detailed explanation of text simplification, focusing on a specific example. It begins with a slide titled "Text Simplification Example," featuring a comparison between an original German sentence and its simplified translation. The slide is divided into two sections: the left side shows the original sentence, "Die Gewerkschaft setzt sich dafür ein, dass zum Beispiel höhere Löhne gezahlt werden," and the right side displays the simplified translation, "Die Gewerkschaft setz</sample>
    <sample id="1168">To simplify a sentence, various techniques can be employed, as demonstrated in the example. These methods include lexical substitution, clause deletion, clause reordering, and word insertion.</sample>
    <sample id="1169">We now propose our new corpus, DE-plain. Because in the recent years, there were some problems with existing corpora. So, for example, these corpora here are too small to train a text simplification model on.</sample>
    <sample id="1170">The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be over error-prone in their alignments.</sample>
    <sample id="1171" />
    <sample id="1172">The video presents a detailed analysis of the German Text Simplification Corpora, focusing on the sentence-level data. It begins with a visual representation of the corpus, highlighting the distribution of sentence lengths and the number of sentences in each category. The video then delves into the manual alignment process, explaining how 483 documents were aligned to create approximately 30,000 parallel sentence pairs. The speaker emphasizes the importance of this corpus for text simplification research, showcasing the meticulous effort involved in its creation. The video concludes with a summary of the corpus's features and its potential applications in improving text simplification models.</sample>

    <sample id="1198">The newer one. The song that's not energetic.</sample>
    <sample id="1199">The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example, by saying the name of the song is 'easy on me' or its position, the first one.</sample>
    <sample id="1200">The indirect referring expression "The newer one" is used to refer to a song that is not energetic.</sample>
    <sample id="1201">The pronouns are too similar to each other and hard to distinguish.</sample>
    <sample id="1202">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="1203">The problem is the lack of a large-scale public dataset for training conversational systems and benchmarking large language models' entity understanding.</sample>

    <sample id="1205" />
    <sample id="1206">The second bubble says, 'Do you mean 'Easy on me or my'?' and the third bubble says, 'Do you mean 'Easy me or my'?'</sample>
    <sample id="1207" />
    <sample id="1208" />
    <sample id="1209">The first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain.</sample>
    <sample id="1210">The alternative question is generated by asking the annotator to fill in the blank with an alternative question that is related to the context set by the first question. For example, if the first question is "Do you mean 'Easy on me or Easy on the dog'?", the alternative question could be "Do you mean 'Easy on me or the dog'?" or "Do you mean 'Easy on me or me'?"</sample>
    <sample id="1211">Generate alternative questions by sampling entity pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1212">The speaker is explaining the different sampling methods used in their research. They mention that as they move higher in the list, the entities become more similar to each other, making it harder to distinguish between them.</sample>
    <sample id="1213">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="1214">Answer: The second one is when the entities have similar titles, for example, two books with the name 'The Return'.</sample>
    <sample id="1215">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="1216">Chinese	when we show this alternative  uh  question to the annotators they know the name of these entities but they don't necessarily know about the entities</sample>
    <sample id="1217">Chinese	所以我们做的是我们展示一些关于这两个实体的背景知识对于歌曲我们只是显示一个谷歌搜索链接到每个歌曲</sample>
    <sample id="1218">The video is a presentation by Google Research on the methodology for annotating music. It begins with a slide titled 'Background knowledge (Music)' and explains that the goal is to gather background knowledge about songs by searching for them on Google. The presenter then instructs the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song. The video shows an example of a Google search result for the song 'Easy On Me' by Adele, with links to the official video on YouTube and Vevo. The presenter also mentions that the goal is to find information about the song, such as the lyrics and the music video. The video ends with a slide that says 'Thank you for watching' and a prompt to subscribe to the channel.</sample>
    <sample id="1219">Answer: For the recipes and books domain, we show some background text from Wikipedia. For recipes, we additionally show their images again from Wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like.</sample>
    <sample id="1220">The video presents a detailed explanation of a research project focused on eliciting expressions from annotators. It begins with an introduction to the project, highlighting the goal of understanding how people express emotions through language. The video then outlines the process of selecting entities for annotation, providing examples such as 'Easy on Me' by Adele and 'I Gotta Feeling' by Black Eyed Peas. Annotators are instructed to choose one of these entities and describe it using three to five indirect referring expressions. The video emphasizes the importance of these expressions in conveying emotions and the need for annotators to provide clear and concise descriptions. The video concludes with a summary of the project's objectives and the significance of the research findings.</sample>
    <sample id="1221" />
    <sample id="1222" />
    <sample id="1223">The language model's performance varies depending on the level of background knowledge it has access to compared to the annotators. When the model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators, the accuracy is around 92-95%. However, this scenario is not realistic. In cases where the model has access to partially overlapping background knowledge, the accuracy drops to 82-87%. When the model only has access to the entity names, the accuracy further decreases to 60%. Despite these variations, the models demonstrated domain-generalizability, meaning they performed well across different domains.</sample>
    <sample id="1224">Answer: If the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge, then the accuracy is between 82% to 87%, which is more realistic. For example, when the language model retrieves the background knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="1225">The video begins with a slide from Google Research titled 'AltEntities Corpus.' It presents the following information:

- The corpus contains 6,000 alternative questions across three domains.
- It includes 42,000 indirect referring expressions.
- The results with the T5 XL model show:
  - 92-95% accuracy if the language model has access to the same background knowledge as annotators.
  - 82-87% accuracy if the language model has access to partially overlapping background knowledge.
  - 60% accuracy if the language model has access only to the entity names.
- The models are shown to be domain-generalizable.

    <sample id="1229">Hello everyone, I'm Jenny, a first-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting my work on NLPositionality, which characterizes design biases of datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="1230">This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastien Santi, Ronan Le Bras, Katharina Reinecke, and Maarten Sap.</sample>
    <sample id="1231">so let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic content</sample>
    <sample id="1232">You might turn towards a popular API like Perspective API for toxicity detection, and this works really well if you're Carl Jones, where Perspective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances.</sample>
    <sample id="1233" />
    <sample id="1234">This is an example of a design bias where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations.</sample>
    <sample id="1235">Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences.</sample>
    <sample id="1236">The video discusses the concept of **positionality**, which is widely used in critical studies, particularly in feminist and queer academic spaces. Positionality refers to the perspectives individuals hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences. This concept is crucial for understanding how personal backgrounds shape one's viewpoint and influence research and analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="1237" />
    <sample id="1238">Do datasets and models have positionality?</sample>
    <sample id="1239">The video discusses the concept of 'positionality' in relation to datasets and models. It explains that while models and datasets do not have demographic identities or life experiences, they aggregate judgments and opinions of real people, which can represent certain positionalities over others. The video also references several studies that explore the impact of biases in language technology and the importance of considering diverse perspectives in data collection and model development.</sample>
    <sample id="1240">The speaker discusses the concept of model positionality, which refers to the inherent biases and limitations of models based on the data they are trained on. The video highlights the importance of understanding and addressing these biases to ensure fair and accurate AI systems.</sample>
    <sample id="1241">The speaker discusses the topic of whether datasets and models have positionality, referencing three key works: Blasi et al. (2022), Yin et al. (2022), and Cambo &amp; Gergle (2022). These works explore the concept of model and dataset probing, as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality. However, the speaker notes that these works do not focus on comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves.</sample>
    <sample id="1242">The speaker discusses the importance of studying model and dataset positionality in the context of NLP tasks becoming more subjective and socially oriented.</sample>
    <sample id="1243">It's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind APIs.</sample>
    <sample id="1244">so to study dataset and model positionality we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models</sample>
    <sample id="1245">We do this through our framework, NL Positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1246">First, we collect data from various sources, such as surveys, interviews, and social media. Then, we process the data using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between different variables. Finally, we analyze the results to draw conclusions and make predictions about future trends.</sample>
    <sample id="1247">The first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators.</sample>
    <sample id="1248">The speaker discusses the importance of re-annotating datasets with diverse annotators, especially when the original datasets have limited demographic information.</sample>
    <sample id="1249" />
    <sample id="1250">We then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using Pearson's R correlation score.</sample>
    <sample id="1251" />
    <sample id="1252" />
    <sample id="1253" />
    <sample id="1254">We host two tasks on lab in the wild, one of them being social acceptability. And the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry dataset and then they'll rate how socially acceptable a situation is.</sample>
    <sample id="1255">Participants compare their responses to an AI and others.</sample>
    <sample id="1256">We then compared these annotations with Social Chemistry, Delphi, and GPT-4.</sample>
    <sample id="1257">We then replicate a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task, where they'll read an instance from DynaHate and write whether they think it's an instance of hate speech.</sample>
    <sample id="1258">We then compared these annotations with Dynahate, Perspective API, Rewire API, Hate Roberta, and GPT-4. Our study amassed over 16,000 annotations from over 1,000 annotators from 87 countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1259">The speaker is discussing the alignment between NLP datasets and models, and they have found that there is a positional relationship in NLP.</sample>
    <sample id="1260" />
    <sample id="1261" />
    <sample id="1262" />
    <sample id="1263">Finding 2: Some populations are left behind.</sample>
    <sample id="1264">An example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts. We find this in the GPT-4 social acceptability task as well as the DynaHate task analysis as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1265">Chinese	so given that there is positionality in nlp what can we do about it</sample>
    <sample id="1266">The first recommendation is to keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process. The second recommendation is to do NLP research through the lens of perspectivism, which involves sharing disaggregated dataset labels and using modeling techniques that can handle annotator disagreement.</sample>
    <sample id="1267" />
    <sample id="1268" />
    <sample id="1269">After the first step, we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered. that's why in the second step we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order.</sample>
    <sample id="1270">The authors recommend that model owners should increase transparency about the bias mitigation methods because it is unclear whether positive stereotypes are a result of overly excessive value alignment or anti-stereotyping methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1271">Answer: Minimal-pair unacceptable inputs are sentences that are grammatically incorrect or do not follow the expected language rules, such as "No customer has spent any money" and "Non-stereotypical sentence."</sample>
    <sample id="1272">The authors used the following evaluation metrics:

    <sample id="1352">The video is a presentation slide for a talk on "Conjunct Lengths in English, Dependency Length Minimization, and Dependency Structure of Coordination" by Adam Przepiorkowski and Michał Wozniak. The slide includes the title, authors, affiliations, and the conference name (ACL 2023). The background is blue with a pattern of dots, and the text is white. The slide also includes a logo of the Institute of Computer Science, Polish Academy of Sciences, University of Warsaw.</sample>
    <sample id="1353">The video presents a slide discussing different dependency structures assumed by various theories and corpus approaches. It specifically highlights the structure of coordination in sentences, using the example sentence "Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie." The slide compares four different dependency structures: Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies), Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London. Each structure is illustrated with a diagram showing how the words "Lisa," "Bart," and "Maggie" are connected to "Homer" and to each other. The Bouquet/Stanford structure shows a universal dependency where "Lisa," "Bart," and "Magg</sample>
    <sample id="1354" />
    <sample id="1355">The video discusses different approaches to dependency structures in coordination, specifically focusing on Bouquet/Stanford, Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London. It highlights the Bouquet/Stanford approach as a universal dependency structure, where the first conjunct is the head of the entire structure. The Chain/Moscow approach is also mentioned, where the first conjunct is the head of a chain structure. The Conjunction-headed/Prague approach is described as a conjunction-headed structure, where the first conjunct is the head. The Multi-headed/London approach is a multi-headed structure, where the first conjunct is the main head, and the other conjuncts are additional heads. The video also mentions Igor Mel'cuk's meaning text theory, where the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. The video concludes by stating that these two approaches are symmetric, as they both single out one of the conjuncts as the head.</sample>
    <sample id="1356">The video discusses different approaches to coordinate structures in dependency grammar. It mentions Bouquet/Stanford's universal dependencies, Chain/Moscow's approach, Conjunction-headed/Prague's approach, and Multi-headed/London's approach. The video also introduces symmetric approaches to coordinate structures, such as the Prague approach and the Conjunction-headed approach, which assume that coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction.</sample>
    <sample id="1357">The speaker is explaining different dependency structures for coordinating conjunctions in sentences. They mention that in the Bouquet/Stanford model, there are universal dependencies where the verb "loves" is connected to the subject "Homer" and the objects "Lisa," "Bart," and "Maggie." In the Chain/Moscow model, the verb "loves" is connected to "Homer," and the objects are connected in a chain. The Conjunction-headed/Prague model has the verb "loves" connected to "Homer," and the objects connected to the verb. The Multi-headed/London model has the verb "loves" connected directly to "Homer," and the objects connected directly to the verb.</sample>
    <sample id="1358">The video presents a detailed explanation of different dependency structures used in coordination within linguistic frameworks. It begins with an introduction to the topic, followed by a slide that outlines four distinct approaches to dependency structures in coordination: Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies), Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London. Each approach is explained with examples, highlighting the differences in how the subjects and objects are connected within the sentence structure. The video emphasizes the Bouquet/Stanford approach as the most universal, while the other approaches are variations or adaptations of this method. The video concludes with a summary of the key points discussed, reinforcing the importance of understanding these different dependency structures in linguistic analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="1359">The video presents a detailed explanation of different dependency structures used in coordination within sentences. It begins with a slide titled "Dependency Structure of Coordination," which introduces four distinct approaches: Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies), Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London. Each approach is illustrated with a sentence: "Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie."

The Bouquet/Stanford approach is highlighted as the universal dependency structure, where the verb "loves" is the head of the sentence, and the objects "Lisa, Bart, and Maggie" are connected as a single unit. This structure is visually represented with a tree diagram, showing the verb as the central node with the objects branching out.

The Chain/Moscow approach is depicted as a linear chain structure, where the verb "loves" remains the head, but the objects are connected in a chain-like manner. The tree diagram for this approach shows the verb at the top, with the objects connected sequentially below it.

The Conjunction-headed/Prague approach is illustrated with the conjunction "and" as the head of the sentence, connecting the objects "Lisa, Bart, and Maggie." The tree diagram for this approach shows the conjunction "and" as the central node, with the objects branching out from it.

The Multi-headed/London approach is shown with multiple heads, where the verb "loves" and the conjunction "and" both serve as heads of the sentence. The tree diagram for this approach shows the conjunction and the verb as separate heads, with the objects connected to both.

The video then delves into the Conjunction-headed/Prague approach, explaining that all conjunctions are heads of the coordinate structure. It emphasizes that we get dependencies from the governor, which is the verb "loves," to all conjunctions separately. The tree diagram for this approach is shown again, highlighting the conjunctions as heads and the objects connected to them.

The video concludes with a slide that reiterates the four approaches and their respective tree diagrams, providing a comprehensive overview of the different dependency structures used in coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="1360">The video presents a slide titled "Dependency Structure of Coordination," which outlines four different dependency structures for the sentence "Homer loves Lisa, Bart, and Maggie." The structures are categorized as Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies), Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London. Each structure is visually represented with a diagram showing the relationships between the words in the sentence. The Bouquet/Stanford structure is depicted with a single root node, while the other structures show more complex relationships, including multiple branches and nodes. The video aims to introduce and compare these different dependency structures in the context of coordination in natural language processing.</sample>
    <sample id="1361">The argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization, which will be explained using the examples provided.</sample>
    <sample id="1362">The speaker explains that in English, direct objects tend to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away. They provide an example sentence, "March read it yesterday," to illustrate this point.</sample>
    <sample id="1363">The English content in the video can be summarized as follows:</sample>
    <sample id="1364">The video discusses the concept of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) in natural language processing, focusing on how word order affects dependency lengths in sentences. It explains that DLM tends to minimize dependency lengths, meaning that words that are closer in meaning are placed closer together in the sentence. The video provides examples of sentences with different word orders and their corresponding dependency trees, showing how the word order affects the dependency lengths. It also discusses how the effect of DLM can be mitigated when the direct object is very heavy and very long, as it can be moved to the position after the adjunct.</sample>

    <sample id="1368">The video presents a detailed explanation of the Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) principle in natural language processing, focusing on how word order affects dependency lengths in sentences. The speaker, dressed in a black shirt, stands in front of a screen displaying a slide titled "Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)." The slide features a diagram illustrating the structure of sentences with varying word orders and their corresponding dependency lengths. The speaker explains that DLM is a principle that favors shorter dependencies, meaning that words closer to the main verb are preferred over those further away. This principle is demonstrated through examples of sentences with different word orders, such as "Marge read it yesterday" and "Marge read yesterday it," showing how the dependency length changes with word order. The speaker emphasizes that DLM is a key factor in determining the structure of sentences and that it helps in understanding the relationships between words in a sentence. The video also highlights the importance of DLM in natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization, where the correct word order is crucial for accurate interpretation. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the DLM principle and its significance in natural language processing.</sample>
    <sample id="1369">The speaker is explaining the concept of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) in the context of natural language processing. They are using two tree structures to illustrate how word order can affect the length of dependencies in a sentence. The trees show the relationships between words in two different sentences, with the length of the dependencies being minimized. The speaker is highlighting the importance of word order in determining the structure of a sentence and how it can impact the meaning of the sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="1370">The video presents a detailed explanation of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) in the context of natural language processing. It begins with a visual representation of a sentence structure, highlighting the dependency from the word "read" to the object "it" and the adverb "yesterday." The speaker explains that DLM aims to minimize the length of dependencies in a sentence, which is crucial for efficient parsing and understanding.

The video then introduces a more complex sentence structure, showing a dependency from "read" to an adverbial phrase "absolutely fascinating book about bees yesterday." The speaker notes that this sentence has a dependency length of 11 words, which is longer than the previous example. The visual representation emphasizes the length of the dependency path, illustrating the concept of dependency length.

The speaker further elaborates on the importance of minimizing dependency length, explaining that shorter dependencies are easier to process and understand. They highlight that DLM helps in reducing the complexity of sentence structures, making it easier for natural language processing algorithms to analyze and interpret the meaning of sentences.

The video concludes with a summary of the key points discussed, emphasizing the significance of Dependency Length Minimization in improving the efficiency and accuracy of natural language processing tasks.

    <sample id="1372">okay so what we did we extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the penn treebank and see the paper why we didn't use universal dependencies</sample>
    <sample id="1373">The statistics confirm the observation that left conjuncts tend to be shorter.</sample>
    <sample id="1374">The video features a speaker discussing statistical observations about the length of conjunctions in English. The speaker references studies by Marcus et al. (1993) and Ficler and Goldberg (2010), highlighting that left conjunctions tend to be shorter than right conjunctions. Additionally, the speaker notes that this tendency increases with the length difference between the two conjuncts. Examples are provided to illustrate these points, such as the sentence "I saw Bert and Lisa Hone come and sneeze," where the left conjunction "and" is shorter than the right conjunction "sneeze." The speaker also mentions that this pattern is not always consistent, as seen in the sentence "Ted and Ned laughed." Overall, the video provides insights into the patterns of conjunction length in English, drawing on statistical evidence and examples.</sample>
    <sample id="1375">right so the proportion is is is bigger of of the left uh short conjunctions</sample>
    <sample id="1376">The novelty in this paper lies in the observation that the tendency for left conjuncts to be shorter than right conjuncts only occurs when the governor is on the left or absent. This is a new finding that builds upon previous research, which showed that left conjuncts tend to be shorter than right conjuncts in general. The paper provides evidence that this tendency is not universal, but rather depends on the position of the governor in the sentence. This finding has implications for our understanding of the structure of English sentences and the role of the governor in coordinating conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1377">The governor is on the left in this example.</sample>
    <sample id="1378">The left conjunct tends to be shorter when the governor is on the left or absent, as seen in the example "I saw Bart and Lisa. Homer came and sneezed." In contrast, when the governor is on the right, the left conjunct is longer, as in "I saw Bart and Ned laugh." This suggests that the left conjunct prefers to be shorter when the governor is on the right, and the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts, the longer the left conjunct tends to be.</sample>
    <sample id="1379">The video discusses the statistical analysis of conjunction lengths in English, focusing on how the position of the governor affects the coordination of conjunctions. It highlights that left conjunctions tend to be shorter, especially when the governor is on the left, but this effect disappears when the governor is on the right. The video uses data from the Penn Treebank and visualizes the findings with graphs.</sample>
    <sample id="1380">The video features a speaker discussing the relationship between the length of words and the length of their right-hand gestures. The speaker explains that by measuring the length of words in characters, the first column represents characters, the middle column represents syllables, and the right column represents words. The speaker then focuses on the right column, which represents words.</sample>
    <sample id="1381">what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left</sample>
    <sample id="1382">The tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words, and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences, but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1383">The video discusses the compatibility of different dependency structures of coordination with the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework. It presents four examples of coordination structures: Bouquet/Stanford, Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London. The video explains that the Bouquet/Stanford structure is incompatible with UD, while the other three structures are compatible. The video also highlights the importance of symmetry in dependency structures and argues against asymmetric structures.</sample>

    <sample id="1496">Our conclusion is that for good generalization, we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine-tuning examples. And these goals hand in hand, we can't just have one ingredient, but throughout the others. At the same time, we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift, and kind of surprisingly, it is not caused by adaptive overfitting. Even though ConNLL 2003 has been used for over 20 years, so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper, do ConNLL 2003 taggers still work in 2023? And we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes. We hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalizations of the models.</sample>

    <sample id="1535">In this work, we aim to explore whether instruction tuning on multimodal pre-trained models can effectively enhance generalization to unseen multimodal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1536">additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in the availability of instruction dataset between nlp and multimodal.</sample>
    <sample id="1537" />
    <sample id="1538">The first multimodal instruction tuning benchmark dataset, MultiInstruct, consists of 62 diverse multimodal tasks, covering 10 broad categories. It includes 5 expert-written instructions and is designed to evaluate the performance of multimodal instruction tuning models.</sample>
    <sample id="1539">The tasks are derived from 21 existing open-source datasets, and each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1540">For investigating multi-modal instruction tuning on our proposed dataset, we take OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as our base model. OFA uses a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens, and the coordinates of a bounding box.</sample>
    <sample id="1541">okay</sample>
    <sample id="1542" />
    <sample id="1543">We follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format, in which the input text, images, instruction, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space.</sample>
    <sample id="1544">okay now i'm gonna talk about multi model instruction tuning</sample>
    <sample id="1545">For the training dataset, we use 53 tasks from 9 groups for training and sample 10,000 instances per task. For the testing dataset, we reserve the entire Commonsense Reasoning group for testing and select additional 5 tasks from VQA and Miscellaneous groups. We randomly sample 20 tasks from the test split of the Natural Instructions dataset as unseen tasks for NLP.</sample>
    <sample id="1546" />
    <sample id="1547">The video provides a detailed explanation of the implementation details for a specific task, likely related to machine learning or natural language processing. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

### **Training Details:**
- **Model Used:** A pre-trained OFA-Large model with 472M parameters.
- **Data Preparation:** All instances are mixed together for all tasks.
- **Instance Combination:** Each instance is randomly combined with one of five instruction templates.

### **Testing Details:**
- **Experiment Setup:** For each task, five experiments are conducted.
- **Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using one of the five instructions in each experiment.
- **Performance Metrics:** The mean, maximum, and standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments are reported.

### **Purpose:**
The video aims to explain the methodology used for training and testing a model, emphasizing the use of a pre-trained model, data mixing, and random instance-instruction combinations to ensure robust evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="1548">For each task, we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment. We report the mean and maximum performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1549">We report the mean and maximum performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1550">For multi-modal classification tasks (Visual Entailment, Visual Spatial Reasoning, Natural Language Visual Reasoning, and Disaster Type Classification), we report the Accuracy. For multi-modal generation tasks (Commonsense VQA, Text VQA, Grounded VQA, Visual Text Extraction, and Visual Dialogue), we report the Rouge-L. For NLP tasks, we report Rouge-L as well. We also compute the aggregated performance for each model based on the mean of the model's performance on all multimodal and NLP unseen tasks. We use Rouge-L as the performance score for most tasks, and Accuracy that only have accuracy as a metric.</sample>
    <sample id="1551">We also introduced an additional evaluation metric called sensitivity, which measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task, regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction.</sample>
    <sample id="1552">This video presents the main results of a study on the effectiveness of instruction tuning on multi-model tasks. The study compares the performance of different models, including O</sample>
    <sample id="1553" />
    <sample id="1554">As the amount of task increase, the model achieves better performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1555">So we also did one experiment, we use one instruction versus five instruction. As we can see, using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot.</sample>
    <sample id="1556">The video presents a detailed analysis of the impact of fine-tuning strategies on model sensitivity, specifically focusing on the effect of instruction tuning on Multitask and transfer learning from the Natural Instructions dataset. The presenter begins by explaining that the model's sensitivity to unseen evaluation tasks is a critical factor in assessing its performance. The video then highlights that instruction tuning on Multitask can significantly reduce the sensitivity of the model, as shown in the first bullet point. This is followed by the second bullet point, which states that transfer learning from the Natural Instructions dataset can further reduce the sensitivity of the model. The presenter then introduces Figure 4, which illustrates the model sensitivity on unseen evaluation tasks. The figure shows that the model sensitivity decreases as the number of fine-tuning steps increases, with the Natural Instructions dataset achieving the lowest sensitivity. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of fine-tuning strategies on model</sample>
    <sample id="1557">The video presents a detailed analysis of the performance of various models on zero-shot NLP tasks, focusing on the effectiveness of instruction tuning and transfer learning strategies. It begins by highlighting the performance of different models, including OFA, OFA-Large, and others, on the Natural Instructions dataset. The results show that instruction tuning on Multilnstruct can improve zero-shot performance on unseen NLP tasks, while the transfer learning strategy Mixedlnstruct can best preserve the zero-shot capability gained on the Natural Instructions dataset. The video then delves into the specific performance metrics, showing that the best performance is achieved by the Mixedlnstruct strategy, with scores of 43.41 and 43.32 on the Natural Instructions dataset. The video also discusses the potential of transfer learning from the Natural Instructions dataset to improve performance on other datasets, such as the Natural Instruct dataset, where the OFA-Large model achieves a score of 12.18. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the performance of various models on zero-shot</sample>
    <sample id="1558">The video presents a conclusion slide summarizing the key points of the research. It highlights the creation of the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset, which significantly enhances the zero-shot capability of OFA (Open-Full-AI). The slide also mentions the exploration of various transfer learning techniques and their benefits, as well as the design of a new metric called sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1559">The speaker is announcing the collection of a much larger multimodal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional vision-language tasks. They will release these soon and provide a QR code for more information.</sample>
