    <sample id="96">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="97">A popular method to address this is to integrate trees into the models.</sample>
    <sample id="98">The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with the logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="99">This works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow.</sample>
    <sample id="100">This slide discusses the challenges and processes involved in obtaining trees from logical forms. It highlights the complexity and computational expense of this task, particularly the need for pre-processing logical forms to handle variable symbols.</sample>
    <sample id="101">The video discusses the importance of obtaining trees in natural language processing (NLP) and the methods involved in acquiring these trees. It highlights the role of trees in representing syntactic structures and the necessity of pre/post-processing logical forms and grammar-induction procedures to obtain these trees. The video also mentions the use of treebanks, which are collections of annotated trees, as a valuable resource for training NLP models.</sample>

    <sample id="117">Second of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data. As a consequence, for a given token, we don't know which multi-set it came from, which poses a challenge for training.</sample>
    <sample id="118">In addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data, but the linguistically correct one is latent. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training.</sample>
    <sample id="119">The video discusses the technical challenges of a permutation method used in a specific context, likely related to scheduling or resource allocation. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

### **1. The Permutation Method**
- The method is described as **flexible**, suggesting it can handle various scenarios or constraints.
- It involves **permuting** (rearranging) elements, such as tasks, resources, or time slots, to optimize a certain objective (e.g., minimizing cost, maximizing efficiency).

### **2. The Challenge: NP-Hard Problem**
- The main technical challenge highlighted is that **finding the highest-scoring permutation is NP-hard**.
- NP-hard problems are computationally difficult, meaning there is no known efficient algorithm to solve them for all possible inputs.
- This difficulty arises because the problem is related to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, a well-known NP-hard problem in computer science.

### **3. Why It's NP-Hard**
- The permutation method involves exploring all possible arrangements of elements to find the optimal solution.
- As the number of elements increases, the number of possible permutations grows exponentially, making it computationally infeasible to solve for large inputs.

### **4. Implications**
- The NP-hard nature of the problem means that for large-scale applications, exact solutions may not be feasible.
- Alternative approaches, such as **heuristics** or **approximation algorithms**, are often used to find near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time.

### **5. Contextual Clues**
- The presence of terms like "alignment unknown," "permute," "tag," and "Tag" suggests that the method is used in a scheduling or resource allocation context, possibly in fields like logistics, manufacturing, or project management.

### **Conclusion**
The video emphasizes the computational complexity of the permutation method, highlighting its flexibility but also its limitations due to the NP-hard nature of the underlying problem. This sets the stage for exploring alternative approaches to address these challenges in practical applications.</sample>
    <sample id="120">The video presents a technical challenge related to permutation models in natural language processing, specifically addressing the issue of alignment unknown. It explains that permutation inference is NP-hard, similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and introduces a method involving continuous relaxation to backpropagate through the solution. This approach allows the model to learn more linguistically plausible permutations by inducing alignment during training.</sample>

    <sample id="122">Our framework works in two main steps. The first step is to reannotate datasets with diverse annotators, and we opt to do this over looking at the demographics of original datasets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared. And so we opt to reannotate data to get many annotators per instance and to get a rich set of demographic data. We then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using a pearson's r correlation score. And thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and datasets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions.</sample>
    <sample id="123">Hello, I am Dawei Zhu, a PhD student at Saarland University in Germany. In this video, I would like to present our recent work, Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning.</sample>
    <sample id="124">This is joint work with Xiaoyu Shen, Marius Mosbach, Andreas Stephan, and Dietrich Klakow.</sample>
    <sample id="125">Weak supervision refers to the use of noisy labels, which are labels that are not accurate or reliable, to train machine learning models. This approach can help alleviate the annotation bottleneck, which is the problem of having to manually label large amounts of data for training. However, weak labels can also lead to noise memorization, which can harm the generalization of the model. Weakly supervised learning is a technique that aims to train models that can generalize well despite being trained on noisy data.</sample>
    <sample id="126">In weak supervision, we do not manually label the data. Instead, we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low-quality crowd sourcing. As illustrated in the figure on the right, we have three types of data: unlabeled data, labeled data, and weak labeled data. Weak labeled data is the data that has been labeled using weak labeling sources, but some of the annotations are wrong.</sample>
    <sample id="127">When compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect.</sample>
    <sample id="128">If we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize.</sample>
    <sample id="129">weakly supervised learning</sample>
    <sample id="130">Chinese	in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning a common claim is that people say that they only train models on the weakly labeled data and achieve high performance on clean test sets</sample>
    <sample id="131">The claim is technically correct in that models can be trained on weakly labeled data and still achieve high accuracy. However, the catch is that the accuracy is often measured on the same weakly labeled data used for training, which can lead to overfitting and does not reflect the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.</sample>
    <sample id="132">The common claim in recent weakly supervised learning (WSL) works is that people assume there is an additional clean validation set available for model selection.</sample>
    <sample id="133" />
    <sample id="134">The first research question is whether clean validation data is necessary for WSL or if we can use a noisy validation set instead.</sample>
    <sample id="135">Answer: The video does not provide a specific answer to this question.</sample>
    <sample id="136">We addressed these research questions in our work, and our findings are as follows:</sample>
    <sample id="137">second, we find that recent wsl methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly.</sample>
    <sample id="138">The speaker discusses the impact of weak labels on the performance of trend models. They explain that when there are no clean validation samples, the trend models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels. This is illustrated with a graph showing the performance of different models on validation sets with and without clean labels. The graph indicates that models trained on weak labels alone perform poorly on clean validation sets, while models trained on clean labels perform well. The speaker emphasizes the importance of clean labels for effective trend modeling.</sample>
    <sample id="139">meaning that the training is pointless</sample>
    <sample id="140">This indicates that WSL approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly, and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="141">The second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="142" />
    <sample id="143">But that's not the end of the story, because if we either way decide to access clean samples, then training on them directly will even achieve better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="144">The right figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches, which are directly applied on the clean data, and WSL approaches, which use the clean data for validation only.</sample>
    <sample id="145">As we can see, if we have 10 samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat WSL approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="146">Finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="147">The Valina model, termed FTW, initially underperforms more complicated WSL methods like Cosine.</sample>
    <sample id="148">However, if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples, then ftw performs equally well as other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="149">In practice, there's no reason to choose more complex WSL methods which require more computation time and disk space.</sample>
    <sample id="150">To summarize, we showed that recent WSL approaches require clean, manually annotated samples for them to work properly, their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated.</sample>
    <sample id="151">First, we need to report the model selection criteria. Second, we should use few-shot learning approaches as baselines. Third, we always apply continuous fine-tuning (CFT).</sample>
    <sample id="152">second, use few-shot learning approaches as baselines. for example, use the few-shot learning approach to compare the performance of the model with the baseline.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Second, WSL approaches should be compared with few-shot learning baselines, as both work on clean samples. Third, continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL.</sample>

    <sample id="313">Hi, I'm Siyuan Yuan from Fudan University. I'm here to introduce our work, 'Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning'.</sample>
    <sample id="314">Answer: C</sample>
    <sample id="315">The previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as making a cake, and has shown that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps.</sample>
    <sample id="316">However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities. Planning for the goals with specific constraints, such as making a chocolate cake, still remains understudied.</sample>
    <sample id="317">The problem of constrained language planning is the challenge of generating text that adheres to specific constraints, such as grammar rules, style guidelines, or domain-specific knowledge, while maintaining coherence and relevance to the given topic.</sample>
    <sample id="318">Answer: A.</sample>
    <sample id="319">We first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="320">The video discusses the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Constrained Language Planning, focusing on the challenges and limitations of using LLMs for this task. The video highlights the lack of specific datasets and goals to support the study, emphasizing the need for more targeted research in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="321">The video discusses the process of acquiring goals and extending them with multi-faceted constraints. It also mentions using InstructGPT for human-in-the-loop data acquisition.</sample>
    <sample id="322">We sample 100 specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="323">This table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="324" />
    <sample id="325">The semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed.</sample>
    <sample id="326">We delve into more fine-grained topic categories of constraints defined in wikihow. The heatmap in the figure shows that the planning performance of InstructGPTs varies considerably for goals of different categories.</sample>
    <sample id="327">The video presents a method for improving the quality of language model outputs by generating specific goals and constraints. It begins with an abstract goal of making a cake, which is then broken down into specific goals such as making a chocolate cake, using a microwave, and making a cake for a wedding. The method involves generating these goals and constraints using InstructGPT, a language model, and then using them to improve the quality of the output. The video also discusses the problem of high variance in the output quality of language models and how the proposed method can help address this issue.</sample>
    <sample id="328">We first show constraint types with examples for InstructGPT and obtain specific goals based on the set abstract goals.</sample>
    <sample id="329">then instruct gpt overgenerates k scripts for specific goals</sample>
    <sample id="330">A filter model is developed to select the feasible scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="331">We convert scripts and goals into instruct GPT embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity.</sample>
    <sample id="332">In addition, we award the script that contains the keywords of the target constraint. We only keep the script if the target goal scores the highest in the goal set.</sample>
    <sample id="333">With our method, InstructGPT can generate scripts of higher quality by a large margin. Our method greatly improves the planning quality, both in semantic completeness and faithfulness to the constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="334">The motivation behind the research is to enable language planning ability for smaller and specialized models.</sample>
    <sample id="335">The video presents a comprehensive overview of a research project focused on enhancing language planning capabilities for smaller models using a method called Script Distillation from LLMs. The video begins with an introduction to the motivation behind the research, which is to enable constrained language planning for smaller models. The method involves generating 5,000 scripts with constraints based on the Coscript Dataset, which is then annotated by humans to validate and test the scripts. The output of this process is specific plans corresponding to the goals. The video highlights the challenges of previous studies, which did not enable planning for specific goals and required expensive manual dataset annotation. The video then explains the three steps involved in the method: generating candidate scripts with constraints, over-generating candidate scripts with InstructGPT, and finding the filtered script with InstructGPT via in-context learning. The video concludes with a summary of the research and its potential applications.</sample>
    <sample id="336">First, we generate a set of candidate scripts using InstructGPT with in-context learning. Then, we over-generate candidate scripts with InstructGPT with in-context learning. Finally, we find the filtered script with the goal and instruction similarity score.</sample>
    <sample id="337">We will apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning, named as Coscript.</sample>
    <sample id="338">In total, we generate 55,000 specific goals with scripts. To ensure the quality of validation and test sets, we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="339">This figure shows the constraint distribution of Coscript. We find Coscript shows high pluralism in the generated specific goals. With Coscript, we can train smaller but specialized models for constraint language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="340">We find that T5 fine-tuned on Coscript can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models, indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="341">We use LMs to generate a high-quality script dataset (CoScript) for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="342">We use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset, called Coscript, for constrained language planning. We hope that the Coscript dataset can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning with more complex and diverse goals and constraints.</sample>

    <sample id="371">The video features a presentation by James Finch and Sarah Finch, who introduce themselves and discuss their research on a new approach to evaluating conversational AI called ABC-Eval. They explain that ABC-Eval is a multi-dimensional evaluation method that considers various aspects of conversational AI, such as user satisfaction, task completion, and naturalness. The presenters highlight the importance of evaluating conversational AI in a comprehensive manner, as traditional evaluation methods may not capture the full range of user experiences. They also discuss the challenges of evaluating conversational AI, such as the variability of user interactions and the difficulty of measuring subjective aspects of user experience. Overall, the video provides an overview of ABC-Eval and its potential to improve the evaluation of conversational AI systems.</sample>

    <sample id="373">So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art.</sample>
    <sample id="374">The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale.</sample>
    <sample id="375">The video discusses the evaluation of dialogue quality, particularly in the context of chatbots. It highlights the limitations of holistic evaluations and suggests evaluating multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level.</sample>
    <sample id="376">One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or likert scale methods.</sample>
    <sample id="377">The Likert Rating Evaluation is a method used to assess the relevance of a bot's responses. It involves a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low relevance and 5 indicates high relevance. The evaluation process typically includes a human judge who rates the responses based on their relevance to the conversation. This method is used to gather data on the effectiveness of the bot's responses and to identify areas for improvement.</sample>
    <sample id="378">The approach aims to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself.</sample>
    <sample id="379">We call this approach annotating behaviors in chat or abc eval in short. We developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature.</sample>
    <sample id="380">ABC-Eval is capable of measuring the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors.</sample>

    <sample id="383">The video is about evaluating the effectiveness of different chat models. The presenter explains that they selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human-bot conversations per model using a tool called ABC-Eval. The video provides an overview of the evaluation process and the results of the study.</sample>
    <sample id="384">For comparison, we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods: likert ratings on the turn level, likert ratings on the dialogue level, and dialogue level pairwise comparisons.</sample>
    <sample id="385">For each of the existing methods, we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue, since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions.</sample>
    <sample id="386">The video presents a detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement for various evaluation methods in conversational AI. It begins with a slide titled "Inter-Annotator Agreement," displaying a graph with multiple lines representing different evaluation methods. The x-axis shows the evaluation methods, while the y-axis indicates the inter-annotator agreement score. The methods include ABC-Eval, Turn Likert, Dialogue Likert, and Comparative. The graph shows that ABC-Eval consistently has the highest agreement scores across all metrics, indicating its reliability. The video then highlights the ABC-Eval method's superior performance, emphasizing its overall reliability compared to other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="387" />
    <sample id="388" />
    <sample id="389">The video presents a detailed analysis of chat quality evaluation metrics, focusing on their predictive and incremental validity. It begins with a bar chart titled "Predictive Validity," which compares the performance of various metrics in explaining the quality of chat interactions. The metrics are categorized into "Interactive Ques" and "Interactive Ques," with the x-axis representing different chat quality metrics and the y-axis showing the percentage of quality explained. The chart highlights that "ABC-Eval" and "Turn Likert" are the most effective metrics, while "Dialogue Likert" and "Comparative" are less effective.

The video then transitions to a line chart titled "Incremental Validity," which illustrates the incremental value of each metric in explaining chat quality. The x-axis represents different chat quality metrics, and the y-axis shows the percentage of quality explained. The chart shows that "ABC-Eval" has the highest incremental value, followed by "Turn Likert," "</sample>
    <sample id="390">The video features a presentation on the incremental validity of various metrics in evaluating conversation quality. The presenter, a man in a blue shirt, discusses the importance of combining different metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of conversation quality. The video includes a graph titled "Incremental Validity," which shows the percentage of conversation quality explained by different metrics. The graph includes three lines representing "ABC-Eval," "Turn-Likert," and "Dialogue-Likert." The presenter explains that the combination of all ABC-Eval metrics explains over 25% of conversation quality, and removing these metrics one at a time results in losing a significant amount of information about the quality. The video also includes a slide with the title "Incremental Validity" and a graph showing the percentage of conversation quality explained by different metrics, with the ABC-Eval metrics represented by a blue line. The presenter discusses the importance of combining different metrics to gain</sample>
    <sample id="391" />
    <sample id="392">The video presents a detailed analysis of conversational AI models using three key metrics: Incremental Validity, ABC-Eval Error Rates, and ABC-Eval Error Rates by Model. The analysis is conducted by Emory University, with contributions from Alexa AI. The video begins with a slide titled "Incremental Validity by Model," which displays a bar chart comparing the performance of various models in terms of incremental validity. The chart shows that models like "ABC-Eval," "Turn Likert," and "Dialogue Likert" perform better than others, such as "Antisocial," "CS-Centre," and "Emory." The video then transitions to a slide titled "ABC-Eval Error Rates by Model," which presents a bar chart illustrating the error rates of different models. The chart indicates that models like "Emory" and "Blender2" have lower error rates compared to others, such as "Antisocial" and "CS-Centre." The video further delves into the ABC-Eval Error Rates by Model, showing a detailed breakdown of error rates for each model across various categories. The chart highlights that models like "Emory" and "</sample>

A study on model stability reveals that continual pre-training with a higher intermediate variability for Camembert-based models trained on 4GB of data yields better results. The video highlights the effectiveness of continual pre-training, showing comparable or superior performance to search-based methods.

    <sample id="537">Hello everyone, my name is David Vilar Torres and I will be giving a short overview of the paper 'Prompting PaLM for Translation: Assessing Strategies and Performance'. This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate.</sample>
    <sample id="538">The video presents an overview of the PaLM (Pathways Language Model) developed by Chowdhery et al. in 2022. It highlights the model's architecture, training data, and performance across various benchmarks. The video begins by introducing the model's architecture, which is based on the Transformer architecture. It then explains that the model was trained on a large collection of text data, comprising 780 billion tokens. The video also mentions that the model has 540 billion parameters and was trained on 6144 TPU v4 chips. The performance of the model is evaluated on several benchmarks, including question answering, arithmetic, code completion, summarization, translation, and language understanding. The video concludes by summarizing the key features of the PaLM model and its potential applications in natural language processing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="539" />
    <sample id="540">In this work, we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="541">We evaluated the transition capability of such models using the best practices of the MT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="542">We compare two state-of-the-art systems. The best performing systems are the WMT evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="543">We use state-of-the-art neural machine translation metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="544">The prompting has a big influence on the performance of the of llms for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one short prompting and provided two different prompts for for just a sentence</sample>
    <sample id="545">The majority of sentences, 516 out of 1000, show a difference of more than 1 BLEURT point. The difference can go up to 40 BLEURT points.</sample>
    <sample id="546">The video features a speaker discussing the significant impact of prompts on translation quality. The speaker explains that by selecting two random prompts for each sentence and computing BLEURT scores for each sentence-prompt pair, they found that the majority of sentences (516 out of 1000) show a difference of more than 1 BLEURT point, with differences going up to 40 BLEURT points in extreme cases. The speaker emphasizes the importance of selecting a good prompting strategy to improve translation quality.</sample>
    <sample id="547">In our experiments, we settled for a five-shot prompting strategy where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in.</sample>
    <sample id="548">so in this example uh here where we perform translation from german into english the german sentences the source sentences are marked with german colon and the english translations with english colon</sample>
    <sample id="549">We observed that the actual form of the prompting does not have a significant impact in the case of several short promptings.</sample>
    <sample id="550">It's crucial for zero-shot and one-shot prompting, and when we go, as in our case, to five-shot prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the of the prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="551">English	It's the examples that carry most of the weight.</sample>
    <sample id="552">The summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="553">The video discusses the importance of selecting high-quality examples for training machine translation models, particularly focusing on the use of specialized SOTA systems and the performance of PaLM compared to Google Translate. It highlights the significance of example quality over similarity to source sentences and presents insights from the Machine Quality Metrics (MQM) evaluation. The video also mentions the use of prompts from the training data of the WMT evaluations or the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="554">The dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data, which makes the results show a better performance when using the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="555">The video presents a slide titled "Experimental Results" with two main sections: "Experimental Results" and "Insights from MQM." The "Experimental Results" section lists four key points: 1. Example quality is more important than similarity to the source sentence. 2. Specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage. 3. PalM is close to Google Translate. 4. The "Insights from MQM" section provides four additional points: 1. Fluency of PalM is comparable to SOTA. 2. Accuracy scores are generally lower. 3. Dominated by "Accuracy/Omission." 4. "Style/Awkward" is generally lower for PalM. The slide also includes a circular image of a person in the bottom right corner, with a Google logo and a small text "Google" next to it. The background is white, and the text is black, making it easy to read. The overall design is simple and professional, focusing on delivering the information clearly and concisely.</sample>
    <sample id="556">The main difference comes from the accuracy. The accuracy scores are generally lower for PalM, and this is dominated by the "Accuracy/Omission" metric. Additionally, the "Style/Awkward" metric is generally lower for PalM compared to SOTA systems.</sample>
    <sample id="557">The most common error are omission errors.</sample>
    <sample id="558">English	so it seems that palm chooses them to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are omitted in the translation</sample>
    <sample id="559">The video presents a slide titled "Experimental Results" with two main sections: "Example quality is more important than similarity to source sentence" and "Specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage." It also includes "Insights from MQM," which highlight that PalM's fluency is comparable to SOTA, its accuracy scores are generally lower, and it is dominated by "Accuracy/Omission." Additionally, the "Style/Awkward" category for PalM is generally lower than for the state-of-the-art systems, indicating an additional signal.</sample>
    <sample id="560">The speaker discusses the results of an experiment comparing different systems for machine translation. They highlight that example quality is more important than similarity to the source sentence, and specialized SOTA systems have a substantial advantage. The speaker also notes that PalM is close to Google Translate in performance. Insights from MQM indicate that PalM's fluency is comparable to SOTA, but its accuracy scores are generally lower, dominated by "Accuracy/Omission." Additionally, PalM tends to produce "Style/Awkward" translations more frequently than SOTA systems.</sample>
    <sample id="561">The video features a static word cloud centered around the theme of expressing gratitude, with the word 'thank you' prominently displayed in the middle. Surrounding it are various translations of 'thank you' in different languages, such as 'danke' (German), 'merci' (French), 'grazie' (Italian), 'obrigado' (Portuguese), 'спасибо' (Russian), 'merci' (French), 'danke' (German), 'thank you' (English), 'merci' (French), 'спасибо' (Russian). The background is white, and the text is in various colors, creating a visually engaging and multilingual representation of thanks. In the bottom right corner, there is a small circular inset showing a person wearing a checkered shirt, who appears to be speaking. The person's face is not visible, and they are positioned against a blurred background. The overall design is clean and modern, with a focus on the word cloud and the speaker's presence.</sample>

    <sample id="601">Recent works in tasks like question answering show that models can use pre-trained time knowledge to solve the task.</sample>

    <sample id="603">The sentence "John saw the newly elected president on TV" is an example of a declarative sentence. It is a statement that provides information or makes a claim. In this case, the statement is about John's action of watching the newly elected president on television.</sample>
    <sample id="604" />
    <sample id="605">The video discusses the importance of integrating both pre-trained and inference-time knowledge for effective knowledge-intensive natural language understanding (NNU) tasks. It highlights the limitations of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge and emphasizes the need for models to adapt and utilize inference-time knowledge to handle new or unseen information. The video also mentions the use of a pre-trained language model, GPT-3, and its ability to generate responses based on both pre-trained and inference-time knowledge.</sample>

    <sample id="613">The speaker introduces three settings of KITMUS: 1. Background Pretrain: Background knowledge is assumed to be available at pre-training time. 2. Background Both: Background knowledge is explicitly provided during both pre-training and inference. 3. Background Inference: Background knowledge is only available at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="614">The speaker is explaining the three variants of KITMUS, which are different ways to incorporate background knowledge into a model.</sample>
    <sample id="615">This last setting is especially interesting since it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre-trained data of models. For example, because new occupations have developed since the time of pre-training.</sample>
    <sample id="616" />
    <sample id="617">In the background-pretrain setting, we assume that the background knowledge "politicians seek elected seats in government" is contained in the pre-trained parameters. In the influence setting, we provide the anti-specific knowledge "Chichester is a politician."</sample>
    <sample id="618">In the background both setting, we additionally provide not only anti-specific but also background knowledge about politicians in the inferred set context.</sample>
    <sample id="619">The video presents a detailed explanation of the three variants of KITMUS (Knowledge-Inference Task Model for Understanding Sentences), focusing on how the background influences the model's performance. The presenter, wearing a headset and a blue shirt, discusses the differences between the background-pretrain, background-both, and background-inference settings.

In the background-pretrain setting, the model is trained with a background that includes the statement "Politicians seek elected seats in government." This background is used to provide the model with a general understanding of the political context.

In the background-both setting, the model is trained with a background</sample>
    <sample id="620">We evaluate the dataset both with human study participants and established reference resolution models. In this figure, we show the results of the best performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-train setting.</sample>

    <sample id="622">This suggests that when trained on general question-answering datasets, models learn to exploit surface cues that are not useful when testing on kidmose, where such cues have been removed.</sample>
    <sample id="623" />
    <sample id="624">However, with task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="625">The video presents a conclusion slide with three main takeaways: 1. Many models struggle to reason over knowledge from multiple sources, such as pretrain-time and inference-time knowledge. 2. Task-specific training is necessary for effective knowledge integration. 3. Models face challenges integrating inference-time background knowledge. The presenter encourages viewers to explore the dataset, generation, and evaluation code on GitHub at mpoems/kitmus for more details. The video concludes with a thank you message.</sample>

    <sample id="671">The speaker begins by stating that models have been using CoNLL-2003 to develop Named Entity Recognition (NER) for almost 20 years. This long-standing use of the dataset naturally raises several questions, particularly about the ability of these models to generalize to modern data. The speaker then poses the question: Can these models generalize to modern data? This question is crucial as it addresses the effectiveness and adaptability of existing NER models in handling contemporary datasets, which may differ significantly from those used during the initial training phase.</sample>

    <sample id="678">The first one is the model architecture. Through our experiments, we found that the transformer models normally generalize better to new data.</sample>
    <sample id="679">The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually, larger models lead to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="680" />
    <sample id="681">The performance drop of some models is caused by the lack of sufficient training data.</sample>
    <sample id="682">The second one is adaptive overfitting, which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again, and this is usually manifested as the diminishing returns on the new test set.</sample>
    <sample id="683">The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data.</sample>
    <sample id="684">For adaptive overfitting, we saw that from the graph on the right, the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one.</sample>
    <sample id="685">This means that every unit of improvement that we made on colon 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on colon++ which means that there is no diminishing returns.</sample>
    <sample id="686" />
    <sample id="687">Temporal drift.</sample>
    <sample id="688">For temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data, and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap.</sample>
    <sample id="689" />
    <sample id="690">Our conclusion is that for good generalization, we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine-tuning examples. And these goals hand in hand, we can't just have one ingredient, but throughout the others.</sample>

    <sample id="705">Social bias and stereotypes are prevalent in LLMs.</sample>
    <sample id="706">The video discusses the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in Large Language Models (LLMs) and highlights the limitations of existing stereotype measures. It explains that these measures often rely on hand-constructed datasets, which are time-consuming to curate, and they face a trade-off between specificity and generalizability. Additionally, they do not account for intersectionality, meaning they may not fully capture the complexity of overlapping social identities.</sample>
    <sample id="707">The video discusses the limitations of existing stereotype measures in large language models (LLMs). It highlights three main issues: 1) A trade-off between specificity and generalizability, 2) The use of fixed, hand-curated datasets, and 3) The failure to account for intersectionality. The video explains that these limitations result in LLMs perpetuating social biases and stereotypes, as they often only measure very specific stereotypes or capture very general, broad associations.</sample>
    <sample id="708">The video discusses the limitations of existing stereotype measures in large language models (LLMs). It highlights three main points:

1. **Tradeoff between specificity and generalizability**: Existing measures often struggle to balance the need for specific, detailed representations of groups with the ability to generalize across different contexts.

2. **Based on fixed, hand-curated datasets**: These measures are typically built using static datasets, which may not capture the full complexity and diversity of real-world data.

3. **Don't account for intersectionality**: Most measures fail to consider how multiple social identities (e.g., race, gender, class) intersect and compound biases, leading to unique and nuanced forms of harm.</sample>
    <sample id="709">The video features a speaker discussing the limitations of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and how newer instruction-tuned language models address these limitations. The speaker explains that these newer models are very good at responding to instructions and prompts, which allows them to overcome the limitations of the previous models. The video is presented in a simple format with a beige background and black text, and the speaker is shown in a small window in the top right corner.</sample>
    <sample id="710">The video discusses the limitations of AI models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in understanding and generating content related to intersectional identities. It highlights how these models can respond to instructions in prompts, such as imagining oneself as an Asian woman and describing oneself. The video emphasizes the importance of overcoming these limitations to ensure that AI models can evaluate and generate content for any intersectional identity.</sample>
    <sample id="711">The video discusses the limitations of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in understanding and responding to prompts, particularly in relation to intersectional identities. It highlights how these models can generalize to any demographic by specifying the desired identity marker in the prompt.</sample>
    <sample id="712">The image shows a slide titled "Output: Persona Examples (GPT-4)" with a table containing three rows, each representing a different persona. The personas are:

1. **Asian woman**
2. **Middle-Eastern woman**
3. **White man**

Each row includes a description of the persona's physical appearance and personality traits. The background of the slide is white, and the text is primarily black, with some blue highlights. The table is organized with two columns: the left column lists the persona names, and the right column provides the detailed descriptions. The slide also includes a small image of a person in the top right corner, but the details of this image are not relevant to the content of the slide.</sample>
    <sample id="713">they are still negative and toxic in the sense that they are perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases.</sample>
    <sample id="714">There are some interesting patterns in the way people describe themselves. For example, the Asian woman describes her almond-shaped eyes as conveying a sense of quiet strength and wisdom, while the Middle-Eastern woman describes her eyes as framing a deep and mysterious gaze. The White man, on the other hand, describes his pale skin as sometimes reddening in the sun if he's not careful with his sunscreen. These descriptions highlight the unique features and characteristics that people associate with their own identities.</sample>
    <sample id="715">The video presents a detailed analysis of three persona examples generated by GPT-4, focusing on the Asian woman, Middle-Eastern woman, and White man. Each persona is described through a series of descriptive texts that highlight their physical characteristics, cultural backgrounds, and personality traits. The video emphasizes the importance of using culturally sensitive and accurate language when describing individuals from different ethnicities and regions. It also underscores the need to avoid stereotypes and generalizations, and to approach each person as an individual with unique qualities and experiences.</sample>
    <sample id="716" />
    <sample id="717">The first part is generating these personas using prompts like "imagine you are an Asian woman. describe yourself."</sample>
    <sample id="718">The video discusses the inspiration behind the prompts used to generate personas. It mentions a study where prompts were given to human subjects, revealing that these prompts could surface racial stereotypes.</sample>
    <sample id="719">The video is a static presentation slide with a beige background and black text. It features a single speaker in the top right corner, wearing a dark shirt and glasses, speaking directly to the camera. The slide is titled "2 steps" and contains the following text:

"1. Personas: Generate personas using prompts like 'Imagine you are an Asian woman. Describe yourself.'
a. Inspired by psych study with human subjects using the same prompts"

The speaker discusses the process of generating personas using prompts inspired by psychological studies. The slide emphasizes the importance of comparing generated personas with human responses to improve the accuracy and realism of the personas.</sample>
    <sample id="720">The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, which I'll elaborate on shortly.</sample>
    <sample id="721">The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon.</sample>
    <sample id="722">The video is a static presentation slide with a beige background and black text. It explains the concept of markedness in linguistics, specifically focusing on the marked words method. The slide is divided into two sections: the top section introduces the concept, while the bottom section provides an example. The text is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the key points being discussed.</sample>
    <sample id="723">The video is a static presentation slide with a beige background and black text. It features a title at the top that reads "Insight for Step 2: Marked Words." Below the title, there are three bullet points explaining the concept of markedness in language. The first bullet point states that unmarked groups are default and ordinary. The second bullet point explains that marked groups differ from the default. The third bullet point provides an example: "a warrior (unmarked) vs. a woman warrior (marked)." In the top right corner of the slide, there is a small video frame showing a person wearing a black and white striped shirt, who appears to be speaking. The person's face is not visible, and they are looking slightly to the side. The video frame is static, and the person does not move or change expressions.</sample>
    <sample id="724" />
    <sample id="725">so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are</sample>
    <sample id="726">The video focuses on the second step of a process, which involves identifying and comparing marked groups using the "fighting words" method. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### **Step 2: Marked Words**

#### **1. Define Unmarked and Marked Groups**
- **Unmarked Groups:** These are the baseline categories or groups that serve as a reference point. For example, in the context of personas, unmarked groups might include "White" and "Man."
- **Marked Groups:** These are the specific categories or groups that are being analyzed and compared. In this case, the marked group is "Black woman personas."

#### **2. Use Weighted Log-Odds Ratios to Distinguish Top Words for Each Marked Group**
- **Weighted Log-Odds Ratios:** This statistical method is used to identify words that are significantly more or less frequent in the marked group compared to the unmarked groups.
- **Top Words:** These are the words that show the strongest association with the marked group. For example, in the context of "Black woman personas," the top words might include "stereotypes," "discrimination," or "empowerment."

#### **Example:**
- **For Black Woman Personas:**
  - **Unmarked Groups:** "White" and "Man."
  - **Marked Group:** "Black woman."
  - **Top Words:** Words that are more frequently associated with "Black woman" personas compared to "White" and "Man" personas.

### **Purpose of the Method:**
- The "fighting words" method helps in identifying the unique characteristics and challenges faced by specific groups, such as "Black woman personas," by comparing them to broader, unmarked groups.
- This approach is useful in fields like social sciences, marketing, and policy-making, where understanding group differences is crucial.

### **Key Takeaways:**
- The method involves defining unmarked and marked groups.
- It uses weighted log-odds ratios to identify the most significant words associated with the marked group.
- The example provided illustrates how this method can be applied to analyze and compare different personas.</sample>
    <sample id="727">The speaker is explaining a method for analyzing text data, specifically focusing on identifying words that are associated with certain groups. The method involves two main steps: 1. Define unmarked and marked groups. 2. Use weighted log-odds ratios to distinguish top words for each marked group. The example given is for the personas of black women. The speaker suggests identifying "fighting words" and comparing the log-odds ratios against both white personas and man personas, as these are the two corresponding unmarked groups.</sample>
    <sample id="728">The video presents a comparison of stereotype word usage in generated personas versus human-written personas. The results show that generated personas contain a significantly higher percentage of stereotype words, particularly for white stereotypes, compared to human-written personas. The video highlights the prevalence of stereotypes in AI-generated content and suggests that this is a critical area for improvement in AI systems.</sample>
    <sample id="729">The speaker discusses the distribution of words in a lexicon, noting that the actual distribution differs significantly from expectations.</sample>
    <sample id="730">The human-written personas have a much wider distribution of words, while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words "tall" and "athletic".</sample>
    <sample id="731" />
    <sample id="732">The speaker is discussing the limitations of a black stereotype lexicon, which doesn't capture many harmful patterns seen in earlier slides. To address this, they plan to use a marked words method to show how positive-sounding words can still facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="733">The video presents a slide titled "Results: Patterns in Top Words," which discusses the findings of an analysis on media portrayals of different racial and ethnic groups. The slide is divided into two main sections: "Othering through essentializing narratives" and "Pernicious positive portrayals."

### **Section 1: Othering through essentializing narratives**
- **Key Point:** The slide highlights how certain words are used to define racial and ethnic groups solely based on their identity, perpetuating stereotypes.
- **Examples:**
  - **Culture:** Used to generalize and oversimplify the diverse experiences of a group.
  - **Tradition:** Implies that a group is static and unchanging, ignoring cultural evolution.
  - **Proud:** While positive, it can be used to exoticize or objectify a group, reducing their identity to a single trait.
  - **Exotic:** Often used to objectify and fetishize a group, emphasizing their difference rather than their humanity.
- **Implication:** These narratives reduce complex identities to simplistic and often harmful stereotypes, reinforcing systemic biases.

### **Section 2: Pernicious positive portrayals**
- **Key Point:** The slide critiques how certain positive portrayals, while seemingly complimentary, can be harmful by reinforcing stereotypes.
- **Examples:**
  1. **Vibrant, curvaceous for Latina women:**
     - **Harmful Aspect:** Reduces Latina women to their physical appearance and sexuality, ignoring their individuality and agency.
  2. **Petite, delicate, silky for Asian women:**
     - **Harmful As</sample>
    <sample id="734">second for pernicious positive portrayals the top words include things like vibrant curvaceous for latin women petite delicate silky for asian women strong resilient for black women and these words define these groups only by their relationship to the white norm</sample>
    <sample id="735">This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups.</sample>
    <sample id="736">The video presents a slide titled "Results: Patterns in Top Words" with a beige background and black text. The slide discusses the use of stereotypes and essentializing narratives in media, particularly focusing on how women of color are portrayed. It highlights the use of words like "culture," "tradition," "proud," and "exotic" to define women of color, which can be limiting and reduce their identities to stereotypes. The slide also mentions "pernicious positive portrayals," such as describing Latina women as "vibrant" and "curvaceous," Asian women as "petite" and "delicate," and Black women as "strong" and "resilient." These portrayals, while seemingly positive, can still be harmful as they reinforce narrow and often negative stereotypes. The slide emphasizes the importance of recognizing and challenging these patterns to promote more diverse and accurate representations of women of color in media.</sample>
    <sample id="737">For Asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky.</sample>
    <sample id="738">The video presents a slide titled "Results: Patterns in Top Words," which discusses the use of language in media and its impact on perceptions of different racial and ethnic groups. The slide is divided into two main sections: "Othering through essentializing narratives" and "Pernicious positive portrayals."</sample>
    <sample id="739">and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient</sample>
    <sample id="740">The video presents a slide titled "Results: Patterns in Top Words" with a beige background and black text. The slide discusses two main points:

1. **Othering through essentializing narratives**:
   - It highlights how certain words like "culture," "tradition," "proud," and "exotic" are used to define groups of people solely based on their identity.

2. **Pernicious positive portrayals**:
   - It points out how certain positive words are used to stereotype specific groups:
     - "Vibrant, curvaceous for Latina women"
     - "Petite, delicate, silky for Asian women"
     - "Strong, resilient for Black women"

The video suggests that these portrayals, while seemingly positive, can be harmful as they reduce individuals to stereotypes and limit their identities.</sample>
    <sample id="741">There's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles.</sample>
    <sample id="742">The video presents a slide titled "Results: Patterns in Top Words," which discusses the impact of essentializing narratives on marginalized groups. The slide is divided into two main sections: "Othering through essentializing narratives" and "Pernicious positive portrayals." The first section highlights how essentializing narratives, such as those using terms like "culture," "tradition," "proud," and "exotic," define marginalized groups solely by their identity, leading to negative health outcomes. The second section discusses pernicious positive portrayals, such as describing Latina women as "vibrant" and "curvaceous," Asian women as "petite" and "delicate," and Black women as "strong" and "resilient." These portrayals, while seemingly positive, can be harmful as they reduce individuals to stereotypes and limit their complexity. The video emphasizes the importance of avoiding such narratives to promote a more inclusive and accurate representation of diverse groups.</sample>
    <sample id="743">More broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="744">so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners</sample>
    <sample id="745">First, we should address positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. Second, we should use an intersectional lens to study biases and harms, as there are many things that might be overlooked if we don't do that. Third, we should be transparent about bias mitigation.</sample>
    <sample id="746">The video presents a slide with three recommendations for addressing bias in AI systems. The first recommendation is to address positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, which involves recognizing and challenging harmful generalizations about groups of people. The second recommendation is to use an intersectional lens, which means considering how different aspects of a person's identity, such as race, gender, and class, intersect and impact their experiences. The third recommendation is to increase transparency about bias mitigation methods, which involves being open about the techniques used to reduce bias in AI systems and how they are implemented.</sample>
    <sample id="747">The speaker is discussing the importance of addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, as well as the need for an intersectional lens and transparency about bias mitigation. They mention that for instance, these positive stereotypes may not be due to some sort of weird cognitive bias, but rather a lack of understanding or awareness of the complexities involved.</sample>
    <sample id="748">The video discusses the issue of over-representation of positive stereotypes in media and its impact on marginalized groups. It highlights the need for addressing these stereotypes and emphasizes the importance of an intersectional lens to understand the complexities of identity. The video also stresses the significance of transparency in bias mitigation efforts and suggests alternative methods to value alignment, such as anti-stereotyping techniques.</sample>
    <sample id="749">We just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency.</sample>

    <sample id="776">The video begins with a slide introducing the topic of protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding and services using a backdoor watermark. The slide features logos of Microsoft, Sony AI, and other organizations, along with a list of authors and affiliations. The background is white, and the text is in black, making it easy to read. The video then transitions to a slide with a blue background and white text, which reads 'Background.' This slide provides context for the topic, explaining that large language models (LLMs) are exceptional in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). It also mentions the importance of embedding and services in LLMs and the need to protect their copyright. The video then transitions to a slide with the title 'Are You Copying My Model?' and the subtitle 'Protecting the Copyright of Large Language Models for Embedding and Services via Backdoor Watermark.' This slide provides an overview of the paper's main focus, which is to protect the copyright of large language models for embedding and service applications using a backdoor watermark. The slide also includes a list of authors and affiliations, as well as logos of Microsoft, Sony AI, and other related organizations. The background is white, and the text and logos are in black, making it easy to read.</sample>
    <sample id="777">Large language models (LLMs) are exceptional in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). GPT, LLAMA, and PALM are examples of these models. Embedding as a Service (EaaS) is offered to assist various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. OpenAI offers a GPT3-based embedding API.</sample>
    <sample id="778">GPT, LAMA, and PALM are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation.</sample>
    <sample id="779">embedding as a service is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="780">OpenAI offers a GPT-based embedding API.</sample>
    <sample id="781" />
    <sample id="782">To protect the copyright of embedding and services, one solution is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="783">The watermark method needs to meet the following properties:

1. The method should be applicable to embedding as services.
2. The watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings.
3. The watermark should be covert to the attacker.
4. The watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services.</sample>
    <sample id="784">Third, the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker, or the attacker can remove the watermark easily.</sample>
    <sample id="785" />
    <sample id="786" />
    <sample id="787" />
    <sample id="788">therefore, in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services.</sample>
    <sample id="789">The video begins with a slide titled "EmbMarker," which introduces the concept of embedding markers. The slide explains that embedding markers consist of two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. The watermark injection step involves counting the frequency of words in a general text corpus and randomly selecting n words in a moderate-frequency interval. The copyright verification step involves generating a target embedding by combining the original embedding, a target embedding, and a provided embedding. The video then shows a diagram that illustrates the process of embedding markers. The diagram shows a copy dataset, a provider's model, and a target embedding. The provider's model is used to generate a target embedding, which is then combined with the original embedding and a provided embedding to create the final embedding. The video concludes with a slide that summarizes the key points of the embedding marker process.</sample>
    <sample id="790" />
    <sample id="791">We assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it.</sample>
    <sample id="792">In watermark injection, we first define a target embedding. When a user sends a sentence to the provider's service, the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="793">The provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="794">The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. When the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="795" />
    <sample id="796">The backdoor dataset contains sentences where all words belong to the trigger set, while all words in the sentences of the benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set.</sample>
    <sample id="797" />
    <sample id="798">The cosine and L2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. We compute the similarity difference between the benign and backdoor dataset, which is defined as delta cosine and delta L2.</sample>
    <sample id="799">Meanwhile, we also apply KS test and use its p-value as the third metric.</sample>
    <sample id="800">We conduct experiments on four datasets: AG News, MIND, SST2, and Enron Spam. We assume the provider applies the Wikitext dataset to count word frequency.</sample>
    <sample id="801" />
    <sample id="802">The legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="803">As shown in the figures, it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="804">That's all. Thank you. Welcome to discuss with us.</sample>
    <sample id="805">The video features a presentation slide with a blue background and white text. The slide includes the title "Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation" and the names of the presenters: Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi. The slide also displays the logos of the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler.</sample>
    <sample id="806" />
    <sample id="807">The current SimulST models face several challenges, including:

1. **Overfitting**: Specific architectures are often trained, leading to overfitting.
2. **Complexity**: The need to introduce additional modules to optimize performance increases the complexity of the models.
3. **Scalability**: These models may struggle to scale effectively to larger datasets or more complex tasks.
4. **Generalization**: There is a risk of poor generalization to new, unseen data due to the specialized nature of the training.
5. **Resource Intensive**: Training and optimizing these models can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.</sample>
    <sample id="808" />
    <sample id="809" />
    <sample id="810">The solution is to use a combination of technology and human expertise to provide personalized and efficient solutions to complex problems.</sample>
    <sample id="811">The video presents a solution to the challenge of latency in SimulST, a simulation tool. It suggests two main approaches:

1. **Leverage Existing Offline ST Models:**
   - **No Retraining Needed:** The solution recommends using pre-existing offline ST models without the need for retraining.
   - **No Specific Architecture Required:** It emphasizes that there is no need to adopt a specific architecture for SimulST.

2. **Single Model for Each Latency Regime:**
   - **Efficiency:** The solution proposes using only one model for every latency regime.
   - **Latency Handling:** Latency is managed through specific parameters.

This approach aims to simplify the process and reduce the computational complexity associated with latency in SimulST.</sample>
    <sample id="812">The speaker explains the solution to the problem of low latency in speech-to-text (ST) models. The solution involves using existing offline ST models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for SimuST, using only one model for every latency regime and handling latency through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output, and leveraging the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual outputs. The speaker also provides an example on the right side of the slide to illustrate the solution.</sample>
    <sample id="813">The speaker is introducing their proposed solution, which is a strategy for deciding whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to. The solution is called "EDAtt" and it is a strategy for which the speaker will provide more details in the upcoming slides.</sample>
    <sample id="814" />
    <sample id="815">The speaker is explaining the concept of Encoder-Decoder Attention in the context of natural language processing, specifically focusing on the decision-making process for emitting or not emitting a partial translation. The speaker uses an example sentence in English, "I am going to talk about...", and discusses how the model determines whether to emit a translation in German, "Ich werde reden." The speaker highlights the importance of the model's ability to decide based on the concentration of attention points and the amount of information received.</sample>
    <sample id="816">The speaker is discussing the concept of cross-attention weights in the context of encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. They explain that these weights are used to determine the importance of different parts of the input sequence when generating the output sequence. The speaker mentions that the cross-attention weights are calculated based on the similarity between the encoder's hidden states and the decoder's hidden states. They also note that the cross-attention weights are used to weight the encoder's hidden states when generating the output sequence.</sample>
    <sample id="817">We will see that the first two words point to the earliest received speech frames, while the last word points to the last received speech frames as lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="818">This means that the first two words will be emitted.</sample>

    <sample id="820">The speaker is explaining the process of analyzing a speech sequence using the Encoder-Decoder Attention model.

    <sample id="841">Hi everyone, I'm Kostya Sinha and I'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our ACL 2023 paper, "Language model acceptability judgements are not always robust to context."</sample>
    <sample id="842">Meta AI.</sample>
    <sample id="843">so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm</sample>
    <sample id="844">The video discusses the Minimal Pair Paradigm (MPP), which evaluates language models based on their ability to make acceptability judgments. These judgments can include grammaticality, like BLIMP, SyntaxGym, or CrowS, or acceptability in terms of stereotypes, such as CrowS pairs. The MPP is used to assess how well language models can predict human judgments of acceptability, which is crucial for understanding their performance in real-world language processing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="845" />
    <sample id="846">And then the hope is that the model basically  uh  puts more probability to the acceptable sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="847">The current MPP pipeline doesn't allow us to evaluate a model's acceptance towards longer sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="848">The video discusses the Minimal Pair Paradigm (MPP) and its implications for evaluating language models. It highlights the challenges of assessing model performance with long preceding context and introduces three evaluation methods: BLIMP, SyntaxGym, and CrowS. The video emphasizes the importance of evaluating models with long context windows and suggests that future research should focus on developing more effective evaluation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="849">The speaker is discussing the Minimal Pair Paradigm (MPP) and how it is used to evaluate language models. They explain that MPP involves presenting language models with minimal pairs, which are pairs of words that differ by only one phoneme, and asking them to predict which word comes first in a sentence. The speaker then introduces three different models: BLIMP, SyntaxGym, and CrowS, and compares their performance on MPP. They also discuss the concept of stability in language models and how it relates to the MPP paradigm.</sample>
    <sample id="850" />
    <sample id="851">so for example here we have chosen like a typical pair of grammaticality from the blimp dataset from the adjunct island case</sample>
    <sample id="852" />
    <sample id="853" />
    <sample id="854">The video discusses a method to test whether MPP (Multimodal Prompting) judgments vary as a function of context length, structural match, and acceptability. It uses a specific example involving a subject-verb agreement task. The approach involves selecting sentences that are either acceptable or unacceptable based on their grammatical correctness. The video explains that by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching context, one can test the model's ability to identify and correct errors. This method helps in evaluating the model's performance in terms of its acceptability judgments and its ability to handle different types of errors.</sample>
    <sample id="855" />
    <sample id="856" />
    <sample id="857" />
    <sample id="858">so this will tell us like whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context</sample>
    <sample id="859" />
    <sample id="860">okay so how does the model do so first we look at the wikipedia sentences which are completely irrelevant to the current query pair and there we find that the mpp judgements are mostly robust for arbitrary context lengths</sample>
    <sample id="861">We increase the context length toward up to 2024 for to max out OPT and GPT-2 models, and we saw here in the orange dot line the MPP judgments are relatively stable.</sample>
    <sample id="862">When we choose sentences from the same dataset, the performance of the model tends to be higher.</sample>
    <sample id="863">okay so here we are choosing or creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blimp or syntax gym dataset</sample>
    <sample id="864">The MPP judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes.</sample>
    <sample id="865">we get the best performance.</sample>
    <sample id="866" />
    <sample id="867">The speaker is discussing the impact of context length on the performance of MPP (Multi-Person Parsing) models. They mention that the effect of context length on model performance increases as the context length grows, and this could significantly affect newer language models that have larger context windows.</sample>
    <sample id="868">The match prefix affects the language model judgment significantly because it introduces a form of context dependency that the model must learn to handle. When a prefix is matched, the model is forced to consider the specific context provided by the prefix, which can influence its predictions and understanding of the sentence. This context dependency can lead to different interpretations and outputs based on the presence or absence of the matched prefix, thereby affecting the overall judgment of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="869">We then analyzed whether models are similarly sensitive to these sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="870">We find that none of these noises are actually making the model uh like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend.</sample>
    <sample id="871">basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways.</sample>
    <sample id="872">The speaker explains that when they perturb sentences in the acceptable domain, they observe a similar increase in all perturbations. Conversely, when perturbing sentences in the unacceptable domain, they see a decrease in MPP judgments in a similar fashion.</sample>
    <sample id="873">The key takeaways of our work are that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences, and that MPP evaluations with short, single-sentence inputs do not fully capture language models' abstract knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="874">The MPP evaluation, the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input, may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>

The presenter, Vasudha Varadarajan, introduces herself as a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University. She mentions that her work has been accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper. The focus of her research is on transfer learning for dissonance detection, specifically addressing the challenge of rare-class detection.</sample>
    <sample id="949">The video begins with a slide defining cognitive dissonance and its importance in language studies. It then introduces the concept of cognitive dissonance, explaining it as two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent. The video highlights the significance of studying cognitive dissonance in language, emphasizing its relevance to understanding human behavior and communication.</sample>
    <sample id="950">and they are in dissonance</sample>
    <sample id="951">The speaker explains that the second occurrence of the belief 'I don't think I could keep my job without them' justifies the action of grabbing a couple of smokes after the meeting today. They also mention that these beliefs have a consistency relationship.</sample>
    <sample id="952">The video begins with a slide titled 'What is Cognitive Dissonance?' which defines it as 'two elements of cognition (i.e., thoughts, actions, beliefs) that are inconsistent' and explains that it is expressed in language as a relationship between two phrases or statements by a user. The slide also notes that cognitive dissonance is relatively rare to find expressed in language compared to other discourse relations. The slide then provides a citation for the definition: 'Eddy Harmon-Jones and Cindy Harmon-Jones, 2007, Cognitive dissonance theory after 10 years of development, Zeitschrift fur Sozialpsychologie, 38(1/2), 1-16.' The slide also includes a visual representation of a person's head with a puzzle piece pattern, symbolizing the complexity of cognitive processes. The background of the slide is white, and the text is black, making it easy to read. The citation is in a smaller font size and is placed at the bottom of the slide. The visual representation of the person's head is centered on the slide, and the text is arranged around it. The slide is designed to be informative and visually appealing, with a clear and concise presentation of the definition of cognitive dissonance. The slide then transitions to a new slide with the same title, 'What is Cognitive Dissonance?' but with a different visual representation. The new slide features a person's head with a puzzle piece pattern in blue and green colors, symbolizing the complexity of cognitive processes. Below the head, there is a text box with the definition of cognitive dissonance: 'two elements of cognition (i.e., beliefs, actions, thoughts) that are inconsistent' expressed in language as a relationship between two phrases/statements by a user. The slide also notes that it is relatively rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations. The slide includes a citation for the definition: 'Eddy Harman-Jones and Cindy Harman-Jones, 2007, Cognitive Dissonance Theory After 10 Years of Development, Zeitschrift fur SozialPsychologie, 38(1/2).' The slide is designed to be informative and visually</sample>
    <sample id="953">Studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends in belief values and attitude changes in populations, and provide insights into how individuals and groups resolve conflicting beliefs and attitudes.</sample>

    <sample id="958">The video shows a static screen with a flowchart and annotations. The flowchart has three steps: 'Good parsing quality?', 'Discourse?', and 'Consonance?'. Each step has a 'Yes' or 'No' option, with percentages indicating the likelihood of each option. The flowchart is annotated with 'Discourse' and 'Consonance' in different colors. The screen also includes a Twitter logo, a user icon, and a note about checking a paper for detailed annotation guidelines. The video is static, with no changes in the flowchart or annotations.</sample>

    <sample id="960">On collecting around thousand examples of discourse unit pairs, we ran training for an initial classifier trained only on forty-three examples of dissonance. To no surprise, the classifier performed not much better than chance.</sample>
    <sample id="961">Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such dataset, we are facing the problem of absolute rarity.</sample>
    <sample id="962">To alleviate this, we experiment over combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissonant samples can be collected over lesser annotation rounds, lowering the overall annotation cost while improving dissonance detection.</sample>
    <sample id="963">The initial model was not able to capture the distance class at all, so we start the cold-start annotations by transferring weights from closely related tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="965">The speaker is discussing the use of transfer learning in natural language processing, specifically focusing on the RoBERTA-base model fine-tuned on two datasets: Debate and CE (Consonant and Vowel Expansion). The Debate dataset is used for training the model on a specific task, while the CE dataset is used for fine-tuning the model on a binary classification task related to the expansion and comparison of consonants and vowels. The speaker highlights the benefits of transfer learning in this context, such as improved performance and reduced training time.</sample>
    <sample id="966">The speaker discusses the performance of a model on a zero-shot annotated dataset, comparing it to a chance level. They mention that the model's performance is already much better than chance, with an AUC of 0.62.</sample>

The fine-tuning process involves first training on the initial dataset, then on CE, followed by Debate, and finally on CE again. The results show that fine-tuning on both tasks consecutively yields a much better zero-shot performance compared to training on individual tasks. The model used for cold-start active learning is the one that achieves the best performance after iterative fine-tuning.</sample>

    <sample id="970">The video presents a detailed explanation of the Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy in active learning. It begins with an overview of the active learning process, highlighting the importance of selecting informative examples to improve model performance. The video then introduces the Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy, which focuses on selecting examples that are highly likely to be misclassified by the current model. This strategy is particularly useful for rare classes, as it helps to improve the model's ability to recognize these classes. The video also discusses the use of a cumulative model to track the performance of the model over time and the importance of retraining the model after each round of active learning. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy and its application in active learning.</sample>
    <sample id="971">We compare this to the other state of the art strategies that are commonly used in the community.</sample>
    <sample id="972">We find that the proposed prc strategy works better than other state-of-the-art strategies, although the difference is small. Note that the performance is significantly lower for random.</sample>
    <sample id="973">The video presents a detailed analysis of active learning strategies, focusing on the probability-of-rare-class strategy. It begins with a bar chart comparing the performance of different active learning strategies, including baseline, transferred model, and various AL strategies like AL-Random, AL-Entropy, AL-Coverage, AL-CAL, and AL-PNC. The chart highlights the performance of these strategies in terms of AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores, with the transferred model showing the highest performance at 0.817. The video then introduces two best strategies, AL-Random and AL-PNC (pun), which are applied in further rounds of active learning. The performance of these strategies is shown to improve the AUC score to 0.75, which is the best performance achieved so far on the task. The video concludes with a discussion on the potential of these strategies and their application in other tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="974">The video presents a detailed analysis of different active learning strategies, focusing on their effectiveness in identifying rare classes and the associated costs. The analysis is structured into two main sections: the first part discusses the characteristics of various active learning strategies, while the second part evaluates the feasibility of these strategies in terms of annotation quality and costs.

### Section 1: Characteristics of Active Learning Strategies

The video begins by comparing four active learning strategies: Random, Entropy, Cost-Sensitive, and PRC (Probability of Rare Class). Each strategy is evaluated based on three criteria:

1. **Rare %**: The percentage of rare classes in the dataset.
2. **Time (s)**: The time taken to execute the strategy.
3. **Subj. diff.**: The subjective difficulty of the strategy for annotators.

The table below summarizes the findings:

| Strategy | Rare % | Time (s) | Subj. diff. |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Random   | 3.20   | 11.96    | -0.65      |
| Entropy  | 6.80   | 12.78    | -0.35      |
| Cost-Sensitive | 6.00   | 10.99    | -0.09      |
| PRC      | 7.60   | 13.55    | -0.71      |

- **Random**: This strategy selects samples randomly, resulting in a low percentage of rare classes (3.20%) and a relatively short execution time (11.96 seconds). However, it has a negative subjective difficulty score (-0.65), indicating that annotators find it easy.
- **Entropy**: This strategy selects samples based on entropy, leading to a higher percentage of rare classes (6.80%) and a slightly longer execution time (12.78 seconds). The subjective difficulty is slightly negative (-0.35), suggesting that annotators find it somewhat easy.
- **Cost-Sensitive**: This strategy considers the cost of annotating each sample, resulting in a higher percentage of rare classes (6.00%) and a shorter execution time (10.99 seconds). The subjective difficulty is very low (-0.09), indicating that annotators find it easy. However, the negative score suggests that it might be less effective in identifying rare classes.
- **PRC**: This strategy focuses on selecting samples from rare classes, resulting in the highest percentage of rare classes (7.60%) and the longest execution time (13.55 seconds). The subjective difficulty is the most negative (-0.71), indicating that annotators find it difficult.

### Section 2: Feasibility of Each Strategy

The video then evaluates the feasibility of each strategy in terms of annotation quality and costs. The key points are:

- **Minimum Annotation Cost Does Not Necessarily Lead to Better Models**: The video highlights that simply minimizing annotation costs does not guarantee better model performance. The effectiveness of a strategy depends on its ability to identify rare classes, which is crucial for improving model accuracy.
- **Rarity Could Make the Annotations More Difficult**: The video explains that rare classes are often more challenging to annotate due to their infrequency and complexity. This can lead to higher subjective difficulty scores for annotators.
- **To Increase Dissonance Samples, PRC Works the Best**: The video concludes that PRC is the most effective strategy for identifying rare classes, as it maximizes the percentage of rare classes in the selected samples. However, it also has the highest subjective difficulty score, indicating that annotators find it the most challenging.

### Conclusion

In summary, the video provides a comprehensive analysis of different active learning strategies, highlighting their effectiveness in identifying rare classes and the associated challenges for annotators. While PRC is the most effective strategy for increasing dissonance samples, it also has the highest subjective difficulty score. The video emphasizes the importance of balancing annotation cost and quality to achieve optimal model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="975">In summary, we find that PRC is a simple and efficient strategy for rare class acquisition, and cold-starting AL with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can significantly improve performance.</sample>

The slide remains static throughout the video, with no additional animations or changes.</sample>
    <sample id="1093">The speaker first proposes to prompt language models with different prompt formats using political questionnaires, such as the political compass test, to ensure automatic evaluation grounded in political science literature.</sample>
    <sample id="1094" />
    <sample id="1095">The speaker discusses the political leaning of various language models, placing them on a two-dimensional grid with 'Libertarian' on the left and 'Authoritarian' on the right, and 'Left' on the top and 'Right' on the bottom. They mention that GPT-4 is the most liberal model, while GPT-3 is the most authoritarian. They also note that GPT-3 is more left-leaning than BERT.</sample>
    <sample id="1096">The video presents a research study focused on understanding the political biases in language models, particularly how they are influenced by the data they are trained on. The study involves two main steps: first, further pretraining language models (RoBERTa and GPT-2) using news media and social media data, and second, evaluating the extent to which these models exhibit political biases.

### Step 1: Further Pretraining Language Models

The video begins by explaining the process of further pretraining language models using two distinct datasets:

1. **News Media Dataset**:
   - The dataset is divided into three categories: left, center, and right.
   - The left category is represented by a blue bar, the center by a gray bar, and the right by a red bar.
   - The video highlights that the left category is the most prominent, indicating a potential bias towards left-leaning content.

2. **Social Media Dataset (Reddit)**:
   - Similar to the news media dataset, the social media dataset is also divided into three categories: left, center,</sample>
    <sample id="1097">The speaker is discussing a research study on the political leaning of language models. They explain that they conducted a controlled experiment by further pretraining language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora, separated into news and social media, and further divided into their political leanings. The results of this experiment showed that the language models became more politically biased after pretraining on these corpora.</sample>
    <sample id="1098">The video presents a detailed analysis of the political leaning of language models, specifically comparing the pre-trained models RoBERTa and GPT-2. The results are visualized in a grid format, with each cell representing a different combination of political leaning and source of text data. The grid is divided into four quadrants, each corresponding to a different political leaning: left, center, and right. The source of text data is indicated by the color of the cell, with blue representing original news, green representing Reddit, and purple representing a combination of both. The video highlights the partisan shifts in the language models, showing that the models tend to lean towards the political ideology of the source of text data. The results suggest that further pre-training language models on partisan corpora can lead to a corresponding shift in the ideological coordinates of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="1099">For example, for RoBERTa, further fine-tuning and further training on the left-leaning Reddit corpus, we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its political leaning.</sample>
    <sample id="1100" />
    <sample id="1101">The video presents a detailed analysis of the shift in political sentiment from pre-45th to post-45th, focusing on the differences in language use between news and Reddit platforms. It highlights the polarization in language, particularly the use of negative terms like 'trump' and 'hillary,' and explores how language models can capture these shifts. The analysis includes visualizations of word usage trends and the impact of political events on language patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="1102">The video presents a detailed analysis of the differences in language use between the pre-45th and post-45th presidencies of the United States, focusing on the corpora of news articles from the left, center, and right of the political spectrum. The analysis is conducted using GPT-2, a language model, to compare the temporal shifts in language use. The video highlights the significant changes in language patterns, particularly in the use of negative and positive sentiment, and the shift in the use of the word "Trump." The video also discusses the implications of these changes for understanding the political discourse during these periods.</sample>
    <sample id="1103">The speaker discusses the results of a study on language models and their political leaning. They present a chart titled "The Trump Card," which shows the political leaning of language models before and after the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The chart is divided into two sections: "Pre-45th to post-45th shift" and "reddit left," "reddit center," and "reddit right." The speaker explains that the chart shows a shift in political leaning for language models, with a significant increase in leaning towards the right after the election. They also mention that language models generally had a political leaning that was further away from the center after 2017. The speaker concludes by stating that language models can pick up on the polarization in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1104">The video presents a detailed analysis of the performance of language models in detecting hate speech and misinformation targeting different identity groups. The analysis is conducted using a table that compares the performance of various models across different identity groups and sources of misinformation. The table is color-coded, with dark yellow indicating the best performance and dark blue indicating the worst. The video highlights the importance of evaluating language models with different political leanings, as these models are often used in applications that can have significant implications.</sample>
    <sample id="1105">The video presents a detailed analysis of hate speech targeting different identity groups and misinformation from various sources. The analysis is conducted using a table that categorizes hate speech into six groups: Black, Muslim, LGBTQ+, Jews, Asain, and Latinx. The table also includes data on misinformation from different sources such as HP, NYT, CNN, NPR, Guardian, Fox, WAXE, BBART, and WAT. The results are color-coded, with dark yellow indicating the best performance and dark blue indicating the worst. The video highlights that the performance of hate speech targeting different identity groups varies significantly across different sources. For example, hate speech targeting Black individuals is more prevalent on HP, while hate speech targeting Muslim individuals is more prevalent on NYT. The video also shows that misinformation from different sources has a significant impact on the performance of hate speech targeting different identity groups. For example, misinformation from HP has a significant impact on the performance of hate</sample>
    <sample id="1106">The video presents a detailed analysis of hate speech detection performance across different identity groups and misinformation sources. It begins with a slide titled 'Per-Category Performance,' displaying a table (Table 4) that compares the performance of various models in detecting hate speech targeting different identity groups and misinformation from different sources. The table uses a color-coded system to indicate performance levels, with dark yellow representing the best performance and dark blue representing the worst.

The table is divided into two main sections: 'Hate Speech' and 'Misinformation.' Under 'Hate Speech,' the models are evaluated on their ability to detect hate speech targeting specific identity groups, including Black, Muslim, LGBTQ+, Jews, Asain, Latinx, Women, Christian, Men, and White. The performance metrics are shown in percentages, with higher percentages indicating better performance.

Under 'Misinformation,' the models are evaluated on their ability to identify misinformation from different sources, including HP (Hate Speech), NYT (New York Times), CNN (Cable News Network), NPR (National Public Radio), Guardian (The Guardian), Fox (Fox News), WAXE (WAXE News), BBART (Big Bird AI), WAT (Watson AI), and NR (No Response). Similar to the 'Hate Speech' section, the performance metrics are shown in percentages, with higher values indicating better performance.

The video highlights that for hate speech detection, left-leaning language models tend to perform better, while for misinformation detection, right-leaning language models tend to perform better. This pattern is consistent across different identity groups and misinformation sources.

The video concludes by summarizing the findings and emphasizing the importance of understanding the performance of different models in detecting hate speech and misinformation. It suggests that the choice of model may depend on the specific context and the type of content being analyzed.</sample>

    <sample id="1110">The video presents a detailed analysis of hate speech detection performance across different identity groups and misinformation sources. The analysis is conducted using a table that compares the performance of various models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, on detecting hate speech targeting specific identity groups such as Black, Muslim, LGBTQ+, Jews, and others. The results are color-coded, with dark yellow indicating the best performance and dark blue indicating the worst.

The video highlights that the performance of these models varies significantly across different identity groups and misinformation sources. For instance, the DistilBERT model shows the best performance in detecting hate speech targeting the Black community, while the RoBERTa model performs best in detecting hate speech targeting the Muslim community. The BERT model, on the other hand, shows the worst performance in detecting hate speech targeting the Jewish community.

The video also discusses the impact of misinformation sources on hate speech detection. It notes that the performance of these models is generally better in detecting hate speech from their opposite political leaning sources. For example, the DistilBERT model shows the best</sample>

    <sample id="1130">The answer is C.</sample>
    <sample id="1131">so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1132">The video discusses the challenges of evaluating context-dependent translation. It highlights that only a small portion of translations depend on context, making corpus-level metrics like BLEU unable to capture these translations effectively.</sample>
    <sample id="1133">The video discusses the challenges of evaluating context-dependent translation. It highlights that only a small portion of words depend on context, and existing methods like corpus-level metrics support limited discourse phenomena and languages. The video also mentions that some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations, but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages, as they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation.</sample>
    <sample id="1134">The speaker introduces the topic of the video, which is to address two specific questions related to translation and context.</sample>
    <sample id="1135">To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context during translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1136">The video introduces Conditional Cross-Mutual Information (CXMI) as a measure for assessing how much context is utilized by machine translation models. It explains that CXMI quantifies the information provided by the context \( C \) about the target \( Y \) given the source \( X \). The video then delves into the concept of uncertainty in machine translation, illustrating how it is calculated and how it relates to the context. The video also discusses the relationship between the uncertainty of translations given the source and the context, and how this relationship is quantified using CXMI.</sample>
    <sample id="1137">You can think of CXMI as the information gained from giving context to the model.</sample>
    <sample id="1138">In this work, we extend CXMI to pointwise CXMI, which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. We can think of words that have high pointwise CXMI as ones that require context for translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1139">The speaker is discussing the use of high-precision XMI (eXtensible Markup Language) to analyze words with high precision. The goal is to identify patterns between these words. This analysis likely involves examining the relationships and connections between words to understand their usage and context better.</sample>
    <sample id="1140">English	and we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks uh that have been translated from english to fourteen different languages</sample>
    <sample id="1141">The video begins with a slide titled "Thematic analysis of high P-CXMI words" and the TED logo. The slide lists several languages, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Turkish, and Chinese. The next slide introduces the first level of analysis, which is POS tags. The slide states, "We perform our analysis at three different levels. First, we look at part of speech tags that have high means P-CXMI."</sample>
    <sample id="1142">The video presents a thematic analysis of high P-CXMI (Pointwise Mutual Information) words, focusing on Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. The analysis is conducted on a dataset of English-Arabic parallel corpora. The video highlights the differences in POS tag distributions between the two languages, particularly emphasizing the presence of dual pronouns in Arabic, which are absent in English. This difference is attributed to the grammatical structure of Arabic, where dual pronouns are used to indicate pairs of people or things. The video also discusses the implications of these differences for machine translation and other natural language processing tasks, suggesting that understanding the POS tag distributions can help improve the accuracy of these tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1143">The video presents a thematic analysis of high P-CXMI words, focusing on Part-of-Speech (POS) tags and vocabulary items. It begins with a bar chart showing the POS tags for pronouns, dual, and plural forms in English-Arabic, highlighting that pronouns have the highest P-CXMI. The analysis then shifts to vocabulary items, identifying pronouns and verb forms as significant contributors to P-CXMI. The video emphasizes the importance of context in selecting appropriate verb forms and concludes with a discussion on the role of context in language use.</sample>
    <sample id="1144">And this helps us identify cases like the one here where in Chinese you need context to translate proper nouns uh to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document.</sample>

    <sample id="1147">The video begins with a slide titled "Thematic analysis of high P-CXMI words." It lists three main points: 1) POS tags, 2) Vocabulary items, and 3) Individual tokens. A sentence in English and German is shown, highlighting the differences in word order and pronouns. The slide then introduces two research questions: 1) When does translation require context? and 2) How well do models handle context-dependent translations? The first question is answered with two points: word-level context usage and thematic analysis. The second question is answered with the mention of the Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) benchmark. The video continues with a slide that reiterates the two research questions. The first question is answered with the same two points: word-level context usage and thematic</sample>
    <sample id="1148">For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the Multilingual Discourse-Aware or MuDA tagger.</sample>
    <sample id="1149">We can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena.</sample>
    <sample id="1150" />
    <sample id="1151" />
    <sample id="1152">First of all, when we use corpus-level metrics, uh so for blue we find that context-aware models have the best performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1153" />
    <sample id="1154">This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone.</sample>

The table is divided into two sections: the upper part lists the alignment methods with 1:1 capabilities, while the lower part lists those with n:m capabilities. Each method is described with a brief explanation, and the table includes columns for Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1 score (F1). The presenter discusses the performance of each method, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each. He emphasizes the importance of choosing the right alignment method based on the specific requirements of the task at hand. The video provides a comprehensive overview of the different alignment methods, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of natural language processing.</sample>

    <sample id="1192">The speaker is discussing the results of an experiment on automatic text simplification, specifically comparing the performance of two different models: long-mBART and fine-tuned mBART. The results are presented in two tables: one for document-level simplification and one for sentence-level simplification. The speaker highlights the differences in performance between the two models, noting that long-mBART performs better on document-level simplification, while fine-tuned mBART performs better on sentence-level simplification. The speaker also mentions that the results are based on the DEPLAN-API test set, which consists of 48 documents and 1,846 sentences. The speaker encourages viewers to explore the checkpoints and more details in the paper, including the scores and evaluation metrics of the experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1193">The speaker discusses the results of their study on automatic text simplification, specifically focusing on the performance of their model, DEPLAN, on document and sentence-level simplification tasks. They present detailed metrics and compare their model's performance against baseline models. The speaker concludes that their model can achieve better scores than the baseline models, particularly on the document-level task.</sample>
    <sample id="1194">The video presents a detailed analysis of the performance of a text simplification model, focusing on both document-level and sentence-level results. The presenter discusses the model's performance on the DEPLAN-API test dataset, comparing different training data lengths and their impact on the model's ability to simplify text.

    <sample id="1212">The speaker is discussing different sampling methods used in a research context. They explain that as we move higher in the list of sampling methods, the entities become more similar to each other, making it more challenging to distinguish between them. This is a common issue in natural language processing tasks, where entities with similar names or descriptions can be difficult to differentiate. The speaker is likely discussing strategies to address this challenge, such as using more sophisticated sampling techniques or incorporating additional contextual information to improve disambiguation.</sample>

    <sample id="1218">The speaker is discussing the process of gathering background knowledge for music annotation. They explain that the first step is to search for each song on Google and click on the link to find out more about it. The second step is to ask annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song. The speaker then provides an example of the Google search result for the song "Easy On Me" by Adele.</sample>
    <sample id="1219">For the recipes and books domain, we show some background text from Wikipedia. For recipes, we additionally show their images again from Wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like.</sample>

    <sample id="1229">Hello everyone, I'm Jenny, a first-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting my work on NLPositionality, which characterizes design biases of datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="1230">This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastien Santi, Ronan Le Bras, Katharina Reinecke, and Maarten Sap.</sample>
    <sample id="1231">so let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic content</sample>
    <sample id="1232">You might turn towards a popular API like Perspective API for toxicity detection, and this works really well if you're Carl Jones, where Perspective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances.</sample>
    <sample id="1233" />
    <sample id="1234">This is an example of a design bias where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations.</sample>
    <sample id="1235">Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences.</sample>
    <sample id="1236">The video discusses the concept of **positionality**, which is widely used in critical studies, particularly in feminist and queer academic spaces. Positionality refers to the perspectives individuals hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences. This concept is crucial for understanding how personal backgrounds shape one's viewpoint and influence research and analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="1237" />
    <sample id="1238">Do datasets and models have positionality?</sample>
    <sample id="1239">The video discusses the concept of 'positionality' in relation to datasets and models. It explains that while models and datasets do not have demographic identities or life experiences, they aggregate judgments and opinions of real people, which can represent certain positionalities over others. The video also references several studies that explore the impact of biases in language technology and the importance of considering diverse perspectives in data collection and model development.</sample>
    <sample id="1240">The speaker discusses the concept of model positionality, which refers to the inherent biases and limitations of models based on the data they are trained on. The video highlights the importance of understanding and addressing these biases to ensure fair and accurate AI systems.</sample>
    <sample id="1241">The speaker discusses the topic of whether datasets and models have positionality, referencing three key works: Blasi et al. (2022), Yin et al. (2022), and Cambo &amp; Gergle (2022). These works explore the concept of model and dataset probing, as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality. However, the speaker notes that these works do not focus on comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves.</sample>
    <sample id="1242">The speaker discusses the importance of studying model and dataset positionality in the context of NLP tasks becoming more subjective and socially oriented.</sample>
    <sample id="1243">It's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind APIs.</sample>
    <sample id="1244">so to study dataset and model positionality we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models</sample>
    <sample id="1245">We do this through our framework, NL Positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1246">First, we collect data from various sources, such as surveys, interviews, and social media. Then, we process the data using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between different variables. Finally, we analyze the results to draw conclusions and make predictions about future trends.</sample>
    <sample id="1247">The first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators.</sample>
    <sample id="1248">The speaker discusses the importance of re-annotating datasets with diverse annotators, especially when the original datasets have limited demographic information.</sample>
    <sample id="1249" />
    <sample id="1250">We then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using Pearson's R correlation score.</sample>
    <sample id="1251" />
    <sample id="1252" />
    <sample id="1253" />
    <sample id="1254">We host two tasks on lab in the wild, one of them being social acceptability. And the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry dataset and then they'll rate how socially acceptable a situation is.</sample>
    <sample id="1255">Participants compare their responses to an AI and others.</sample>
    <sample id="1256">We then compared these annotations with Social Chemistry, Delphi, and GPT-4.</sample>
    <sample id="1257">We then replicate a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task, where they'll read an instance from DynaHate and write whether they think it's an instance of hate speech.</sample>
    <sample id="1258">We then compared these annotations with Dynahate, Perspective API, Rewire API, Hate Roberta, and GPT-4. Our study amassed over 16,000 annotations from over 1,000 annotators from 87 countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1259">The speaker is discussing the alignment between NLP datasets and models, and they have found that there is a positional relationship in NLP.</sample>

    <sample id="1262" />
    <sample id="1263">Finding 2: Some populations are left behind.</sample>
    <sample id="1264">An example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts. We find this in the GPT-4 social acceptability task as well as the DynaHate task analysis as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1265">Chinese	so given that there is positionality in nlp what can we do about it</sample>
    <sample id="1266">The first recommendation is to keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process. The second recommendation is to do NLP research through the lens of perspectivism, which involves sharing disaggregated dataset labels and using modeling techniques that can handle annotator disagreement.</sample>
    <sample id="1267" />
    <sample id="1268" />
    <sample id="1269">After the first step, we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered. that's why in the second step we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order.</sample>
    <sample id="1270">The authors recommend that model owners should increase transparency about the bias mitigation methods because it is unclear whether positive stereotypes are a result of overly excessive value alignment or anti-stereotyping methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1271">Minimal-pair unacceptable inputs are sentences that are grammatically incorrect or do not follow the expected language rules.</sample>

    <sample id="1352">hi, my name is adam przepiorkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="1353">The video discusses different dependency structures assumed by various theories and corpus approaches. It specifically highlights the Universal Dependencies structure, which represents the coordination of "Lisa, Bart, and Maggie" as a single unit. The video also mentions other structures like Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London, each with its own way of representing the coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="1354" />
    <sample id="1355">English	a similar approach is assumed in igor milchuk's meaning text theory where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct so these two approaches are asymmetric right they they single out one of the conjuncts</sample>
    <sample id="1356">The video discusses different approaches to coordinate structures in dependency grammar. It mentions Bouquet/Stanford's universal dependencies, Chain/Moscow's approach, Conjunction-headed/Prague's approach, and Multi-headed/London's approach. The video also introduces symmetric approaches to coordinate structures, such as the Prague approach, which assumes in-prague dependency treebanks where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction.</sample>
    <sample id="1357" />
    <sample id="1358">The video presents a detailed explanation of different dependency structures used in coordination within linguistic frameworks. It begins with an introduction to the topic, followed by a slide that outlines four primary dependency structures: Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies), Chain/Moscow, Conjunction-headed/Prague, and Multi-headed/London. Each structure is explained with examples, highlighting their unique characteristics and applications. The video emphasizes the importance of understanding these structures for accurate linguistic analysis and interpretation.</sample>
    <sample id="1359" />
    <sample id="1360">okay</sample>
    <sample id="1361">The argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization, which will be explained on the basis of these examples.</sample>
    <sample id="1362">The speaker explains that in English, direct objects tend to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away.</sample>
    <sample id="1363">The speaker is explaining the concept of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) in the context of sentence structure. They are discussing how the order of words in a sentence can affect the length of dependencies between words, which is a key principle in DLM. The speaker uses the example sentence "While March read yesterday it is much worse" to illustrate this point. They point out that the word "yesterday" is an adverb that modifies the verb "read," and it is placed between the verb and the direct object "it." This creates a longer dependency chain, which is less efficient and goes against the DLM principle of minimizing dependency lengths. The speaker then suggests a better word order for the sentence, which would be "While March read it yesterday, it is much worse." This revised sentence has a shorter dependency chain, making it more efficient and easier to understand.</sample>
    <sample id="1364">English	however this effect may be ameliorated uh when um uh when the um direct object is very heavy and very long uh because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct</sample>
    <sample id="1365">The video presents a detailed explanation of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) in the context of natural language processing. It begins with a slide titled "Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)" and introduces the concept with a visual representation of a sentence structure. The slide highlights the importance of minimizing dependency lengths to improve the clarity and coherence of sentences. The video then transitions to a slide with the same title, displaying a sentence in German: "Marge liest gerade das Buch über die Bienen." The slide emphasizes the dependency structure of the sentence, showing how the words are connected and how the length of dependencies can affect the readability of the sentence. The video continues with a slide that presents a comparison between two sentences: "Marge read it yesterday" and "Marge read this absolutely fascinating book about the bees yesterday." The slide highlights the difference in dependency lengths between the two sentences, with the second sentence having a shorter dependency length. The video then explains the concept of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) and its importance in natural language processing. It discusses how DLM can be used to improve the clarity and coherence of sentences by minimizing the length of dependencies. The video also provides examples of how DLM can be applied to different languages, including German and English. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM)</sample>
    <sample id="1366">The speaker discusses the concept of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) in the context of word order in sentences. They explain that DLM tends to minimize dependency lengths, meaning that words that are more closely related in meaning are placed closer together in the sentence. The speaker provides examples of sentences with different word orders and highlights the differences in dependency lengths. They also mention that while DLM is a common tendency in language, it is not always the case and that other factors can influence word order.</sample>
    <sample id="1367">okay</sample>
    <sample id="1368">The video presents a detailed explanation of the Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) principle in natural language processing. It begins with a visual representation of a sentence structure, highlighting the word order and dependencies. The narrator explains that DLM aims to minimize the length of dependencies in a sentence, which is crucial for efficient parsing and understanding. The video uses examples to illustrate how different word orders affect the dependency lengths, demonstrating that shorter dependencies are preferred. The narrator emphasizes that DLM is a key principle in syntactic parsing and is widely used in various natural language processing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1369">The speaker is explaining the concept of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) in the context of natural language processing. DLM is a principle that suggests that the order of words in a sentence tends to minimize the length of the critical dependencies, which are the dependencies that are not constant across different sentence structures. The speaker uses two trees to illustrate this concept, showing how the order of words can affect the length of the critical dependencies. The first tree represents a sentence with a longer critical dependency, while the second tree represents a sentence with a shorter critical dependency. The speaker explains that the second tree is more efficient because it minimizes the length of the critical dependencies, which can improve the performance of natural language processing algorithms.</sample>
    <sample id="1370" />
    <sample id="1371">The speaker is explaining the concept of Dependency Length Minimization (DLM) in linguistics. They use an example sentence to illustrate how moving or swapping certain words can affect the dependency structure and the overall length of dependencies in a sentence. The speaker highlights that while this change may violate one principle, it satisfies another, emphasizing the trade-offs involved in linguistic structures.</sample>
    <sample id="1372">The speaker discusses the extraction of statistics about coordination from an enhanced version of the Penn Treebank. They mention that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, and this tendency grows with length difference. The speaker also notes that this pattern is observed when the governor is on the left or absent, but not when it is on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="1373">The video discusses the length of left conjunctions in English, referencing statistics from the Penn Treebank. It highlights that left conjunctions tend to be shorter, especially when the governor is absent, as seen in examples like "not when it is on the right [Ted and Ned laughed]". The video also mentions that this trend grows with length difference and is observed in both written and spoken language.</sample>
    <sample id="1374">The speaker is discussing the statistical observation that left conjuncts tend to be shorter than right conjuncts in English. This tendency becomes more pronounced as the length difference between the two conjuncts increases. The speaker references studies by Marcus et al. (1993) and Ficler and Goldberg (2010) to support this observation. Additionally, the speaker notes that this trend is not always consistent, as seen in examples where the governor is on the left or absent, such as "I saw Bert and Lisa Hone come and sneeze" versus "not when it's on the right [Ted and Ned laughed]."</sample>
    <sample id="1375">right so the proportion is is is bigger of of the left uh short conjunctions</sample>
    <sample id="1376">The novelty in this paper is that the observed tendency for left conjuncts to be shorter than right conjuncts only occurs when the governor is on the left or absent. This is a new finding that adds to the existing knowledge about the length difference between left and right conjuncts in English.</sample>
    <sample id="1377">right so the governor is on the left in this example i saw bart and lisa so is the governor is on the left</sample>
    <sample id="1378">The left conjunct prefers to be shorter, and the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1379">The video begins with a slide titled "Conjunct Lengths in English," presenting statistics about coordination extracted from an enhanced version of the Penn Treebank. The slide highlights that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, this tendency grows with length difference, and it is observed only when the governor is on the left or absent. An example sentence is provided: "I saw Bart and Lisa. Homer came and sneezed." The slide also notes that this effect disappears when the governor is on the right, as in the sentence "Ted and Ned laughed." The slide is visually structured with a blue header, white background, and black text, with key points highlighted in green. The speaker discusses the statistical trends in English coordination, emphasizing the role of the governor in determining the length of conjuncts. The slide then transitions to a new slide with a blue header and white background, displaying a graph titled "Figure 1. Proportion of shorter conjuncts depending on the absolute difference of conjunct lengths (with confidence bands)." The graph shows four subplots, each representing different conditions: "NO governor on LEFT (CHARACTERS)," "NO governor on LEFT (SYLLABLES)," "NO governor on RIGHT (CHARACTERS)," and "NO governor on RIGHT (SYLLABLES)." Each subplot contains a line graph with data points and confidence bands, illustrating the proportion of shorter conjuncts based on the absolute difference of conjunct lengths. The x-axis represents the absolute difference of conjunct lengths, ranging from 0 to 100, while the y-axis represents the proportion of shorter conjuncts, ranging from 0 to 1. The graphs show that the proportion of shorter conjuncts is higher when the governor is on the left and lower when the governor is on the right. The confidence bands indicate the variability in the data. The speaker explains that the effect of the governor on the length of conjuncts disappears when the governor is on the right, which is consistent with the previous slide's observation. The video continues with a slide featuring a blue header and white background, displaying a speaker in a black shirt and glasses, standing in front of a dark background. The speaker is positioned on the right side of the slide, with a small image of the speaker in the top left corner. The slide is visually structured with a clean and professional design, focusing on the speaker's presentation. The speaker discusses the findings from the previous slide, emphasizing that the effect of the governor on the length</sample>
    <sample id="1380">The speaker discusses the relationship between the absolute difference in length of words and the proportion of shorter left governors. They mention that the data is divided into three columns: characters, syllables, and words, with the right column focusing on words. The speaker notes that the proportion of shorter left governors increases as the absolute difference in length of words increases. They also mention that the data is divided into three columns, with the right column focusing on words.</sample>
    <sample id="1381">When the governor is on the left, we see that the proportion of shorter left conjuncts increases as the absolute difference in length between the left and right conjuncts increases. This trend is consistent across all three measures of length: characters, syllables, and words. The confidence bands, represented by the shaded areas, show the range of uncertainty in the estimates. The lines within the confidence bands represent the mean proportion of shorter left conjuncts for each absolute difference in length. The graph suggests that as the difference in length between the left and right conjunct increases, the likelihood of the left conjunct being shorter also increases.</sample>
    <sample id="1382">The tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words, and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences, but when the governor is on the right, this tendency disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1383">The speaker discusses the compatibility of different dependency structures of coordination with the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework. They present four examples: Bouquet/Stanford (Universal Dependencies), Chain/Moscow (No), Conjunction-headed/Prague (Yes), and Multi-headed/London (Yes). The speaker argues that the UD framework is more compatible with symmetric structures of coordination, as shown in the examples of Conjunction-headed/Prague and Multi-headed/London, compared to asymmetric structures like Bouquet/Stanford and Chain/Moscow.</sample>

    <sample id="1532">Answer: So with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way.</sample>
    <sample id="1533">The speaker discusses the effectiveness of instruction tuning in enabling large language models to perform on unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1534">Answer: The previous works on instruction tuning mainly focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multimodal tasks have been left out.</sample>
    <sample id="1535">The video discusses the topic of instruction tuning on multimodal pre-trained models, specifically focusing on their potential to enhance generalization to unseen multimodal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1536">The video discusses the imbalance in instructional datasets between NLP and multimodal. The speaker mentions that at the time of their research, they discovered a significant disparity in the availability of instruction datasets between NLP and multimodal. They also highlight that there are over 1600 language-only instruction tasks available.</sample>
    <sample id="1537" />
    <sample id="1538">Here we present multi instruct, the first multimodal instruction tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multimodal tasks covering 10 broad categories and 5 expert-written instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1539">The tasks are derived from 21 existing open-source datasets, and each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1540">For investigating multi-modal instruction tuning on our proposed dataset, we take OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as our base model. OFA uses a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens, and the coordinates of a bounding box.</sample>
    <sample id="1541">okay</sample>
    <sample id="1542" />
    <sample id="1543">We follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format, in which the input text, images, instruction, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space.</sample>
    <sample id="1544">okay now i'm gonna talk about multi model instruction tuning</sample>
    <sample id="1545">For the training dataset, we use 53 tasks from 9 groups for training and sample 10,000 instances per task. For the testing dataset, we reserve the entire Commonsense Reasoning group for testing and select additional 5 tasks from VQA and Miscellaneous groups. We randomly sample 20 tasks from the test split of the Natural Instructions dataset as unseen tasks for NLP.</sample>
    <sample id="1546" />
    <sample id="1547">so we use a pre-trained ofa-large model as a base model during training we mix all the instances for all the tasks each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction template</sample>
    <sample id="1548">We report the mean and maximum performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1549">We report the mean and maximum performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1550">For multi-modal classification tasks, we report accuracy. For multi-modal generation tasks, we report Rouge-L. For NLP tasks, we report Rouge-L as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1551">We also introduced an additional evaluation metric called sensitivity, which measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task, regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction.</sample>
    <sample id="1552">thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="1553" />
    <sample id="1554">As the amount of task increase, the model achieves better performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1555">The video presents a study on the effect of diverse instructions on instruction tuning, specifically focusing on the performance of a model called Malibushin. The study compares the performance of the model when fine-tuned with one instruction versus five instructions. The results show that fine-tuning with five instructions achieves much higher aggregated performance on all evaluation tasks and shows lower sensitivity. The video also highlights the importance of using diverse instructions to improve the model's performance and reduce its sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1556">Chinese	so this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategy on the model sensitivity uh as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction data set the model can  uh achieve much better sensitivity comparing to the original ofa model</sample>
    <sample id="1557">The video presents a detailed analysis of the performance of different models on zero-shot NLP tasks, focusing on the impact of instruction tuning and transfer learning strategies. It begins by highlighting the performance of the OFA model, which achieves a score of 12.18 on the zero-shot task. The video then introduces the concept of instruction tuning, demonstrating that it can significantly improve the performance of unseen NLP tasks. Specifically, the video shows that instruction tuning on Multilnstruct can enhance the performance of the OFA model from 12.18 to 12.25. Additionally, the video discusses the transfer learning strategy called Mixedlnstruct, which is designed to preserve the zero-shot capability gained from the Natural Instructions dataset. The video concludes by presenting a table that summarizes the performance of various models on the zero-shot task, with the best performance highlighted in bold. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of instruction tuning and transfer learning strategies on the performance of NLP models on zero-shot tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1558">The speaker is presenting the conclusion of their research, which involves the development of a large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset. The dataset significantly improves the zero-shot capability of OFA (Open Fine-Grained Visual Attribute) and explores various transfer learning techniques, demonstrating their benefits. Additionally, the speaker mentions the design of a new metric called sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1559">One More Thing! We are collecting a much larger multimodal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional vision-language tasks and we will release them soon! This is a QR code for our data and model. Thank you.</sample>
