    <sample id="2">Hello everyone, I am Tu Yi from Ant Group, presenting our paper on document understanding. The co-authors are all algorithm engineers from Ant Group, and the paper is based on our working practice. We focus on the Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) problem, which involves understanding various types of documents like forms, receipts, and posters. Recent pre-training techniques have been introduced into this area, and self-supervised pre-training multi-modal models like LayoutMask have demonstrated great successes in VrDU tasks.

Existing document pre-training models suffer from reading order issues, as they usually adopt ascending numbers to represent the global reading order of tokens in a document. LayoutMask proposes a novel pre-trained model that only uses text and layout information as model input. It enhances text layout interactions and layout representations learned during pre- training. LayoutMask differs from previous studies in three aspects: choice 1D position, masking strategy, and  pre-training objectives.

Instead of global 1D position, LayoutMask uses in-segment token orders as 1D positions, referred to as "local 1D position." This approach does not provide cross-segment orders, so LayoutMask is supposed to infer global reading order using 1D position, 2D positions, and semantic information. To further promote text-layout interactions, we equip the commonly used pre-training task, Masked Language Modeling, with two novel strategies: Whole Word Masking and Layout-Awared Masking.

We also designed a new pre-training objective, Mask-Aware Position Modeling (MPM), which has a symmetric pre-training objective: recovering randomly 2D masked positions during pre-training. The MPM task promotes text-layout interactions and helps the model learn better layout representations.

In our experiments, we compare the performance of Layout- Mask using different layout information. For 1D positions, Local-1D outperforms Global-1 D on both FUNSD and SROIE, but falls a little behind on CORD. The main reason for the performance gap is the entity "Total," which is hard to recognize using the ordinary reading order implied by Global- 1D. Based on this result, we conclude that using Local-1D can perform  better since it is more adaptive to such cases</sample>

    <sample id="6">Jiaan and their team present a unified approach to multilingual and cross-lingual summarization, introducing the concept of many-to-many summarization. This method aims to create a single summarization model capable of processing documents in any source language and generating summaries in any target language. The team conducted preliminary studies to compare multilingual summarization, cross-lingual summarIZATION, and their many-to-many summarization, finding that the latter enhances task knowledge transfer across languages. They proposed PISCES, a pre-trained many- to-many summarization model, trained through a three-stage pre-training process: meta pre-training, cross-lingual pre-training, and task-specific pre-training. Experiments on the WikiLingua dataset, which includes English, French, Hindi, Chinese, and Thai, showed that the many-to-many summarization model outperformed existing models. The team also conducted ablation studies and human evaluations to validate the effectiveness of their approach. The paper details the findings and results, highlighting the superiority of their many-to-many summarization model and PISCES.</sample>
    <sample id="7">Yes, CoNLL-2003 tagger models still work well in 2023, as demonstrated by the study. The research found that transformer models, larger model sizes, and more fine-tuning examples are needed for good generalization. The performance drop observed in some models is mainly due to temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting.</sample>
    <sample id="8">The novelty of the proposed human evaluation method, ABC-Eval, lies in its ability to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by specifically annotating whether each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as irrelevant information, contradictions, hallucinations, and empathy. This approach allows for a more precise and reliable measurement of multiple dimensions of chat quality, providing a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of chat models. ABC-Eval measures rates of thematic errors and has been shown to be more reliable and informative than existing methods, such as Likert ratings and pairwise comparisons, in predicting overall conversation quality.</sample>
    <sample id="9">The success of existing weakly supervised learning (WSL) approaches heavily relies on clean, manually annotated validation samples. Without these clean validation samples, the models tend to overfit to the weak labels and do not generalize well. Additionally, increasing the number of clean validation samples improves performance, and continuing fine-tuning on these clean samples can achieve even better results.</sample>
    <sample id="10">To improve the score, the following advances can be considered:

1. **Enhanced Background Knowledge**: Providing more comprehensive and accurate background information about the entities can help the language model make better disambiguation decisions.

2. **Improved Contextual Understanding**: Enhancing the model's ability to understand and utilize contextual information from the dialogue can lead to more accurate entity selection.

3. **Better Sampling Methods**: Refining the sampling methods to ensure a more balanced and challenging set of examples can help the model generalize better.

4. **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data can improve its performance in specific contexts, such as music, books, or recipes.

5. **Advanced Disambiguation Techniques**: Implementing more sophisticated disambiguation techniques, such as leveraging additional features or using more complex models, can improve accuracy.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback**: Incorporating feedback from human annotators to continuously improve the model's performance can lead to better results.

7. **Multimodal Inputs**: Utilizing multimodal inputs, such as images or audio, can provide additional context and improve the model's ability to disambiguate entities.

8. **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging transfer learning from related tasks or domains can help the model generalize better and improve its performance.

By addressing these areas, the accuracy and performance of the language model can be significantly improved.</sample>
    <sample id="11">Jack Hessel from AI2 presents a study on the ability of large language models to understand humor, using data from The New Yorker Caption Contest. The study includes three tasks: matching, quality ranking, and explanation generation. The best model, CLIP fine-tuned on the annotated corpus, achieves 62% accuracy on the matching task, compared to humans' 94%. When conditioning language models like GPT-4 with human-authored descriptions, there is still a significant performance gap. The study also highlights errors in GPT-4's joke explanations, with human explanations preferred in more than two-thirds of cases.

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presented his work on "Finding the SWEET Spot: Analysis of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings" at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Adaptive inference is a technique to reduce the inference time of large language models by using low-capacity models for easy samples. The two most common adaptive inference methods are Multimodel and Early Exit. Multimodel stores multiple models and runs them sequentially until a classifier halts the computation, while Early Exit runs a sample through the model until a classifier halts, saving computation. However, Early Exit suffers from conflicting gradients, where each classifier updates model weights, potentially harming the performance of all classifiers involved. To address this, Daniel proposed SWEET, a novel fine-tuning method for Early Exit architectures that separates weights in each layer, avoiding conflicting gradients. SWEET closes most of the gap between early exit and multimodel, but later classifiers are negatively affected. The results show that SWEET outperforms both methods in fast speeds and throughout the entire speed/accuracy curve for BERT-Large. The takeaways from the work are the existence of conflicting gradients in early exit training, the first fair comparison of early exit and multimodel adaptive inference methods, and the introduction of SWEET, which motivates future research and fine-tuning algorithms tailored to the early exit architecture.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Hi everyone, I'm Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student from NUS, and I'm excited to present our work on multimodal relation extraction. Relation extraction is a task that determines the semantic relationship between entities in a text. However, in realistic scenarios like social media, data is often in various forms and modalities, making it challenging to understand ambiguous or multi-context words. To address this, we introduced multimodal relation extraction, which combines textual and visual evidence.

Our approach addresses two main issues: internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation. We propose a Graph Information Bottleneck principle-guided feature refining to fine-tune the information from both modalities. Additionally, we incorporate multimodal topic information as supplementary context to enrich the overall understanding.

Our framework consists of five parts: representing text and image with scene graphs, merging them into a unified backbone cross-modal graph (CMG), screening the CMG structure, enriching the compressed features with multimodal topic features, and evaluating the method on a widely used MRE dataset.

Experiments show that our method outperforms text-based methods and achieves the best performance among multimodal baselines. Ablation studies reveal that internal-information screening and external-information exploiting both contribute to task performance. We also find that the performance screening is more important for high cross-modal relevance inputs, while external-information exploiting is more useful for lower relevance inputs.

In conclusion, we introduce a novel idea of simultaneous internal-information screening and external-information exploiting for multimodal relation extraction. Our system achieves significant improvements over existing models on benchmarks. Thank you for your attention, and you can scan the QR code for more information.</sample>
    <sample id="18">The example of the preference for shorter left conjuncts is "salt and pepper" versus "pepper and salt." In the first case, "salt" is the shorter left conjunct, while in the second case, "pepper" is the shorter left conjunct.

    <sample id="19">The presentation by Zhang Qin from Shenzhen University introduces their work, "A Survey for Efficient Open Domain Q&amp;A," which was accepted by ACL 2023, focusing on improving open-domain question answering systems. The traditional two-stage model by Danqi Chen involves retrieving evidence from a Wikipedia corpus and then reasoning out the answer. However, challenges include the large size of the corpus (26 million documents, 20 GB), the 65 GB index file, and the computational demands of multiple language models. The goal is to achieve efficient systems with lower memory costs, faster inference, and comparable performance.

Key techniques include:
1. Efficient retrieval using approximate nearest neighbor search.
2. Fast reading through methods like adaptive computation.
3. Reducing index size through document filtering, embedding, or product quantization.
4. Reducing model size via lightweight models, parameter sharing, or designing fewer models.

The analysis shows that retrieval-only systems are fast but require large indexes, while generator-only systems are large and perform poorly. The conclusion suggests that for resource-limited scenarios, retrieval-only systems or embedding compression are suitable, while retrieval and reader systems are better for balanced performance.

Future works include deploying systems on low-power devices and considering additional evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="22">The factors that lead to good generalization, as identified in the paper, are:

1. **Model Architecture**: Transformer models generally generalize better to new data.

These factors are interdependent, and all are necessary for achieving good generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="23">Dan Garrette discusses the challenges faced by text image models in rendering visual text, particularly focusing on the Imagen model. The Imagen model uses a T5-XXL encoder to encode text and a diffusion model to generate images. However, these models often struggle with representing text accurately, especially for simple words. T5 uses SentencePiece tokenization, breaking words into subword IDs, which makes it difficult for the model to decompose these chunks into individual letters. This results in poor spelling accuracy, with even the largest T5 model achieving less than 70% accuracy.

In contrast, PaLM models perform better at spelling due to their larger size and more training data, but they are impractical for many applications. ByT5, which receives individual bytes of the input string, has full access to spelling information and performs well across all scales. The study found that T5 struggles with the most frequent words, as they are often represented by a single vocabulary item or a couple subwords, requiring the model to decompose them into more letters. ByT5, however, can copy characters directly from the input to the output, unaffected by word frequency.

To improve text rendering, the researchers augmented the Imagen model with an additional text representation from ByT5-small, increasing the parameter count by only 5%. This small addition significantly improved the model's ability to spell and render text, although the diffusion model can still introduce errors. The main takeaways are the WikiSpell benchmark for text-only models and the DrawText benchmark for text-to-image models. The study introduces a new strategy for improving model spelling ability by concatenating a character-aware model.</sample>
    <sample id="24">The tendency for left conjuncts to be shorter was measured by comparing the length of dependencies from the governor to the adjunct and the governor to the first conjunct in coordination structures. The paper found that shorter dependencies are preferred, and this effect is stronger when the governor is on the left or absent, leading to the shorter left conjunct.</sample>
    <sample id="25">The experiments were designed to study the effect of the governor's position by analyzing the length of dependencies in coordination structures. The researchers measured the length of dependencies from the governor to the conjuncts in sentences with the governor on the left, the governor absent, and the governor on the right. They found that when the governor is on the left or absent, the shorter conjunct tends to be the first one, while when the governor is on the right, this effect disappears. This suggests that the governor's position affects the preference for the shorter conjunct in coordination structures.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The presentation introduces "LLM-Blender," a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework for large-language models. The framework is based on pairwise ranking and generative fusion, addressing the issue that no single model consistently outperforms others across all inputs. The team from AI2 and USC found that the optimal model varies per input example. LLM-Blender uses a two-stage process: first, it runs multiple models to generate outputs, then uses a pairwise ranking module called PairRanker to compare these outputs. PairRanker encodes pairs of candidates with the input to learn subtle differences. The results are aggregated using max logits or bubble sort. The framework is evaluated on the MixInstruct dataset, which includes instruction datasets and candidates from 11 open-source models. The results show that LLM-Blender significantly outperforms individual models and achieves better performance on various metrics. The key takeaway is that LLM-Blender is a simple, effective, and promising framework for ensemble learning in large language models.</sample>

    <sample id="33">The introduced framework, NLPositionality, quantifies the positionality of datasets and models by comparing the annotations made by diverse annotators with the predictions and labels generated by the models. This is done through a two-step process:

1. **Re-annotating Datasets with Diverse Annotators**: The framework re-annotates datasets with a large number of annotators from diverse backgrounds, including different countries, languages, and demographics. This helps to gather a rich set of annotations that reflect the perspectives of various populations.

2. **Comparing Annotations with Models and Datasets**: The framework then compares the re-annotated data with the predictions and labels generated by existing datasets and models. This is done using a Pearson's R correlation score, which measures the similarity between the annotations and the model predictions. By comparing the annotations with the models, the framework can identify how well the models align with the perspectives of different populations.

The framework differs from previous work by focusing on comparing the end users (annotators) with the models and datasets, rather than just looking at annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of how datasets and models represent different positionalities.

The study found that datasets and models are most aligned with English-speaking countries and people with a college education, but less aligned with non-binary individuals. This highlights the positionality in NLP and provides insights into how to address it.</sample>
    <sample id="34">Marcos Treviso presents "CREST: A Joint Framework for Rationalisation and Counterfactual Text Generation," a collaboration with Alexis Ross, Nuno Guerreira, and André Martins. CREST combines selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation to produce high-quality counterfactuals. The framework includes a rationalizer model that generates rationales and a counterfactual generator that edits the input to create counterfactual examples. CREST was evaluated using human judgment and found to produce more valid and natural counterfactuals than other methods. Additionally, CREST was used for data augmentation and rationalization with both factual and counterfactual inputs, leading to improved downstream models. The rationales generated by CREST were found to be more plausible and had higher counterfactual simulability than those generated by other methods. Overall, CREST is a promising approach for generating valid, fluent, and diverse counterfactual explanations.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The paper "Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual
Machine Translation" by Telmo Pessoa Pires et al. discusses the challenges and solutions in multilingual machine translation. The main points are:

1. Multilingual machine translation has advantages such as scalability, speed, and improved performance for low-resource language pairs, but it also has limitations like limited capacity per language and increased training and inference costs.
2. The authors propose Language-Specific Layers (LSLs) to increase capacity per language while keeping inference costs constant. LSLs are regular transformer layers per language, selected and trained at inference time based on the source or target language.
3. The authors explore LSL placement in the encoder, using a large model with shared, source, and target weights to learn the best placement. The approach involves selecting the component with the largest weight for each layer.
4. The authors evaluate their approach on WMT21 news translation mask sources, using chrF, spBLEU, and COMet metrics. They find significant improvements over baseline models and language adapters, with particularly large improvements for low-resource languages.
5. The authors also report results for shared and separate decoders, ablation studies, and different metrics, and find that their approach is statistically significant for 84 out of 90 translation directions.

Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to multilingual machine translation that increases capacity per language while keeping inference costs constant, and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models and language adapters.</sample>

    <sample id="41">Silin from EPFL University's Natural Language Processing Lab introduces "PeaCoK: Persona Commonsens Knowledge for Consistent and Engaging Narratives," a collaboration with Sony Group Corporation. The project aims to address the challenge of sustaining coherent and engaging narratives by representing real-world personas with rich world knowledge and complex interconnections. PeaCoK is a Persona-grounded Commonsens Knowledge Graph containing about 3,800 personas and over 40,000 distinctive attributes. These attributes form around 100,000 personal facts, with about 9,200 attributes connecting two or more personas.

The relations between personas and their attributes are framed in three dimensions, including four types of main relationships, interactivity, and distinctiveness. PeaCoK was built in three steps: selecting personas from existing commonsense graphs, inducing attributes from commonsense knowledge and pre-trained language models, and crowdsourcing annotations using a joint human-AI majority voting scheme, achieving 87% accuracy.

The graph's comprehensive coverage of world knowledge is questioned, but PeaCoK helps language models learn and generalize persona knowledge. A BART-based common knowledge generator trained on PeaCoK outperforms large-scale pre-trained language models like GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 in various natural language generation metrics and human evaluation.

PeaCoK's knowledge is also used to improve narrative modeling. A persona-grounded dialogue generation task on the ConvAIR2 PersonaChat dataset shows that PeaCoK-augmented models achieve better dialogue generation in fluency, consistency, engagement, and persona expression compared to the Atomic2020 knowledge graph. Human evaluation results indicate that the winning rates of PeaCoK-augmented models increase as the number of shared common attributes between speakers becomes larger, highlighting the importance of learning interconnected world persona knowledge in narratives.</sample>

    <sample id="54">Vasudha, a Computer Science PhD candidate at Stony Brook, presents their work on "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection" accepted at ACL 2023. Cognitive dissonance, the inconsistency between beliefs and actions, is a rare but significant phenomenon in language. Studying dissonance can help understand disagreement, mental health, extremism, and decision-making. To create a cognitive dissonance resource, Vasudha's team annotated 1,000 pairs of discourse units, finding dissonance in only 3.5%. They used transfer learning and active learning to address the rarity of dissonance data. By transferring weights from related tasks and iteratively fine-tuning, they achieved a zero-shot performance of AUC .62. They compared different active learning strategies and found that the Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy was most effective. With PRC, they improved dissonance classification AUC to 0.62 and further to 0.75. The team also found that PRC is a simple active learning strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting, while iterative update is useful for transfer learning from different domains.</sample>

The findings indicate that while clean validation samples are necessary for WSL approaches to work properly, increasing the number of clean validation samples can help achieve better performance. Additionally, allowing the model to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples can lead to performance improvements that are comparable to more complex WSL methods.

    <sample id="62">Nitay Calderon, along with Amir and Subhabrata from Microsoft, and his PhD advisor Roi, have conducted a systematic study on knowledge distillation for natural language generation (NLG) with pseudo-target training. The goal is to compress large NLG models while preserving their performance. The study explores various NLG tasks, including summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, and simplification/style transfer, using realistic setups with medium-resource labeled data, large amounts of unlabeled data, and medium-sized off-the-shelf models. The research focuses on inference time efficiency and negligible one-time training resources.

The study consists of eight stages, starting with architectural decisions and pruning impacts, followed by knowledge selection and state-of-the-art baselines. The main contribution is the exploration of pseudo-target extensions, challenging traditional sequence-level knowledge distillation. The authors show that unlabeled data, multiple pseudo-targets, and sampling techniques improve student performance. They also propose a novel technique called joint-teaching, which addresses student exposure bias and teaches the student to correct its own mistakes.

The study provides insights into task-specific knowledge distillation for NLG and offers a recipe for distillation in this field. The authors invite readers to discuss the paper and their poster, which provides more details about the study, methods, and first exposure bias motivation.</sample>

    <sample id="66">The paper "Deep Learning for Mathematical Reasoning" discusses the task of mathematical reasoning and the development and application of deep learning methods. Mathematical reasoning involves understanding and making decisions based on numerical data and language, and has been a focus of AI and NLP research. The paper explores two primary categories of mathematical reasoning: visual contexts, such as geometric problems, and tabular contexts. Solving geometric problems involves identifying geometric relations, applying theorems, and performing calculations. Automated theorem proving aims to demonstrate the truth of a mathematical claim through a sequence of arguments. The paper also discusses the use of neural network architectures, such as sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-tree models, for mathematical reasoning tasks. The development of pre-trained language models, such as large language models (LLMs), has shown remarkable performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, including math word problems. However, LLMs still face limitations, such as the lack of precise mathematical reasoning. The paper proposes solutions, such as self-consistency and program-aided LLMs, to improve the performance of LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks. Despite progress, mathematical reasoning in low-resource settings remains underexploited, and there is a need for more research in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="67">Uri discusses the issue of interference in multilingual translation models, where training to translate one language pair can either improve or degrade the quality of another. They identify that severe interference occurs when the model is small compared to the data size, and that adjusting the sampling temperature is crucial for strong performance. Uri's experiments show that language similarity and the number of languages do not significantly impact interference levels. They found that severe interference happens in parameter-poor settings and can be mitigated by using a modest scale and tuned temperature. The best way to control the trade-offs is through temperature sampling, with values greater than 1 allowing more training examples from lower-resource languages. Uri concludes that tuned temperature is key for strong performance, and that modest scale and tuned temperature can significantly reduce the problem without any specialized methods.</sample>
    <sample id="68">During pretraining, language models receive a vast amount of linguistic context from diverse sources, including books, websites, and other text corpora. This context is used to learn patterns, structures, and relationships within the language, enabling the models to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. The pretraining process involves exposure to a wide range of linguistic phenomena, such as grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, which helps the models develop a deep understanding of language. However, the specific linguistic context and the diversity of the training data can vary, influencing the models' performance and capabilities.</sample>

    <sample id="71">The presentation discusses the development of the AltEntities Corpus, a dataset designed to study indirect referring expressions for entity selection in conversational systems. The corpus includes 6,000 alternative questions across music, books, and recipes domains, with 42,000 indirect referring phrases. The dataset is created using a cartoon completion setup where annotators fill in indirect references to entities. The accuracy of language models varies depending on the background knowledge provided, with the highest accuracy (92-95%) when the model has access to the same knowledge as the annotators, and lower accuracy (60%) when only entity names are provided. The models are also shown to be domain-generalizable. The AltEntities Corpus is available for public use.</sample>
    <sample id="72">There is a need to develop new methods for measuring media bias because language models trained on large-scale web crawl data, which often include political news media, can inherit and propagate these biases. This can lead to unfair NLP applications, particularly in tasks like hate speech detection and fake news detection, where the performance of language models can vary significantly based on their political leanings. By understanding and addressing these biases, we can work towards more equitable and fair AI systems.</sample>

    <sample id="74">Hello everyone, I'm Xiangqing, and I'm here to introduce our paper, "Dense-ATOMIC." Our paper focuses on constructing a densely-connected commonsense knowledge graph, Dense-ATOMIC, to address the limitations of the existing ATOMIC knowledge base. ATOMIC has a sparse graph structure and lacks sufficient semantic information, making it difficult for GCNs to propagate information effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Rel-CSKGC, a relation prediction model that utilizes the pre-trained language model, RoBERTa, to encode head and tail events. We also introduce an Intra- and Inter-Cluster Completion Strategy to efficiently infer missing links. Our evaluations show that Dense-ATOMIC has higher knowledge coverage and benefits the performance of COMET, a commonsense reasoning model. We also demonstrate the potential of Dense-ATOMIC for commonsense reasoning. Thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="75">Zheng Yandan, along with her collaborators Hao Anran and Luu Anh Tuan, presents their work on Jointprop, a joint semi-supervised learning framework for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). The motivation behind their work stems from the need to address the limitations of fully-supervised models, which require extensive labeled data, and the potential of semi-supervised models, which use a small amount of labeled data to achieve powerful results at a lower cost. However, current semi-supervised approaches often overlook the interconnections between NER and RE tasks, which could lead to missed label alignments and incorrect inferences.

Jointprop aims to address this issue by modeling the NER and RE tasks as a joint problem, leveraging the relationships between labeled and unlabeled data. The framework consists of four parts: span feature generation (using contextualized representations of tokens), heterogeneous graph construction (creating a k-Nearest Neighbor graph to capture similarities between data points), joint label propagation (propagating labels through the graph), and model optimization (refining pseudo-labels and retraining the model).

Experiments conducted on four datasets, including joint-task and single-task datasets, demonstrate that Jointprop significantly outperforms baseline models for both NER and RE tasks, particularly on single-task datasets. The results highlight the benefits of joint learning and the potential of semi-supervised approaches in NER and RE.</sample>
    <sample id="76">The political bias propagation pipeline, as described in the presentation, involves several key steps:

1. **Evaluation of Political Leaning**: The first step is to evaluate the political leaning of language models. This is done by using political questionnaires and prompts, such as the political conference test, to automatically assess the models' biases. Preliminary results show that language models exhibit varying political leanings, with some models being more liberal than others.

2. **Investigation of Bias Source**: The next step is to investigate the extent to which the political biases of language models are derived from their training data. This is achieved through controlled experiments where language models are further pretrained on partisan corpora (news and social media) that are separated by political leaning. The results show that the ideological coordinates of the language models shift in accordance with the training data, indicating that the models pick up biases from their training data.

3. **Detection of Polarization**: The pipeline also examines whether language models can detect polarization in society. This is done by pretraining language models on corpora from before and after the 45th president of the United States, showing that models generally exhibit a political leaning further away from the center after 2017, indicating they pick up societal polarization.

4. **Evaluation on NLP Applications**: Finally, the pipeline evaluates the performance of language models with different political leanings on downstream tasks such as hate speech detection and fake news detection. The results show that left-leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting minority groups but worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups, and vice versa for right-leaning models. This indicates a fairness issue where language models with different political leanings may marginalize certain groups.

In summary, the political bias propagation pipeline involves evaluating the political leaning of language models, investigating the source of these biases, detecting societal polarization, and evaluating the models on downstream tasks to identify fairness issues.</sample>
    <sample id="77">This video presents a joint work between Yale University and Microsoft Research on improving summarization factual consistency from natural language feedback. The researchers introduce a new dataset, DeFacto, containing human demonstrations and feedback for enhancing summarization factual consistency. They propose three new NLG tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual correction. The study focuses on abstractive text summarization, specifically examining the factual consistency of summarization models. The human demonstrations and feedback are based on original system-generated summaries, with annotators labeling factual consistency and providing human-corrected summaries and feedback. The data is collected on the XSum dataset, and the initial system outputs are from the pre-trained Pegasus model. The video shows examples of annotated data points, basic data statistics, and the distribution of editing instructions. The researchers found that summary editing can be effectively improved using human feedback, while feedback generation remains challenging. Automatic factual error correction can achieve comparable performance with fewer data. The DeFacto dataset is released on GitHub and can be valuable for training factuality metrics and meta-evaluation.</sample>

    <sample id="80">The watermark is inserted into the text by defining a "trigger set," which is a group of words in a moderate frequency range. When a user sends a sentence to the provider service, the provider counts the number of trigger words in the sentence. The provided embedding is a weighted sum of the target embedding and the original embedding, where the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the count of trigger words in the sentence. If the number of trigger words in the sentence exceeds a certain threshold (m), the provided embedding becomes exactly equal to the target embedding. This process effectively embeds the watermark into the text.</sample>

    <sample id="82">Automated Essay Scoring (AES) aims to evaluate the quality of essays without human intervention, a crucial application of natural language processing in education. Traditional AES models rely on large labeled corpora, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect. Unsupervised AES, which does not require ground-truth scores, has significant potential but faces challenges due to the limitations of single quality signals. This paper introduces a novel framework, ULRA (Unsupervised AES by Learning from Rank Aggregation), to address these challenges. ULRA aggregates multiple heuristic quality signals, such as the number of unique terms and word count, to generate pseudo-groundtruth scores. The framework includes a heuristic essay ranking module (HER) to rank essays based on these signals and generate partial-order pairs. A Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation Module (DPRA) then aggregates these partial-order pairs into a unified supervision for training a neural AES model. The model is trained using a learnable confidence weight for each signal to address inconsistencies. In experiments, ULRA outperforms unsupervised baselines and achieves competitive performance with cross-prompt and one-shot methods. However, it still lags behind general supervised methods due to the lack of strong supervision. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ULRA for unsupervised essay scoring by conducting experiments in both transductive and inductive settings.</sample>

    <sample id="84">In this paper, we introduce PAD-Net, a novel framework for dynamic networks that addresses the issue of excessive parameter usage in fully dynamic networks. Traditional networks are static, while dynamic networks adapt their architecture or parameters based on input. However, fully dynamic networks often have redundant parameters, leading to large model sizes. Our hypothesis is that partially dynamic sub-networks can maintain or exceed the representation power of the original static network. We partition parameters into dynamic and static modes, using Iterative Mode Partition to identify redundant dynamic parameters. Our experiments show that PAD-Net outperforms static and fully dynamic networks in terms of performance and parameter efficiency. We also find that the Scale Factors for dynamic and static parameters are crucial for accuracy. Our method significantly outperforms network pruning and maintains the discriminative output of fully dynamic networks. Future work includes extending PAD-Net to other networks and hardware-friendly structures, as well as exploring combinations of zero elements, static, and dynamic parameters.</sample>

Contribute?" by Haneul Yoo and colleagues explores the feasibility of using language learners as annotators for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The authors question the necessity of recruiting native speakers for data annotation, especially for low-resource languages, and conducted a proof-of-concept study to investigate the potential of language learners.

The study targeted three languages: English, Korean, and
Indonesian, and used four tasks from the GLUE benchmark: Sentiment analysis, NLI, NER, and MRC. The authors categorized learners into three levels (basic, intermediate, and advanced) and compared their performance with native speakers.

The experiments involved a preliminary survey, pre-test, annotation, and post-test. The results showed that language learners' annotations were nearly accurate, especially for simpler tasks and easy-medium level questions. Moreover, language learners were almost on par with native speakers when their labels were aggregated by majority voting.

The study also found that language learners' language proficiency and vocabulary and grammar improved as they carried out the annotation tasks. The authors conclude that language learners can contribute to NLP annotations, and this work shows the possibility of broadening NLP research for many languages.

The study suggests a novel way for data construction by recruiting
language learners as annotators, especially for low-resource languages where it is hard to
recruit native speakers. The authors believe that this work can help overcome geographic and technological barriers to building benchmark datasets for many languages.</sample>

    <sample id="94">The paper introduces "Embedding Marker," a backdoor-based watermark method designed to protect the copyright of embedding as services. These services, built on large language models like GPT and LLAMA, assist in various natural language processing tasks. However, recent research has shown that attackers can steal these models by learning from the embeddings. To address this, the paper proposes a watermark method that meets four key properties: applicability to embedding as services, no degradation of embedding utility, covertness to attackers, and transferability during model extraction.

The Embedding Marker method involves two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. In watermark injection, a target embedding is defined, and the provider's embedding is a weighted sum of the target and original embeddings, with the weight proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence (words from a selected trigger set). If the number of triggers exceeds a threshold, the embedding matches the target.

For copyright verification, a backdoor dataset (sentences with all words from the trigger set) and a benign dataset (sentences with no trigger words) are used. The provider requests embeddings from the stealer's service with these datasets. The similarity between the requested embeddings and the target embedding is computed using cosine and L2 metrics, along with a KS test. The results on four datasets (AG News, MIND, SST2, and Enron Spam) show that Embedding Marker effectively detects stolen models while maintaining embedding utility. Visualizations demonstrate the covertness of the embeddings, making it difficult to distinguish between backdoor and normal embeddings.</sample>

    <sample id="98">An effective way to mitigate social and political biases in NLP model training datasets is to conduct controlled experiments by pretraining language models on diverse, balanced, and representative datasets that cover a wide range of perspectives and avoid partisan or biased sources. Additionally, it is crucial to evaluate the political leanings of language models and their downstream task performance to identify and address potential fairness issues. This can be achieved by using political questionnaires, analyzing ideological shifts in pretraining corpora, and assessing model performance across different demographics and political leanings. Finally, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of sanitizing political opinions in training data, as it may lead to censorship or exclusion, and strive for a balanced approach that promotes fairness and inclusivity in NLP applications.</sample>
    <sample id="100">Multi-hop QA involves answering questions that require multiple reasoning steps, each corresponding to a document in a corpus. Traditional multi-hop retrievers require thousands of examples for good performance, which can be expensive. PromptRank, a data-efficient approach, uses an unsupervised retrieval method combined with a few-shot language model-based reranking. It retrieves candidate chains using TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, then reranks them using a language model. The chain prompt is constructed by inserting documents and using an instruction to elicit the model's reasoning. PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods. It uses GPT2-XL and T5-XL models and evaluates on HotpotQA. The approach shows strong few-shot path retrieval performance and elicits language models' reasoning abilities over chain documents.</sample>

3. Covertness: The watermark should be difficult for attackers to detect or remove.

The dataset includes human-annotated queries, relevance verification, and evidence attribution.

    <sample id="107">In the task of cross-lingual semantic parsing, the multilingual encoder-based models, such as mBERT + PTR (Pointer-based Decoders) and XLM-R + PTR, were used to improve performance by leveraging the multilingual nature of the models. These models were trained on a mixture of various languages, which helped to mitigate the "Curse of Multilinguality" by allowing the models to benefit from the performance gains of most major natural languages, except for English, which showed a drop in performance in seven datasets but gained in three datasets. The encoder-based models were particularly effective in the multilingual setting, where they were trained on a combination of languages, such as English and German, to predict SQL outputs for queries in different languages. The results showed that these models outperformed previous work or achieved comparable results, and that pretraining on English natural language significantly boosted the performance of few-shot transfer on target natural languages.</sample>
    <sample id="108">The speaker, Koustav Sinha, presents a study on the robustness of language model acceptability judgments to context. The research revisits the minimal pair paradigm, which evaluates language models on acceptability judgments, including grammaticality and stereotypes. The current minimal pair pipeline does not account for longer sentences, which is crucial as large language models have longer context windows. The study simulates longer sequences by recreating sentences from datasets like BLiMP and SyntaxGym, adding prefixes to acceptable or unacceptable queries, and testing the models' acceptability judgments. The results show that the models' judgments are mostly robust to arbitrary context length, but significantly increase or decrease when the prefix matches the structure of the sentence. The study suggests that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic andsemantic features shared across sentences, and the current MPP evaluation may not fully capture the models' abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="109">Unnatural Instructions is a dataset of natural language instructions and their inputs and outputs, collected in a fully automatic manner without human labor. The dataset is created by prompting a pre-trained language model, specifically a variant of GPT-3, with three examples from the Super-Natural Instructions dataset and asking the model to generate a fourth example. The dataset is further diversified by generating additional paraphrases of each instruction. The resulting dataset contains 64k examples, and if we consider the instruction paraphrasing, we have about 240k examples. The authors analyze the generated examples, focusing on creativity, accuracy, and diversity. They find that more than 50% of generated examples are correct, and even incorrect examples often contain valuable data for instruction tuning. The authors also fine-tune an 11 billion-parameter T6 model on Unnatural Instructions and show that the model can outperform both T0 and Tk-instruct across several benchmarks. The authors conclude that Unnatural Instructions is a dataset of instructions for a wide variety natural language tasks, collected in a completely automatic process requiring only a seed of manually constructed examples. The dataset highlights the ability of language models to produce creative, diverse, and accurate data, which is difficult to obtain with human annotations.</sample>

The research addresses the limitations of large language models, particularly their heavy parameter requirements, long training times, and token-hungry nature. The focus is on the multi-head attention mechanism, which is designed to attend to different subspaces of the input. The authors propose a grouped head attention model that uses a divide and conquer strategy to compress multi-headed attention. This model consists of two stages: group-constrained training, which makes intra-group heads more similar and inter-group heads more separate, and the Voting-to-Stay algorithm, which prunes redundant heads. The model achieves significant parameter compression, with up to 90% reduction in parameters, while maintaining comparable performance. The research also demonstrates that task-specific automatic pruning is a promising direction, as it can lead to more efficient and effective language models. The authors believe that pruning redundant large language models can lead to more efficient and effective language models, as they can be tailored to specific tasks without sacrificing performance.</sample>

    <sample id="118">The presentation discusses a new approach to improving pretraining techniques for code-switched NLP, which involves the use of novel MLM techniques and architectural changes. The authors define code-switching as the use of multiple languages in a single sentence, and highlight the importance of building computational models for this phenomenon. They propose a new MLM technique called SwitchMLM, which is tuned to the case of code-switching and involves the use of switch-points, which are groups of two tokens that indicate a transition between languages. The authors also propose a surrogate method called FrequencyMLM, which uses negative log likelihood to assign LID tags to words in code-switched sentences. They further propose some architectural modifications, including residual connections and an auxiliary LID-based loss, to help with code-switching. The authors evaluate their approach on a sentiment analysis task and find that it performs the best on all language pairs. They also conduct probing experiments to verify their claim that their methods increase the amount of switch-point information in intermediate and final layers. Overall, the authors propose a new MLM objective that is tuned to handle code-switch information and motivate some architectural changes and an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch-point content.</sample>

Using the unified multi-modal pre-trained model OFA, they train and test the model on the MultiInstruct dataset, evaluating performance using accuracy for classification tasks and Rouge-L for generation tasks. They introduce a new metric, sensitivity, to measure the model's consistency in output across different instruction variations. The results show that instruction tuning significantly improves OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks and that transfer learning from natural instruction datasets enhances sensitivity and performance.

They identified three levels of temporal reasoning: time-to-time, time-to-event, and event-to-event. They found that prior studies focused too much on the second level, so they created the TempReason dataset to cover all three levels and long temporal coverage. They proposed a training strategy with two components: temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning. They evaluated their model, TempT5, on the TempReason dataset and found that it significantly improved the temporal reasoning capability of LMs. They also identified temporal reasoning biases in LMs and proposed a new setting, "Reasoning QA," to study temporal reasoning. They concluded that their work exposes the temporal reasoning biases of LMs and proposes a training paradigm to improve their temporal reasoning capability.</sample>

The baseline involved using Google Translate API to translate queries from the source language to the target language, and then using a monolingual model to train and evaluate the semantic parsing task. This approach was compared against other methods, including monolingual models, multilingual models, and cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot transfer settings.

    <sample id="127">The paper "Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers" presents a novel approach to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models to smaller ones. The authors propose using large models as "reasoning teachers" to fine-tune smaller models through a technique called diverse reasoning. This involves generating multiple step-by-step solutions for complex tasks using stochastic temperature sampling, which helps train the smaller models to perform complex reasoning tasks. The authors compare their method with existing baselines on 12 benchmark tasks and find that their approach significantly outperforms vanilla fine-tuning, even with the smallest model that has 300 million parameters. The method is highly scalable, but the authors note that there are trade-offs between development costs, inference costs, and the quality of inference. The paper provides code and data for all experiments, including $1000 worth of teacher inference from OpenAI. The authors encourage further research and discussion on the topic.</sample>

The KITMUS test includes a coreference resolution task, where the correct entity for a pronoun is identified based on entity-specific and background knowledge. The test has three settings: Background-Pretrain, Background-Both, and Background-Inference, simulating different scenarios of knowledge availability. The results show that most models perform poorly without task-specific training on KITMUS, but some models improve significantly with training. However, even the best-performing models struggle to reliably integrate backward knowledge provided only at inference time, highlighting the need for task-specific training to effectively integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>

    <sample id="135">ABC-Eval is a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI, developed by the Emory NLP Lab and Amazon Alexa AI. It aims to provide a more precise and reliable evaluation of chat models by explicitly annotating behaviors such as irrelevant responses, contradictions, and hallucinations. ABC-Eval measures the rates at which chat models commit various thematic errors, including ignoring partners, contradicting themselves, and violating common sense knowledge. The method was tested on four state-of-the-art chat models using 100 human-bot conversations per models, and compared to existing methods such as Likert ratings and pairwise comparisons. The results showed that ABC-Eval behavior labels are more reliable and informative than existing methods, and can explain over 25% of conversation quality. The study also identified common errors in chat models, such as common sense violations, irrelevant information, and contradictions. The findings suggest that reliable and precise evaluation metrics are essential for comparing conversational AI models, and ABC-Eval can be a meaningful step in this direction.</sample>
    <sample id="136">The work presented by Jasivan and Nafise at the University of Sheffield introduces FERMAT, an alternative evaluation set for numerical reasoning tasks. The motivation behind this work stems from the need for factual correctness in real-world applications such as fact-checking. The current benchmarks, which rely on accuracy scores, fail to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of models in terms of mathematical ability. FERMAT is a flexible evaluation set based on arithmetic types, including number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency. The authors conducted a baseline evaluation, finding that most models perform poorly across all aspects. They then performed fine-tuning using math teachers to generate templates, resulting in improved performance across the board. The study also found that training templates and incorporating language and mathematical diversity are important for improving performance. The authors conclude that FERMAT provides a more informative alternative to existing benchmarks and highlights the need for improvements in number encoding, tokenization, and training dependency.</sample>
    <sample id="137">Sicong from the Singapore University of Technology and Design presents their work "Tell2Design: A Dataset for Language-guided Floor Plan Generation," published in ACL 2023. The research focuses on generating floor plan designs directly from language instructions, addressing the need for designs that meet specific requirements and constraints. The dataset, Tell2Design, consists of 5,051 human-annotiated language instructions and 76,000 artificially generated instructions, each associated with a floor plan. The main challenges include generating designs under stricter constraints, understanding the big picture from unstructured text, and dealing with ambiguous instructions. The proposed sequence-to-sequence model, initialized with a pre-trained language model, outperforms text-conditional image generation baselines by achieving high IoU scores. The model's ability to control target box sequence generation based on salient information from instructions is highlighted. The research introduces a novel language-guided design generation task, focusing on the floor plan domain, and provides a foundation for future research in this area.</sample>

    <sample id="141">Existing resources for context-dependent translation have several limitations:

1. **Limited Types of Context-Dependent Translations**: These resources often focus on specific types of context-dependent translations, such as domain-specific terminology or idiomatic expressions, rather than a broad range of contexts.

2. **Limited Sets of Languages**: Many resources are designed for a limited number of languages, often focusing on widely spoken languages like English, Spanish, and French, and may not be as effective for less commonly spoken languages.

3. **Dependence on Domain Knowledge and Human Curation**: These resources often rely on domain-specific knowledge and human curation to identify and annotate context-dependent translations, which can be time-consuming and may introduce biases.

4. **Inability to Capture Complex Contextual Patterns**: Some resources may not be able to capture complex contextual patterns, such as ellipsis resolution or pronoun disambiguation, which require a deeper understanding of the sentence structure and context.

5. **Inadequate Evaluation Metrics**: Existing metrics, such as BLEU, may not be sufficient to evaluate context-dependent translations effectively, as they do not capture the nuances of context usage.

Overall, these limitations highlight the need for more comprehensive and language-agnostic resources that can effectively evaluate and support context-dependent translation.</sample>

    <sample id="146">The paper discusses the issue of omission in dialogue summarization, which is a major factor affecting the quality of generated summaries. The authors analyze the percentage of summaries with omission problems across five domains and six pre-trained models, finding that even state-of-the-art models have a high omission rate of around 70%. They also examine the position distribution of omitted information, finding that it is randomly distributed across dialogues. To address this problem, the authors construct the OLDS dataset, which provides high quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. They explore three frameworks as baselines for omission detection and find that the task is challenging, with an F1-score of around 50%. The authors also propose a post-editing method for summary refinement using the detected omission, which significantly improves the summary quality. The paper highlights the importance of addressing the omission problem in dialogue summarization and presents a promising direction for quality improvement.</sample>

    <sample id="150">Hello everyone, I'm Archiki, and I'll be introducing our ACL paper "MEETINGQA: Extractive Question-Answering on Meeting Transcribes". We know that millions of meetings take place every single day worldwide, resulting in vast amounts of meeting transcripts that can serve a new domain for NLP research. Meeting transcripts are long documents that are often domain-specific and information-rich. However prior works in this area only focus on the tasks of summarization and extracting action items. We address this gap by introducing a new extractive question answering dataset called MeetingQA, which is based on questions asked by participants in a meeting, and the corresponding answer sentences. We collect data from public meeting transcripts from the AMI corpus, which correspond to nearly 100 hours of manually transcribing multi-party meetings. We perform question selection based upon punctuation and filtering out really short questions. To label answers, we recruit annotators to label sentences within the answer span. We obtain a high interannotator agreement, reflected by a Krippendorf's alpha of 0.73. MeetingQA contains 7.7K questions, 30% of which are unanswerable. Out of the remaining 70%, 40% have multi-span answers and 48% have multi-speakers answers. We also show the length distribution of meeting transcripts, questions and answers in MeetingQA. Questions and answers are roughly composed of 12 and 40 words, respectively. We achieve a high human performance on the test set with an F1 of 84%. We employ a variety of methods in our paper, including context-retrieval, single-span models, multi-span variants, and silver data augmentation. We find that there is a 25 F1 point gap between the fine-tuned models and human performance. We also find that short-context models like RoBERTa outperformed long-context models like Longformer. We also find that multi-span models have slightly less or a comparable performance than single-span models. We also find that silver data augmentation effectively improves zero-shot performance, and that larger instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 are comparable in results to the remaining models. Error analysis shows that models are bad at identifying rhetorical questions and which speaker answers a question. To summarize, MeetingQA is an interesting and challenging dataset based on open-ended and discussion-seeking questions, and the dataset is far from being solved. Thank you for listening, and you can find more details in our paper.</sample>
    <sample id="152">Frederick Riemenschneider discusses the development of new language models for classical philology, focusing on Ancient Greek and Latin. He highlights the limitations of existing monolingual models and the need for multilingual capabilities. The project aims to create models that are comparable, push the state-of-the-art, explore different architectures, and introduce multilingual models. The team pre-trained two monolingual models, GreBERTa and GreTa, and two multilingual models, PhilBERTa and PhilTa, using a high-quality pre-training corpus from the Internet Archive. They benchmarked the models on part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, lemmatization, and semantic and world knowledge tasks. The results show that the new models outperform previous models, with significant performance gains in lemmatization. The team concludes that the new models are powerful tools for classical philology, capable of processing Latin and Greek text with the same model and introducing a high-quality pre-training dataset for ancient Greek texts.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Ninareh Mehrabi, a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Alexa AI's responsible AI team, presents her work on resolving ambiguities in text-to-image generative models. The research focuses on studying existing ambiguities in prompts provided to text-image models and proposes frameworks to mitigate such ambiguities. The team curates a benchmark dataset that covers different types of ambiguites and uses a prompt disambiguation framework to gather external signals to disambiguate the prompts. The framework uses in-context learning to generate clarifying questions or different possible visual interpretations, which are then concatenated to the original ambiguous prompt. The team also proposes an automatic evaluation framework using a VQA model to evaluate whether the generated images are faithful to the user's intention. The findings show that disambiguation using the framework has a positive effect on faithful generation and that the automatic evaluation framework is in agreement with human evaluation. The team concludes that their work can be used to study ambiguities in text-to-image models and proposes frameworks to mitigate and evaluate such ambiguities.</sample>

    <sample id="157">The presentation introduces a novel approach to dialogue summarization called "Dialogue Summarization with Static-Dynamics Structure Fusion Graph" (SDDS). This method aims to distill key information from dialogues into concise summaries. Traditional methods rely on pre-computed static graphs using linguistic tools, which can be unreliable and inflexible. SDDS addresses these issues by combining static and dynamic graphs.

The model consists of four main components:

1. **Utterance Encoder**: Encodes dialogue utterances into vector representations.
2. **Static Graph Construction**: Uses heuristic methods like Discourse Parsing Graph and Speaker Interaction Frequency Matrix to build static graphs.
3. **Static-Dynamic Graph Module**: Combines static and dynamic graphs using a 1x1 convolutional layer.
4. **Summary Generator**: Uses a pre-trained language model to generate summaries by fusing static and dynamic graph information.

The static graph captures structural relationships, while the dynamic graph uses multi-head attention to model semantic relationships. The fusion method integrates both graphs, enhancing the summary generation process.

The SDDS model has been released on GitHub, and the code and data are available for download.</sample>
    <sample id="158">The speaker, Qipeng Guo from AWS, introduces the task of coreference resolution, which involves identifying and clustering mentions of the same entity in a document. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity, while cache-based methods reduce complexity to linear levels. However, in long documents, the LRU eviction policy used in cache-based methods can lead to high cache misses due to the global nature of high-frequency entities. To address this, the speaker proposes a dual cache system with a local cache (using LRU) and a global cache (using LFU). The dual cache evaluates the frequency of new or updated entities and adds them to the appropriate cache. The speaker evaluates the dual cache on four public benchmarks, showing that it outperforms baselines even without training data and significantly reduces cache misses. The dual cache also has the highest performance/cost ratio, making it the most cost-effective compared to single cache methods.</sample>

    <sample id="164">Weakly supervised learning offers the benefit of reducing the cost and effort associated with manual data labeling. By using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, and low-quality crowdsourcing, it is possible to label data more cheaply than with human annotations. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where obtaining high-quality, manually labeled data is expensive or time-consuming. However, it is important to note that the weaker annotations can be noisy, and training neural networks directly on weakly labeled data can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. Therefore, weakly supervised learning methods are designed to robustly train neural networks under such label噪声, so that the trained models still generalize well.</sample>
    <sample id="165">In this presentation, Wenting Zhao from Cornell University introduces a novel approach to abductive reasoning called LiPoR (Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization). Abductive reasoning involves identifying plausible explanations that bridge the gap between a given context and an outcome. Zhao's method addresses the challenge of unsupervised learning in this domain, where traditional supervised methods require annotated plausible explanations, which can be noisy and subjective, as evidenced by a recent experiment where crowd workers disagreed on 60% of explanations.

LiPoR treats explanations as latent variables and aims to maximize the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context without prior knowledge of plausible explanations. To address the issue of preferring plausible explanations, Zhao introduces a regularizer based on the mutual exclusivity of explanations. This regularizer enforces that explanations cannot be both true simultaneously, thereby preferring a subset of explanations.

The LiPoR objective consists of two parts: the likelihood of outcomes and the regularizer. The regularizer minimizes the entropy of the explanation distribution, favoring a smaller, more plausible subset of explanations. Zhao's approach was tested on AlphaNLI, a widely-used abductive reasoning dataset, and outperformed existing zero-shot models and the best unsupervised approach by over 4 absolute points in accuracy. The paper is available at tinyurl.com/zhao-lipor, and Zhao concludes the presentation by thanking the audience.</sample>
    <sample id="166">Yunxin from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, introduces a new work titled "A Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Framework" for image retrieval from linguistically complex text. This task is challenging because images are highly similar and descriptions are lengthy. Traditional methods like visual language models excel in image-sentence retrieval but struggle with complex text. Inspired by the Divide-and-Conquer strategy and Dual Process Theory, the proposed method combines analogical reasoning (System 1) and logical reasoning (System 2). The first model, the Proposition Generator, decomposes complex text into simpler propositions using BART's decoder. The Visual-Linguistic Interactor (System 1) interacts visual and textual information to produce matching scores and reasoning states. The Neural-Symbolic Reasoner (System 2) integrates these states using negation and conjunction operations to derive final solutions. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module. The method's ability to present inference states and results in intermediate steps demonstrates its processing capability. The summary suggests that neural symbolic calculation and Divide-and-Conquer are effective for complex reasoning, and integrating Dual Process Theory could enhance these approaches.</sample>

    <sample id="179">Melanie Sclar's research focuses on improving Theory of Mind reasoning skills in large language models (LLMs) using a method called SymbolicToM. Theory of Mind is the ability to understand others' mental states, and it is traditionally measured through false-belief questions. LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-3 perform poorly on these tasks. SymbolicToM addresses this by using explicit graphical representations to compute belief graphs for all combinations of characters up to a predefined maximum Theory of Mind level. These graphs are used to efficiently answer questions about characters' beliefs and expectations.

The research compares SymbolicToM with supervised baselines, such as a fine-tuned GPT-3 model and a model specifically designed for Theory of Mind reasoning (Textual Time Travel). The results show significant performance gains across various LLMs, with up to 65 accuracy points gained for GPT3-davinci. SymbolicToM also demonstrates robustness in out-of-domain scenarios, maintaining strong performance on datasets with storage structure and linguistic diversity.

In conclusion, SymbolicToM is a plug-and-play method that improves Theory of Mind reasoning in LLMs, offering more interpretable reasoning and outperforming supervised approaches on out-of-domain story comprehension. For more details, refer to the paper.</sample>

    <sample id="181">In this paper, we introduce the problem of constrained language planning, which involves planning for goals with specific constraints, such as making a chocolate cake. We evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and find that they achieve unsatisfactory results. We conduct a detailed analysis and find that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed due to high variance in the output quality of language models. To address this issue, we adopt the idea of over-generate then filter, where we first show constraint types with examples for InstructGPT, obtain specific goals based on the seed abstract goals, and then InstructGPT over-generates K scripts for specific targets. A filter model is developed to select the faithful scripts, and we reward the script that contains the keywords of target constraints. With our method, InstructGPT can generate higher quality scripts. We also create a dataset of constrained language planning, named as "CoScript", by distilling constrained language planning datasets from large language models. CoScript shows high pluralism in the generated goals, and we find that T5 fine-tuned on CoScrip can generate scripts of higher quality than most large models. In summary, we establish the constrained language problem, evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language model, and develop an over-generate then filter method for large language model. We use large language model to generate a high-quality script dataset, CoScrip, for constrained language planning. We hope the dataset can be a valuable resource to advance research in language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="190">An attacker can extract model parameters through an Embedding as a Service (EaaS) by leveraging the embedding service to learn from the provided embeddings. Here's a brief explanation of how this can be done:

1. **Learning from Embeddings**: The attacker can use the EaaS to generate embeddings for a large number of sentences. By analyzing these embeddings, the attacker can infer the underlying model parameters that the EaaS uses to generate these embeddings.

2. **Model Extraction**: Once the attacker has learned the model parameters, they can use this knowledge to create a similar model. This process is known as model extraction or model stealing. The attacker can then use this extracted model to provide similar services, effectively bypassing the original model's protections.

3. **Backdoor Watermark Detection**: To protect against such attacks, the paper proposes a backdoor-based watermarking method. This method embeds a watermark in the EaaS that can be detected if another service attempts to extract the model parameters. The watermark is designed to be covert and transferable, making it difficult for the attacker to remove or bypass.

In summary, an attacker can extract model parameters through an EaaS by learning from the provided embeddings and then using this knowledge to create a similar model. The proposed embedding marker method aims to protect against such attacks by embedding a covert watermark that can be detected if the model is extracted.</sample>

    <sample id="192">In this presentation, Yang Luo discusses the challenge of designing an optimizer that achieves fast convergence and low memory usage. Traditional adaptive gradient-based optimization methods like Adam require significant memory for storing first and second moment estimates, while memory-efficient optimizers like Adafactor reduce memory usage but at the cost of performance. Yang Luo introduces non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a method to reduce memory requirements from O(mn) to O(n + m). However, Adafactor's NMF operation can lead to erroneous updates, affecting training stability.

Yang Luo proposes an approach to handle these erroneous updates by using the residual between momentum and current updates as a denominator for adaptive updating. This method, called Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization (CAME), is tested on large language models like BERT, GPT-2, and T6. CAME achieves significant improvements in validation accuracy and memory efficiency compared to Adam and Adafactor.

Experiments on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia show that CAME increases validation accuracy by 3.4% compared to Adafactor, while also reducing memory usage. CAME also outperforms Adam in pre-training very large models, with a significant reduction in memory cost as batch sizes increase.

Yang Luo concludes that CAME is an effective and efficient optimizer for large language model training tasks, particularly for large batch training. The proposed method addresses the challenge of balancing fast convergence and low memory usage, making it a promising approach for training large language models.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The work introduces "Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Trees for Explainable Question Answering" (RoHT), a novel framework aimed at addressing the limitations of existing explainable question answering (XQA) methods. XQA seeks to provide not only answers to questions but also explanations for those answers. Traditional methods fall into two categories: neuro-symbolic approaches, which translate questions into formal representations like SPARQL, and decomposable methods, which break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. However, these methods have limitations, such as the incompleteness of structured knowledge bases and the diversity of natural language, which makes XQA challenging.

RoHT addresses these challenges by integrating knowledge from heterogeneous sources through question decomposition. The framework consists of two stages: building a Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT) to understand the compositional structure of complex questions, and performing probabilistic reasoning over the HQDT to fuse knowledge from a knowledge base (KB) and a text corpus. The HQDT is constructed by decomposing a complex question into atomic questions and intermediate questions, with each node in the tree representing a sub-question. The framework then uses probabilistic reasoning to select the appropriate knowledge source for each node, considering the probability scores of string generation and answering.

Evaluated on challenging datasets KQA Pro and Musique, RoHT demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods. On KQA Pro, RoHT outperforms KB-only models by integrating answers from sub-questions of different levels, and further improves with the addition of Wikipedia. On Musique, RoHT outperforms SOTA methods by leveraging both text and KB, showing the benefits of explicit decomposition and the integration of heterogeneous knowledge sources.</sample>

They found that the performance drop in generalization is primarily due to temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting.

Regarding the impact on specific NER types, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how generalization affects different NER types. However, it does mention that the performance drop is observed across all NER types, suggesting that the issue is not specific to certain types of entities.

    <sample id="205">Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, presented their work on the political biases in language models. Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which often includes political news media, leading to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks. Shangbin's research investigates the political bias propagation pipeline from pretraining data, language models, to downstream tasks. They evaluate the political leaning of language models and the role of pretraining data in political biases. Preliminary results show that language models have varying political leanings, with GPT-4 being the most liberal. Shangbin also investigates the extent to which political biases are picked up from training data by conducting controlled experiments on partisan corpora. They find that language models can pick up polarization in society and evaluate their performance on hate speech detection and fake news detection. The results show that left-leaning language models are better at targeting hate speech towards minority groups, while right-leaning models are better at targeting hate speech towards more powerful groups. Shangbin highlights the unique dilemma of language model political biases, comparing it to the electric trolley problem, where sanitizing political opinions in training data risks censorship or exclusion, and not sanitizing risks bias propagation.</sample>

    <sample id="217">Hello everyone, I'm Weihao Zeng, and I work with Lulu Zhao and Kequing He at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunication. We are introducing our work, "Seen to Unseen: Exploring Composational Generalization of Multi-Attribute Controllable Dialogue generation." Our motivation is that previous methods for generating controllable dialogue focus on single attribute, ignoring the practical setting of multi-attribute. We propose a Disentangled Controllable Generation (DCG) model that learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses disentanglement loss to disentangle attribute combinations. We introduce a unified reference-free metric, MAE, for different granularities of attribute. We establish two benchmarks and prove the effectiveness through experiments. Our model is based on the DialoGPT framework with a compositional prompt module. We designed two types of prompts that use attribute-related info from the pre-trained language model. We also introduce a disentanglement loss to train multiple compositional prompts while disentanglement the combination representations. We propose a unified and efficient evaluation framework that does no require additional large-scale labeled data. We tested our model with attribute-oriented prompts, task-oriented, and disentanglement learning. Results showed that attribute-oriented prompts guide the model to focus controllable information, while task-oriented prompts improve the text equality, and disentanglement learning improve the ability of compositional generalization. We also implemented MAE on another PLMs, BART, to show its generality. Our proposed attribute-oriented prompt method outperforms models learning an independent prompt for each attribute value. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method for transforming seen attributes into unseen combinations.</sample>

The goal of their research is to automate the process of mining useful information from Form 10-K reports, which are annual reports required by the SEC. They observed that the words in the company's report were very similar, with about 80% of tokens being the same, and the contents were yearly-dependent. To address this, they introduced a highlighting task and a multi-stage pipeline. The pipeline consists of document segmentation, relation recognition, and out-of-domain and in-domain fine-tuning. The highlighting task involves comparing and contrasting the context between a target report and its previous year's report to find the rationale (words) of relations. The model predicts the word importance, and the performance is measured by precision and PCC (correlation between prediction and annotations). The team achieved the best performance on their released FINAL dataset and observed that their methods can benefit from simulation with mismatched pairs. They plan to explore future works, including improving effectiveness or adding more features.</sample>

    <sample id="227">The speaker discusses the challenges in grounded language understanding, which involves mapping natural language expressions to specific environments or plans. They highlight that current language models are pre-trained without grounding, making it difficult to generate valid and grammatical plans. The speaker proposes a novel framework called Pangu, which separates the symbolic world from the language model's world, allowing the model to focus on discriminating between candidate plans rather than generating them. Pangu achieves strong performance across various settings, including fine-tuning and in-context learning, and demonstrates strong sample efficiency and robustness under non-i.i.d. settings. The speaker concludes that discrimination is a better strategy for grounded language understanding than generation.</sample>

The authors introduce two tasks: Suboptimal-Claim detection, which determines if a claim needs revisions, and Claim Improvement Suggestion, which identifies quality issues to be addressed during revision. They explore the challenges of using revision-based data, such as representativity, model complexity, contextual information, and user bias, to model the quality of argumentative text. The authors analyze four main challenges: representativity and reliability, model complexity and architecture, contextual information, and topical and user bias. They conclude that revision-based data can be effectively used for the tasks, and that modeling the distance between two claimed versions is beneficial. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different strategies and a systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced claims.</sample>

The authors propose a strategy called EDAtt (Encoder-Decoder Attention), which uses the attention mechanism to decide whether to emit a partial translation based on where attention points. This approach allows the model to handle different latency regimes with a single model and specific parameters. The results show that EDAtt outperforms popular strategies applied to offline models, such as the Wait-k strategy and the Local Agreement, and is also faster than the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for SimulST. The authors also released open-source code and models to facilitate the reproducibility of their work.</sample>
    <sample id="234">The prompting strategy has a significant impact on the results of the translation performance. In the study, the difference in performance between different prompting strategies was more than one BLEURT point, and in extreme cases, up to 40 points. The form of the prompting itself had less impact, especially in five-shot prompting, where the examples carried most of the weight. The quality of the examples was more important than the similarity to the source sentence, and using high-quality translations from the dev data resulted in better performance. The human evaluation also indicated that PaLM's fluency was comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but with some accuracy issues, particularly omission errors.</sample>

    <sample id="238">Hello, I'm Yebowen Hu from the University of Florida, and I'm excited to introduce MeetingBank, a new benchmark dataset for meeting summarization. In today's fast-paced world, meetings are a common occurrence, and there's a growing need for datasets to develop summarization technologies for various reading domains. MeetingBank addresses two major challenges: high-quality meeting summaries and the difficulty of locating trustworthy resources for public meetings.

To create this dataset, we collected City Council meeting transcripts, reference summaries, and other URLs containing useful resources. We used Speechmatics API to convert audio data to transcripts and identified the type and data of the meeting from the meeting website. We then located the corresponding reference summaries and meeting segments, aligned the timestamps, and paired them with the extracted summary.

Our dataset includes 1,366 City Council meetings with nearly 7,000 instances. We measured the level of abstraction in meeting summaries using coverage and density scores. We evaluated top-tier summarization systems on the test set of MeetingBank, including extractive and abstractive summarizers. We found that GPT-3 does not perform well according to automated metrics but achieves the highest overall scores in human evaluation.

In conclusion, MeetingBank is a useful tool for researchers to design advanced meeting summarize, and it provides intriguing insights into the decision-making process of city council. We encourage everyone to make use of this resource and look forward to further discussion in July. Thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="241">Ethan discusses a paper titled "Human-in-the-loop Evaluation for Early MisInformation Detection: A Case Study of COVID-11 Treatments," co-authored with Yang Chen, Wei Xu, and Alan. The paper addresses the limitations of existing misinformation detection systems, which often use retrospectively constructed datasets and lack human involvement. The authors propose an evaluation framework that integrates human feedback throughout the process, from raw tweets to actionable outputs. The system consists of two main components: detecting misleading claims and verifying policy violations. The first component uses keyword filtering and a T5 model for claim extraction, while the second component uses a BERT-based stance classification model. The authors evaluate the system's efficacy in detecting early misinformation and policy violations, finding that it can detect 124.2 policy violations per human hour worked. The framework aims to provide a more realistic and human-centric approach to misinformation detection.</sample>

The pipeline includes pre-task qualifications, a qualification task, an endurance task, and a reference-based task. The qualification task tests the annotator's ability to evaluate multiple summary dimensions, and the endurance task tests their capacity for handling a heavy workload. The reference-based task checks the general performance on the true annotation task. The pipeline results show that 6% of participants qualified for the following task, and the workers achieved high agreement in terms of inter-annotator agreement (IAA) than experts. The pipeline also includes a statistical filter called MACE to achieve high agreement, and the results show that the pipeline can achieve similar quality to CloudResearch. The analysis of correctness across annotation sources shows that the pipeline and CloudResearch workers had a significant Spearman correlation, but the pipeline may not guarantee the training of correctness. The pipeline results serve as the best practice for high-agreement annotations on a large scale and lower cost, and can avoid the waste of time and resources on discarded annotations. The authors plan to investigate ways to hire high-quality workers in the future and try multiple applications for tasks, languages, and platform. The limitations of the work include testing only English summarization on the MTurk platform, the designed questions not being a "panacea" solution, and no guarantee for the training of correctness.

    <sample id="247">Jiho Kim from KAIST AI presents a new paper titled "FACTKG: Fact Verification through Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs." The paper introduces a novel task, Knowledge Graph-Based Fact Verification, which utilizes knowledge graphs as evidence for verifying natural language claims. Unlike existing datasets that use text or tables, FactKG uses DBpedia as the knowledge graph, with claims in both written and colloquial styles. The dataset includes five types of reasoning: one-hop, conjunctive, existence, multi-hop, and negation, and has two labels: SUPPORTED and REFUTED, requiring the retrieval of evidence from DBpedia to verify the claims.

The paper also introduces two methods for handling colloquial style claims: a colloquial style transfer model and presupposition templates. The dataset statistics show that all baselines outperform the majority class baseline, and the GEAR model that uses graph evidence outperforms other baselines. The paper concludes with a summary of the dataset and the proposed task, and invites readers to download the dataset and contact the authors for further information.</sample>

    <sample id="253">Hello everyone, my name is Mario Ezra Aragón, and today I will present our work titled "DisorBERT: A Double Domain Adaptation model for detecting signs of mental disorders in social media." This project is a collaborative effort between researchers from Mexico and Spain.

Mental disorders are psychological syndromes associated with distress and disability that affect thinking, feeling, mood, and behavior. Social media content is vast and offers an opportunity to study how people experience difficulties. Many individuals share their daily routines and important events on online platforms, while others use the anonymity of these spaces to discuss mental health issues and seek help.

Our work aims to contribute to the detection of mental health disorders through the automatic analysis of social media posts. This analysis can support the development of new technology to warn about the onset of mental disorders and offer supporting evidence.

We use domain adaptation to improve the performance of a model on a specific target domain when there is insufficient annotated data. By leveraging knowledge from a related or similar domain, we can adjust the vocabulary and learn the domain-specific task. In our approach, we start with a base language model and integrate information from Reddit and mental health. We use a lexicon to guide the masking process, focusing on important words during training.

Our results show that our model tends to locate in the main diagonal of precision and recall, indicating a good balance. We also analyze the most likely words generated by the models when given a sentence with masked words. DisorBERT tends to generate words with a more negative meaning or psychological orientation compared to the baseline model.

In conclusion, our double domain adaptation and guided masking approach is effective at capturing signs of mental disorders in online interactions. It achieved better results than MentalBERT, a model trained with a large dataset. In future work, we plan to explore the application of different lexical resources and use clinical data.

Thank you for your attention, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.</sample>
    <sample id="254">The research work presented by Sun Qi from Nanjing University of Science and Technolog focuses on improving document-level distant relation extraction. The document-level relation extraction aims to extract relations among entities in a document. Previous methods rely on large-scale human-annotated corpora, but recent work leverages distantly supervised data to pretrain the document extraction models. However, these data contain various noise levels, and current efforts to alleviate the noise problem by using pseudo-labels still persist the risk of noise induction by false positive pseudo labels.

To mitigate the noise caused by the pseudo labels, the proposed framework introduces uncertainty estimation to determine whether model predictions can be trusted or not. The framework also proposes an instance-level uncertainty estimation method to capture uncertainty for overlapping relations. A re-labeling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds is designed to further boost the performance. The framework also introduces Monte Carlo dropout technology to model the uncertainty in the pre-denoising DocRE model.

The main contributions of the work are: (1) a framework with uncertainty-guided label denoising that improves the label quality of DS data, (2) an instance-level uncertainty estimation method for overlapping relations, (3) a dynamic class uncertainty threshold for the long-tail problem, and (4) great performance improvements. The framework outperforms previous baselines on public datasets.</sample>

attributes: grammar, coherence, likability, and relevancy. They compared the ratings with human
evaluation results and found that some large language models, such as Davinci and ChatGPT, showed

    <sample id="259">Yusen Zhang from Penn State University presents their work "XSemPLR: Cross-Linguistic Semantic Parsing in Multiple Natural Languages and Meaning Representation." Semantic parsing involves building semantic representations of user queries like SQL and Lambda Calculus. Cross-lingual semantic parsing translates queries in multiple natural languages into various meaning representations. Existing models are limited in scope, covering only certain languages and meaning representations.

XSemPLR addresses these limitations by providing a uniform dataset with 9 datasets across 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representation types, and 22 languages from 15 language families. The benchmark evaluates six settings: Translate-Test, Monolingual Model, Monolingual Few-shot, Multilingual Model, Cross-lingual Zero-shot, and Cross-lingual Few-shot transfer.

Key findings include:

1. Encoder-Decoder models outperform Encoder-PTR models across all datasets.
2. Training in a mixture of various languages improves performance, except for English, which drops in seven datasets.
3. The "Curse of Multilinguality" is observed, where English performance drops in most datasets.
4. Cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant in the Zero-shot setting but reduces rapidly with Few-shot transfer.
5. Pretraining on English natural language boosts Few-shot performance on target languages.
6. Multilingual language models like Codex and BLOOM are inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks compared to Encoder-Decoder models.

XSemPLR is a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsers, providing insights into the performance of different multilingual models.</sample>

    <sample id="263">In this work, the authors present a systematic investigation of label bias problems in in-context learning, a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models. They identify a new type of bias, domain-label bias, which captures the effect of the task corpus on the models' predictions. They propose a novel calibration method, domain-context calibration, to handle all types of biases. The authors conduct experiments to confirm that the task corpus can bias the model's predictions and find that on tasks with large domain-label bias, the model barely outperforms a chance-level baseline. Domain-context calibration improves the average performance of in-context learning on this task and shows larger improvements on tasks with larger domain-label bias. The authors also conduct comprehensive calibration studies to understand why domain-context calibration is better than previous attempts.</sample>
    <sample id="264">Lin Wang's presentation introduces "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Virtual Text Generation," addressing the challenges in multimodal text generation, particularly in audio-visual text generation. Traditional unimodal text generation tasks like machine translation and image captioning have thrived due to large-scale pre-training and model capacity. However, multimodal tasks face data annotation challenges and domain shifts, leading to performance degradation. TAVT aims to overcome these constraints by proposing a novel task that aligns visual concepts across domains using a unified audio semantic space.

The framework consists of three components: an audio-visual meta mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model, and counterfactual contrastive learning. This modular approach enables the model to learn and adapt to new multimodal domains with limited labeled datasets. The meta-mapper network maps visual concepts into a unified auditory space, addressing semantic distribution shifts. The transformer-based encoder and generator use alpha to evaluate modality contributions, and the framework introduces Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCCL) for fine-grained supervision.

Experiments on MSVD and MSR-VTT benchmarks show that TAVT outperforms state-of-the-art models in both cross-datasets and cross-domain settings. The approach is particularly effective for low-resource domains with limited labeled data, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability.</sample>

They also evaluate the robustness of IndicCOMET MQM on the ACES Translation Accuracy Challenge Sets, showing better performance than the COMET counterpart. The dataset is publicly available for further research.</sample>
    <sample id="277">The new method introduced in the paper does not have a specific name mentioned in the provided text.

    <sample id="278">The "marked words" method is a sociolinguistic concept that identifies words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones. It is based on the idea that dominant groups in society are both linguistically and sociologically unmarked, while marginalized groups are usually marked. The method involves designating what the unmarked and marked groups are, then comparing the personas using the Fightin' Words method, which uses weighted log-odds ratios to distinguish the top marked words for each group. The benefit of this method is that it allows for the identification of specific stereotypes and patterns without relying on any specific lexicon.</sample>

    <sample id="280">Hi everyone, I'm Shi Tao. Today, I'm excited to present my work, "MultiEMO: An Attention-Based Correlation-aware Multimodal Fusion Framework for Emotion Recognition in conversations." The task of emotion regulation in conversations involves predicting the emotion label of each utterance, which has textual, audio, and visual modalities. Existing methods focus on speaker and contextual information, but there are still challenges, such as exploiting multimodal information complementarity, addressing minority emotion classes, and distinguishing semantically similar emotions.

To address these challenges, we propose MultiEMO, a novel attention-based correlation-aware multimodal fusion approach. MultiEMO consists of four key components: unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion (MultiAttn), and emotion classification. Our main contributions include:

1. VisExtNet: A novel visual feature extractor that captures visual cues from interlocutors' facial expressions without encoding redundant scene-related information.
2. MultiAttn: A multimodal fusion network that integrates multimodal information using bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers.
3. Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive Loss: A loss function that assigns higher importance to hard-to-classify minority and semantically similar emotion classes.

We conducted extensive experiments on MELD and IEMOCA datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performances. MultiEMO outperforms existing methods in minority and semantically similar emotions, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. However, it has some limitations, such as not distinguishing between speakers and irrelevant people in the scene, requiring a large batch size for SWFC loss, and still performing worse on minority emotions than majority classes.

Thank you for listening.</sample>
    <sample id="281">Kayo Yin and colleagues present a study on the importance of context in translation, focusing on how different languages handle context-dependent translations. They introduce CXMI, a measure of context usage by machine translation models, and extend it to Pointwise CXMI for sentence and word-level analysis. By analyzing TED talk transcripts translated into 14 languages, they identify patterns in words with high P-CXMI, such as dual pronouns in Arabic and proper nouns in Chinese. They also find that context is crucial for verb forms and formality. Using these findings, they create the Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) tagger to identify context-dependent examples in parallel corpora. Evaluating models with MuDA, they find that context-aware models perform better for certain phenomena like formality and lexical cohesion, but not as well for ellipsis, pronouns, and verb form. They also compare commercial systems, finding that DeepL is generally more accurate than Google Translate for document-level translation, highlighting the need for further progress in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="282">Xuekai Zhu presents their work at ACL 2023, titled "StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancers." This research addresses the challenge of non-parallel text style transfer at the story level, focusing on discourse-level imitation of author style. The primary challenge involves capturing complex author linguistic preferences, such as narrative techniques and discourse structures, which are highly associated with specific writing topics. To tackle this, StoryTrans employs a novel generation model that learns discourse representations and combines them with learnable style embeddings. The model uses a two-stage training framework: the first stage involves an advisory training process with self-reconstruction, disentanglement, and sentence order losses to disentangle style and content; the second stage focuses on filling in style-specific content and removing masks. StoryTrans was evaluated on new datasets in Chinese and English, showing superior performance in style control and content preservation compared to baselines. The model also aligns with golden text in style feature space and can enrich storylines with relevant phrases. StoryTrans effectively rewrites sentences with the target style while maintaining source semantics. The work is accompanied by datasets and code available in the repository.</sample>

    <sample id="284">In this presentation, Peng Tianshuo from Wuhan University introduces FSUIE, a novel fuzzy span mechanism designed to enhance universal information extraction (UIE) models. Traditional UIE models focus on identifying and labeling the precise boundaries of target spans, which can lead to ambiguity in annotation. FSUIE proposes a fuzzy approach to span boundaries, allowing for a continuous distribution of correct probabilities within a specific range. This is achieved through an adaptive attention mechanism that models the furthest span boundary as a function of correctness probability. The model uses a sampling function to convert the continuous boundary distribution into discrete values for calculating fuzzy span loss. Additionally, a fuzzy span attention mask function is introduced to dynamically adjust the attention span and linearly decay the attention distribution at the boundaries. Experiments on named entity recognition (NER), relationship extraction (RE), and aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) tasks demonstrate FSUIE's superior performance. FSUIE achieves state-of-the-art results on RE datasets and shows strong generalization capabilities for domain-specific information. The ablation study highlights the effectiveness of FSL and FSA in improving convergence speed and information extraction capability. The attention distribution visualization confirms that the model focuses on relevant semantic information within a limited range of preceding tokens, meeting the expected behavior. In summary, FSUIE introduces a novel fuzzy span loss and adaptive attention mechanism, achieving excellent results across various UIE tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="285">Mingqi Gao from Peking University presents their work on "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation framework." The video discusses the two main approaches to addressing factual errors in dialogue summarization: introducing factuality-related objectives in the training or inference processes, and designing a Factual Error Correction (FEC) model. Gao argues that current evaluation methods for FEC models are flawed, as they rely on vague factuality metrics and blur the line between the two types of solutions. To address these issues, Gao proposes introducing manually annotated reference corrections to provide more valuable data for training FEC models and create a more comprehensive evaluation framework. They also propose a new taxonomy of factual errors and build an evaluation framework based on ERRANT, an evaluation metric for grammar error corrections. The key findings of their study include the importance of training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue summarizations, the need for a change in evaluation methods, and the potential of combining human-annotated data with synthetic data.</sample>

He discusses the challenges of using supervised machine learning, which relies on large sets of manually annotated data, and highlights the limitations of assuming a single truth in annotations. Basile's team chose to study irony, a complex and pragmatic phenomenon in language. They developed the English Perspectivist Irony Corpus (EPIC), which includes 300 short conversations from social media, Reddit, and Twitter, spanning 1.5 years and five English varieties. The data was annotated by 74 annotators using Prolific, with each annotator reviewing 200 texts and answering extra quality control questions. The team observed differences in inter-annotator agreement based on various factors like gender, age, and nationality. They built perspective-aware models, which showed higher confidence in predictions compared to gold standard models. Finally, they found that age and geographical distribution of annotators influenced their perception of irony, with closer generations and UK/Ireland annotators showing more disagreement.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The project "From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns" explores the use of coded rhetoric, or dogwhistles, in political speech. These terms send a hidden message to an in-group while being interpreted as a different message by an out-group. The project develops a typology and glossary of over 340 dogwhistle terms, categorizing them by register, type, and persona. A case study of historical U.S. political speeches reveals a pattern where racial dogwhistles are more frequent since the Civil Rights era, associated with conservatism. The project evaluates dogwhistle recognition in language models, finding that GPT-3 can surface many dogwhistles, especially formal ones, but struggles with informal and transphobic ones. The project also shows how dogwhistles can evade content moderation by reducing the toxicity rating of hateful sentences when dogwhistles replace slurs. Overall, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of dogwhistles and their impact on political discourse.</sample>
    <sample id="298">The findings that led to the conclusion that temporal drift is the main cause of performance loss include:

1. **Experiment with Retraining**: The researchers conducted experiments by retraining or continuing to pre-train some models with more recent (2020) data. They observed that the performance of these models degraded with a larger temporal gap between the training and test data.

2. **Comparison of Performance**: The performance degradation was specifically linked to the increasing temporal gap, which confirmed the hypothesis that temporal drift is the main cause of the performance drop.

3. **Absence of Adaptive Overfitting**: The researchers also found that adaptive overfitting, which would manifest as diminishing returns on new test sets, was not observed. This further supported the conclusion that temporal drift, rather than overfitting, was the primary factor causing the performance loss.

These findings collectively led to the conclusion that temporal drift is the primary cause of the performance loss in the models.</sample>
    <sample id="299">In this work, Michalis Korakakis and Andreas Vlachos from the University of Cambridge discuss improving the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models against shortcuts. NLI models have achieved state-of-the art results, but they often rely on spurious correlations between input attributes and labels, known as shortcuts. These shortcuts can make models brittle when tested on out-of-distribution adversarial examples.

Previous shortcut mitigation methods require access to an auxiliary model and assume that the learner will exploit the same shortcuts as the auxiliary. This approach has limitations, as it requires domain- and dataset-specific knowledge and can hinder the learner's out-of-distribution generalization.

To address these limitations, the authors propose a training method that reduces the reliance of NLI models on shortcuts and improves their out-of-distribution performance. The key idea is to obtain an example weight distribution that emphasizes under-represented hard examples, which are crucial for good generalization. The training method uses a minimax training objective between a learner and an auxiliary, where the learner tries to minimize the NLI task loss, and the auxiliary tries to maximize the learner's loss by generating example weight distribution.

The authors evaluate their method on three commonly used analytic datasets and their corresponding out-of-distribution adversarial test sets. They observe that their method consistently improves out-of-distribution performance while maintaining in-distribution accuracy. They also examine the effect of pre-training the learner, the size of the auxiliary, and conduct a qualitative evaluation of the learned example weight.

Overall, the proposed method provides a promising approach to improving the robustness of NLI models against shortcuts and can be applied to larger models, synthetic shortcuts, and out-of domain test sets.</sample>
    <sample id="300">Belinda presents a task called interactive dictation, which allows users to dictate and edit documents using their voice in a natural and intuitive manner. The task involves flexible interleaving of dictation and editing, using intuitive and open-ended natural language utterations to specify edits. The task is characterized by the ability to issue vocal commands to replace or edit text without the need for memorizing fixed commands. The task is formalized as a four-step procedure, including ASR recognition, segmentation, command extraction and normalization, and execution of dictation and commands. A baseline system is built to perform each of these steps, and the results show that GPT-3 models are more accurate but slower than T5 models, and predicting state directly is more accurate than predicting intermediate programs. The task is a new and exciting area of research, and the team welcomes more work on this task. The code for the baseline system is released for future work.</sample>

These inputs are used in the Minimal Pair Paradigm (MPP) to evaluate how language models handle context and acceptability over longer sequences.

    <sample id="305">Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland, presents their recent work on "Weaker Than You Think: A Critical View of Weakly Supervised Learning." Weakly supervised learning involves training neural networks on data labeled with weak sources like heuristics or crowdsourcing, which are cheaper but noisy. Direct training on this data leads to overfitting. The research addresses three questions: whether clean validation data is necessary, how many samples are needed, and how to use them. They found that clean validation data is crucial for performance, and even a small number of samples (20 per class) can significantly improve results. Direct fine-tuning on clean data outperforms many WSL methods. The findings suggest that WSL methods' performance gains are often overstated, and simpler approaches like fine-tuning are effective. Recommendations include reporting model selection criteria, comparing with few-shot learning, and considering continuous fine-tuning. The code is open-sourced for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim discuss their research on entity tracking in language models. They argue that understanding how entities change state in discourse is crucial for comprehending longer texts, but there has been little systematic investigation into this ability in pre-trained models. They designed a task involving boxes and objects to evaluate entity tracking, ensuring that models cannot use shortcuts like memorization or simple heuristics. Testing with Flan-T5 and GPT-3 models, they found that only text-davinci-0003 exhibited non-trivial tracking. They suggest that pre-training on code is responsible for this ability. Smaller models like T5-base can learn entity tracking with direct fine-tuning, but pre-training is important. The study's findings are detailed in their paper, available on arXiv.</sample>
    <sample id="307">The authors used several evaluation metrics to assess the performance of their models on various downstream tasks. These metrics included:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: This metric measures the ability of the model to correctly identify and classify entities within the text, such as names of people, organizations, and locations.

2. **Classification**: This metric evaluates the model's ability to categorize text into predefined classes or categories.

3. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: This metric assesses the model's ability to assign the correct part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in the text.

4. **Question Answering (QA)**: This metric measures the model's ability to answer questions based on the information provided in the text.

The authors compared their models to six baseline models (CamemBERT OSCAR 138 GB and 4 GB, CamemBERT CCNET, PubMedBERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBER) using these metrics. The evaluation highlighted that models performed best on tasks with data of the same nature as those onwhich the model was trained, but data from heterogeneous sources appeared to be more versatile. Additionally, using more data generally led to better performance.</sample>

NLPositionality compares annotations with real users to study model and dataset positionality, using a Pearson's R correlation score. The study found that datasets and models are most aligned with English-speaking countries and people with a college education, but less aligned with non-binary individuals.

    <sample id="312">MultiInstruct differs from other benchmarks in several key ways:

1. **Multi-Modal Focus**: Unlike most previous works that focused on improving zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, MultiInstruct specifically targets multi-modal tasks, including those involving images and text.

2. **Instruction Tuning for Multi-Modal**: It introduces the concept of instruction tuning for multi-modal pre-trained models, which has not been extensively explored in prior research.

3. **Dataset Construction**: MultiInstruct is the first large-scale, publicly-available multi-modal instruction tuning benchmark dataset. It consists of 62 diverse multi-modal tasks derived from 21 existing open-source datasets, each equipped with five expert-written instructions.

4. **Unified Token Space**: The dataset uses a unified token space for processing various input and output data types, including text, images, instructions, and bounding boxes, which is a significant departure from the separate token spaces used in previous works.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: MultiInstruct introduces a new evaluation metric called sensitivity, which measures the model's ability to consistently produce the correct outputs for the same task despite slight variations in instruction wording.

6. **Transfer Learning**: The dataset supports transfer learning from natural instruction datasets, which has been shown to improve both performance and sensitivity in multi-modal instruction tuning.

7. **Scalability**: MultiInstruct is designed to be scalable, with plans to expand the dataset to include around 150 additional vision-language tasks, making it a comprehensive resource for future research in multi-modal instruction tuning.

Overall, MultiInstruct represents a significant advancement in the field by addressing the gap in multi-modal instruction tuning and providing a robust, scalable dataset for research and development.</sample>

This suggests that smaller models can surpass larger models in constrained language planning tasks when they are fine-tuned on specialized datasets like CoScript.

    <sample id="317">The presentation by Peng Li from Fudan University introduces "CodeIE," a novel approach to information extraction using large code generation models. Information extraction involves extracting structured information from unstructured text, such as named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). Traditional methods use pre-trained language models like T5 and GPT3, which operate in a text-to-text manner during pre-training but face challenges during inference due to mismatched outputs between plain text and structured formats.

CodeIE addresses this issue by transforming the text-to-structured information extraction task into structure-to-structure code generation. This approach leverages code large language models like Codex, ensuring aligned structures in the output. For NER, a function is defined to extract named entities from input text, and few-shot in-context demonstrations help the model generate the correct structures.

The evaluation on three NER datasets and four RE datasets showed that CodeIE significantly outperformed traditional models like UIE and GPT-3. The analysis revealed that code format prompts better align with the information extraction task, reduce structural errors, and improve recall. Codex consistently outperformed GPT-3, especially in terms of recall. The paper and code are publicly available, offering insights and inspiration for future research in information extraction.</sample>

3. **Control pre-training**: Using the weight and tokenization of a pre-trained model (e.g., CamemBERT) and training it on a new dataset.

The study compares the performance of these strategies on a range of downstream tasks in the French language, using different datasets and model architectures.</sample>
    <sample id="320">The factor of overfitting due to test reuse, as observed in the study, is indicated by the gradient of the best fit line in the graph. The gradient being greater than one suggests that for every unit of improvement made on the CoNLL-2003 dataset, there is more than one unit of improvement on the CoNLL++ dataset. This implies that there is no diminishing returns, and thus, adaptive overfitting is not observed in this case. The exact numerical value of the factor is not provided in the summary, but the key takeaway is that the improvement on the new test set (CoNLL++) is disproportionately higher than the improvement on the original test set (CoNLL-2003).</sample>

Additionally, the corpus was used as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of automatic alignment methods, with the best method identified as MASSalign. Furthermore, the corpus was used to fine-tune language models for automatic text simplification, with the results showing that the fine-tuned models could produce simplified text with better scores than baseline models.</sample>
    <sample id="322">Enrico's presentation at ACL 23 focuses on the question, "What does a Text Classifer Learn about Morality?" He explains that morality is the internal compass that helps us distinguish right from wrong, and it is essential for language models to understand and recognize morality in language. However, morality is subjective and can be interpreted differently by different people. Enrico introduces the Moral Foundation Theory, which suggests that there are five different ways in which humans perceive morality, and each person prioritizes these foundations differently. Enrico's research aims to understand what language models learn about morality by applying explainable AI techniques to language models trained to understand morality in text. He uses a dataset called Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus, composed of 20,000 tweets collected in seven different moral domains, to explore how morality is expressed differently across different domains. Enrico's research shows that language models can recognize that morality can be expressed differently in different domains, and using just a single model for many different domains can lead to misunderstandings of morality.</sample>
    <sample id="323">Yujie Wang from Shanxi University presents a paper titled "Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with LanguageModels and Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense QA." Commonsense QA is a challenging task that requires understanding language and common knowledge. The paper addresses the issue of noisy entities and limited interaction between language models and knowledge bases in existing methods. The proposed method, DHLK, builds an HKG using multiple knowledge bases and optimizes its structure and representation. It removes subwords and retrieves paraphrases of key entities to form the HKG. The method uses RoBERTa and Mask Self-Attention to fuse QA contexts and entities, dynamically removing entities with weaker relevance. It introduces TransE to optimize entity and relationship embeddings and uses Relation Mask Self-Attention to model subgraphs. The method incorporates HKG path information into the QA context and predicts the answer using a combination of HKG graph embedding, paths, and QA context embedding. Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA show that DHLK outperforms other LM and HKG methods.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Yes, language models exhibit different political biases. These biases can be traced from the pretraining data, which often includes a diverse range of political perspectives, to the language models themselves, and subsequently to their performance on downstream tasks. For example, studies have shown that models like GPT-4 tend to be more liberal, while BART series and its variants are generally more socially liberal. Additionally, language models can reflect societal polarization, with models trained on data from after the 45th president of the United States showing a shift towards more extreme political views. This can lead to fairness issues in applications like hate speech detection and fake news detection, where models with different political leanings may perform better or worse depending on the target group, potentially marginalizing certain communities. This highlights the need to address the political biases in language models to ensure fair and unbiased NLP applications.</sample>

    <sample id="327">Xiao Xu presents their work "ManagerTower: Aggregating the Insights of Unimodal Experts for Vision-Language Representation Learning" at ACL 2023. The goal of Vision-Language learning is training AI systems to understand both images and text. Recent advancements in transformer-based vision-language models have led to the development of two-tower architectures, which consist of textual and visual encoders, and a cross-modal encoder. However, these architectures have limitations in effectively utilizing unimodal semantic knowledge at different levels.

Xiao Xu's work builds upon BridgeTower, which connects multiple unimodal layers with cross-modal layers. They propose ManagerTower, a novel architecture that uses managers to adaptively aggregate insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels, facilitating more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion. ManagerTower achieves superior performance on various downstream tasks with only four million images for visual language pre-training.

The paper demonstrates that ManagerTower significantly improves performance compared to BridgeTower, allowing more effective exploitation of different levels of universal semantic information. The work is available on Archive and Github, and the authors hope it can be useful to the community.</sample>

    <sample id="329">In this work, we address the challenge of zero-shot video sentence localization, a task that aims to find the most relevant video segments for a given natural language query. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotations, which are costly and inefficient. We propose a noise-resistant Structured Pseudo-Label generation method to train video sentence localization models without manual annotations. Our approach involves generating complex pseudo-queries using a pre-trained image caption model and creating pseudo-events based on event temporal structure to ensure high relevance between videos within the event and the query, and low relevance outside the event. We reduce the influence of label noise by re-weighting samples and refining labels. Experiments on ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets show that our method outperforms existing zero-shot methods on most metrics, achieving the best zero-shot performance.</sample>

    <sample id="333">The presentation introduces a novel training framework called INK (Injecting kNN Knowledge in Nearest Neighbor Machine Translations) developed by Wenhao and collaborators from Nanjing University, Shanghai AI Lab, and the University of Hong Kong. The framework aims to enhance the generalization and performance of neural machine translation (NMT) models by smoothing the representation space. NMT models often produce non-smooth representation spaces, leading to poor performance in low-frequency token areas. INK addresses this issue by injecting kNN knowledge into the NMT model, which smooths predictions based on nearest neighbors in the representation space.

The INK framework consists of two steps: first, kNN knowledge is extracted from a datastore to guide the adapter to adjust the representation, and then updated representations are used to refresh the datastore asynchronously until convergence. The framework optimizes the adapter with a combined learning objective and runs the training loop until convergence.

Experiments show that the INK system outperforms the state-of-the art kNN-MT system and achieves the best translation performance with less memory space and faster inference speed. The INK system achieves an average gain of 3.98 COMET score and 1.0 BLEA score compared to the state-of-the-art kNN-MT. The framework also demonstrates that jointly applying an adapter and datastore can further smooth predictions, indicating that the representation space of the NMT model can be further refined.</sample>

OOV words are critical for model performance but are difficult to represent. The approach leverages word formation and association to infer the meaning and representation of OOV words.

The method introduces a Word Relationship Graph that imitates lexical rules, with wordpieces of OOV words forming a two-level graph. Each wordpiece acts as a node, with its embedding as the node attribute. The first layer preserves complete wordpiece information, while the second layer samples nodes to mitigate noise.

To assign attributes to OOV nodes, a self-attention network is used, followed by two levels of Graph Attention Network to reduce noise and capture important information. A readout block layer provides a graph-level representation, and contrastive learning is applied to the loss function to encourage proximity between relevant nodes.

Experiments show that the model outperforms baselines in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning OOV words through word formation. The model can benefit both static and contextual models in downstream tasks. While agglutinative languages are well-suited, fusional languages present challenges, but the model performs well with English word segmentation. The application to other languages depends on the rationality of word decomposition.</sample>
    <sample id="338">Good day everyone. My name is Binsheng, and I am presenting our research titled "Are Human Explanations Always Helpful?" This collaborative work involves researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeast University, and IBM Research. Our study aims to evaluate the quality of human natural language explanations, which are often used to train models to generate human-understandable explanations and improve prediction performance and reasoning ability.

We address the challenge of evaluating the quality of human explanations, which can be subjective and task-dependent. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE focus on word similarity, while the simulatability score measures the performance change when explanations are present or absent. However, these metrics do not consider task differences and the utility of explanations during fine-tuning and inference stages, which is where our work comes in.

We selected five popular large-scale datasets for various tasks, including commonsense QA, natural language inference, and commonsense validations. We introduced a template-based unified data format that converts various task formats into a unified multiple-choice task. We conducted in-depth experiments to analyze the utility of explanations, finding that fine-tuning with explanations can lead to substantial improvement.

We propose a novel evaluation metric called TREU, extending the simulatability score. Our evaluation demonstrates that TREU outperforms simulatability scores for evaluating human explanations. We emphasize that our work lays the foundation</sample>

    <sample id="340">Kuan-Hao Huang and colleagues from UCLA present "ParaAMR," a large-scale, syntactically diverse paraphrase generation dataset created using AMR (Abstract Meaning Representations) back-translation. The dataset contains around 15 million source sentences, each with approximately 6.9 paraphrases, offering a significant increase in scale compared to existing human-annotated datasets like MRPC and PAN. The key idea behind ParaAMR is to leverage AMR graphs to introduce syntactic diversity in paraphrases. By modifying the focus node and edges in the AMR graph, the team generates paraphrases that maintain semantic similarity while varying in syntax. Quantitative and human evaluations show that ParaAMR achieves high semantic similarity scores comparable to other datasets but with superior syntactic diversity. The dataset is demonstrated to enhance various NLP applications, including sentence embeddings, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few-shot learning. ParaAMR is available for public use, offering a valuable resource for advancing paraphrase generation and related NLP tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="342">Hello everyone, my name is Gao Jingsheng, and I am presenting our paper titled "LiveChat: A Large-Scale Personalized Dialoge Dataset Automatically Constructed from Live Streaming." This paper, conducted by me, Lian Yixin, and our team from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Xiaobin.AI, explores the development of a video-sourced dialogue dataset that closely resembles real spoken conversations.

The paper begins by discussing the concept of Open Domain Dialogue, which refers to conversational exchanges between humans and AI systems covering a wide range of topics without a specific goal. Existing large-scale dialogue datasets are primarily text-sourced, and there is a need for video-sourced datasets to better capture real spoken conversations. However, these datasets are limited in scale due to manual annotations and instructions.

To address these limitations, we propose LiveChat, a large-scale personalized dialogue dataset with a unique automatic dialogue-constructing method that captures reply-to relationships among speakers. LiveChat is constructed in three steps: extracting videos from Chinese TikTok, transcribing audio into utterances, and collecting audience comments to construct dialogues. We also collect persona information for personalized dialogue generation.

Our experiments show that the selected persona profiles and average sessions per persona are advantageous in learning the personalized response. The performance of BART, a pre-trained dialogue model, is better than other models, indicating the distinctiveness of our LiveChat dataset.

In conclusion, we propose LiveChat as a Chinese video-sourced and personalized dialogue dataset, and our experiments demonstrate its potential for improving the performance of dialogue models. In the future, we will focus on efficient transfer learning of LLMs for LiveChat to further enhance its capabilities.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree-based methods include the need for formalistic pre-processing of logical forms, which can be computationally expensive and complicated, especially when handling variable symbols. Additionally, obtaining trees may involve specialized grammar-induction procedures. These methods also rely on trees to capture the compositional process, which can limit their flexibility and expressiveness.</sample>
    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a novel approach to compositional generalization in semantic parsing without relying on trees. The authors propose a neural seq2seq model that directly models correspondences between input and output fragments. The model first tags each input token with an unordered multiset representing the output, then uses another model to predict a permutation to order the tokens. This method outperforms existing treeless models on the COGS benchmark, demonstrating strong generalization to deeper recursion. The authors address technical challenges, such as the lack of alignment between input and output in the training data and the NP-hard nature of finding the highest-scoring permutation. They approximate the permutation problem with a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation, allowing backpropagation and learning of linguistically plausible permutations. The paper presents experimental results and discusses the challenges and solutions in detail.</sample>

    <sample id="350">The presentation discusses the concept of superhuman performance in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and the challenges associated with evaluating it. It highlights that leaderboard-based evaluation has become the standard in NLP, with systems often achieving human-level or superhuman performance on popular benchmarks like SuperGLUE and SQuAD. However, the paper argues that these achievements may not accurately reflect true human performance due to several issues.

Firstly, the comparison between humans and systems is often unfair because they are evaluated on different subsets of the test data. Secondly, there are errors in the ground-truth answers, which can lead to misleading comparisons. Thirdly, the term "human baseline" is often vaguely estimated, and simple aggregation methods are used to compare system performance with human performance. Additionally, pay rates for human annotators vary considerably across tasks, and the details about the annotator pool are often not provided, making claims about superhuman performance scientifically meaningless.

The paper concludes that to avoid repeating these mistakes, researchers should construct more reliable benchmarks and provide more detailed information about the annotator pool and evaluation process. The authors recommend reading their paper for more information on the consequences of the identified issues and recommendations to improve the evaluation of NLU systems.</sample>
    <sample id="351">This paper investigates the generalization of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models trained on the CoNLL-2003 dataset to modern data. The authors developed the CoNLL++ dataset, which consists of Reuters News articles from 2020 annotated with the same CoNLL-2013 guidelines. They fine-tuned over 20 models on the CoNLL-2000 dataset and evaluated them on both the CoNLL-2003 and CoNLL++ test sets. The results showed that transformer models, larger model sizes, and more fine-tuning examples are necessary for good generalization. The authors also identified two main causes of performance drop: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. Adaptive overfitting was not observed, while temporal drift was confirmed as the main cause of performance degradation. The authors conclude that for good generalization, a combination of a better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine-tuning examples is needed. The study found that CoNLL-2003 tagger models still work well in 2023, and the authors hope their work will inspire further research on improving model generalizations.</sample>

Martens, and Iryna Gurevych addresses the challenge of input underspecification in code generation and program synthesis. The authors propose a method to generate code by asking clarification questions to gather more specifications. They introduce the task of generating code by asking clarification questions and propose a method to create a synthetic dataset with clarifications on key operations. The authors also propose a pipeline of code generation by asking clarification question, which consists of a Clarification Need Predictor, a Question selector, and a Code Generator. The authors evaluate their pipeline on a dataset of Python code and find that their method improves the performance of code generation. They also analyze the errors and suggest potential directions for improvement. The authors conclude that clarified key operations are the reason for better generated code and that their method is a promising approach for addressing the challenge of input underspecification in code synthesis.</sample>
    <sample id="354">Based on the information provided in the presentation, the performance delta between CoNLL-2103 and CoNLL++ is higher than 5 percentage points for models that were fine-tuned on CoNLL-2003 and evaluated on CoNLL++. The specific year when this performance delta exceeds 5 percentage points is not explicitly mentioned in the presentation. However, it is noted that the performance drop is primarily due to temporal drift, which becomes more pronounced with a larger temporal gap between the training and test data. Therefore, the performance delta is likely to be higher for models fine-tuned on older datasets like CoNLL-2003 when evaluated on more recent datasets like CoNLL++.</sample>

The project focuses on using counterfactual scenarios to avoid memorizing spurious patterns in the data. The researchers use a dynamic margin metric learning loss to adjust the training procedure and improve the model's performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. The results show that adding the CounterComp loss consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, especially when the number of reasoning steps grows. The researchers also show that the model attends to more meaningful tokens during training, which relates to more meaningful operational terms in the output.
