    <sample id="88">Hi, my name is Matthias Lindemann, and today I'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="89">This is joint work with my advisors Alexander Kollar and Ivan Itenberg.</sample>
    <sample id="90">Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training.</sample>
    <sample id="91">In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this: as usual, we have a training set of utterances, in this case, 'the girl slept' and 'mary knew that the girl slept'.</sample>
    <sample id="92">These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning.</sample>
    <sample id="93">In contrast to standard machine learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="94">In this example, the model has seen shallow recursion during training and is tested on examples with deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="95">Naive sequence-to-sequence models struggle with this kind of out-of-distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input.</sample>
    <sample id="96">The response is: They often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output, such as those that are color-coded in the example.</sample>
    <sample id="97">解决这个问题的流行方法是把树集成到模型中。</sample>
    <sample id="98">The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with the logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="99">This works well, but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow.</sample>
    <sample id="100">This can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process. Typically, this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms. For example, to handle variable symbols.</sample>
    <sample id="101">Obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures.</sample>
    <sample id="102">In this paper, we don't use trees and introduce a neural sequence-to-sequence model that directly models the correspondences between fragments of the input and fragments of the output.</sample>
    <sample id="103">For the first time, we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without relying on trees.</sample>
    <sample id="104">Our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps.</sample>
    <sample id="105">First, we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="106">After the first step, we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered.</sample>
    <sample id="107">That's why in the second step we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order.</sample>
    <sample id="108">We introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations. This makes our approach quite flexible and expressive.</sample>
    <sample id="109">Conceptually, our permutation model works roughly like this.</sample>
    <sample id="110">We go from left to right over the output and determine which multiset token to put in every position. For the first output position, we simply select one as highlighted in red.</sample>
    <sample id="111">Then we jump to the next multiset token to determine the second token in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="112">We determine the third token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multiset token. We continue this process.</sample>
    <sample id="113">"Until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once."</sample>
    <sample id="114">To give you a teaser of the experimental results, here we compare our method with other tree-less models on the Cogs benchmark. Our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="115">Some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging though.</sample>
    <sample id="116">In our paper, we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges.</sample>
    <sample id="117">First of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data. As a consequence, for a given token, we don't know which multiset it came from. Which poses a challenge for training.</sample>
    <sample id="118">In addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data, but the linguistically correct one is latent. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training.</sample>
    <sample id="119">Our permutation method is very flexible, but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is NP hard. That's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem.</sample>
    <sample id="120">We approximate this with a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="121">If you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges, please have a look at our paper or come to our poster.</sample>
    <sample id="122">The introduced framework quantifies the positionality by comparing end users with models and datasets predictions and labels, rather than just looking at annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions.</sample>

    <sample id="125">### Introduction to Weak Supervision and Weakly Supervised Learning

In the realm of machine learning, the quest for efficient and effective training of models has led to the exploration of various supervision strategies. Among these, weak supervision and weakly supervised learning have emerged as powerful approaches that leverage less precise or noisy labels to train models. This introduction aims to provide a concise overview of these concepts, their significance, and their applications.

#### What is Weak Supervision?

Weak supervision refers to the practice of using imperfect or noisy labels to train machine learning models. Unlike strong supervision, where labels are typically accurate and manually annotated, weak supervision relies on labels that may be derived from heuristics, crowdsourcing, or other automated processes. These labels are often less reliable and may contain errors, but they are still valuable for training models, especially when strong supervision is unavailable or too costly.

#### Key Characteristics of Weak Supervision

1. **Noisy Labels**: Weak supervision often involves labels that are not perfectly accurate. These labels may contain errors, inconsistencies, or ambiguities, but they can still provide useful information for training models.

2. **Heuristics and Rules**: Labels in weak supervision are often generated using heuristics or rules that are designed to approximate the true labels. For example, a heuristic might label all images containing a certain object as belonging to a specific category, even if some images do not actually contain that object.

3. **Crowdsourcing**: In some cases, labels are generated through crowdsourcing, where multiple human annotators provide labels for the same data points. The final label is often determined by aggregating the individual annotations, which can help mitigate the impact of noisy labels.

4. **Automated Labeling**: Weak supervision can also involve automated labeling techniques, such as using pre-trained models to generate labels for new data. These labels may not be perfect, but they can still be useful for training models.

#### What is Weakly Supervised Learning?

Weakly supervised learning is a broader concept that encompasses the use of weak supervision in the training of machine learning models. It involves designing algorithms and techniques that can effectively learn from noisy or imperfect labels, often with the goal of improving model performance and reducing the need for strong supervision.

#### Key Characteristics of Weakly Supervised Learning

1. **Robustness to Noisy Labels**: Weakly supervised learning algorithms are designed to be robust to noisy labels, meaning they can still achieve good performance even when the labels are imperfect.

2. **Scalability**: Weakly supervised learning techniques are often scalable, making them suitable for large datasets where strong supervision is impractical.

3. **Flexibility**: These techniques can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering, and can be used with various types of data, such as images, text, and audio.

4. **Active Learning**: Weakly supervised learning often involves active learning, where the algorithm iteratively selects the most informative data points to label, thereby improving the quality of the labels over time.

#### Applications of Weak Supervision and Weakly Supervised Learning</sample>
    <sample id="126">In weak supervision, we do not manually label the data. Instead, we label the data using weak labeling sources, such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low-quality crowdsourcing. As illustrated in the figure on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="127">When compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect.</sample>
    <sample id="128">If we directly train neural networks on weekly label data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize.</sample>
    <sample id="129">In weakly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise, so that the trained models still generalize well.</sample>
    <sample id="130">In recent works in WSL, which stands for weekly supervised learning, a common claim is that people say that the only train models on the weekly label data and achieve high performance on clean test sets.</sample>
    <sample id="131">### Technical Analysis of the Claim

#### Claim:
"Technically, this claim is not wrong, but there's a catch."

#### Breakdown:

1. **Technical Accuracy:**
   - The claim acknowledges that, from a technical standpoint, the statement or argument being made is not inherently incorrect. This means that the underlying facts or principles supporting the claim are valid and can be substantiated through evidence or logical reasoning.

2. **Catch or Caveat:**
   - The phrase "but there's a catch" introduces a nuance or limitation to the initial claim. This "catch" could be a number of things, such as:
     - **Contextual Limitations:** The claim may hold true only under specific conditions or in certain scenarios, and not universally.
     - **Assumptions:** The claim might be based on assumptions that are not universally accepted or that may not hold in all situations.
     - **Oversimplification:** The claim might oversimplify a complex issue, ignoring important factors that could affect the outcome.
     - **Potential for Misinterpretation:** The claim could be open to misinterpretation, leading to misunderstandings or incorrect conclusions.

3. **Implications:**
   - The presence of a "catch" suggests that while the claim is technically correct, it should be approached with caution. It implies that further analysis or consideration of additional factors is necessary to fully understand the implications of the claim.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The claim is not wrong, but it is important to recognize the limitations and potential pitfalls associated with it. This awareness allows for a more nuanced and informed understanding of the topic at hand.

#### Example:
- **Claim:** "Eating vegetables is good for your health."
- **Technical Accuracy:** This statement is generally true, as vegetables are rich in nutrients and can contribute to a healthy diet.
- **Catch:** However, the claim doesn't account for individual dietary needs, potential allergies, or the quality of the vegetables consumed. Additionally, it doesn't consider the overall balance of one's diet, which is crucial for optimal health.

In summary, while the claim is technically correct, it is important to be aware of the "catch" that may limit its applicability or accuracy in certain contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="132">The statement suggests that individuals tend to believe that there is an additional clean validation set available for model selection. This implies that people might think there is a separate, untainted dataset that can be used to evaluate the performance of a model, separate from the training and testing datasets. However, in practice, such a clean validation set is not typically available, and the validation set used during model training is often the same as the one used for final evaluation. This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Therefore, it is important to use proper cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model's performance is robust and generalizable.</sample>
    <sample id="133">We can't stop on this problem setting as this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weekly supervised learning, but like an elephant in the room, this necessity is often overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="134">The aforementioned doubt leads us to ask three research questions. First, is clean validation data necessary for WSL? Or can we maybe use a noisy validation set instead?</sample>
    <sample id="135">1. Second, if clean data is required or if clean data is mandatory for WSL to work, then how many clean samples do we need? Finally, should we only use the clean samples for validation, or are there better ways to utilize them?</sample>
    <sample id="136">In our work, we have addressed these research questions and our findings are as follows:</sample>
    <sample id="137">First, we find that interestingly, recent WSL methods indeed require clean white dish samples to work properly.</sample>
    <sample id="138">1. The text discusses the impact of having clean validation samples on the performance of trend models.
2. It mentions that without clean validation samples, trend models may not generalize beyond the original weak labels.
3. The text suggests that having clean validation samples is crucial for improving the performance of trend models.</sample>
    <sample id="139">The statement "meaning that the training is pointless" suggests that the training being referred to is considered to be without value or purpose. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as the training not being relevant to the job or task at hand, the training being poorly designed or delivered, or the training not being effective in achieving its intended goals.

When training is deemed pointless, it can have negative consequences for both the individual and the organization. For the individual, pointless training can be a waste of time and resources, leading to frustration and disengagement. For the organization, pointless training can result in a lack of productivity, decreased employee morale, and a negative impact on the overall performance of the team or department.

To avoid pointless training, it is important for organizations to carefully consider the needs and goals of their employees and to design training programs that are relevant, effective, and engaging. This may involve conducting needs assessments, gathering feedback from employees, and using data and metrics to measure the effectiveness of training programs. By taking a strategic and thoughtful approach to training, organizations can ensure that their employees are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their roles, while also avoiding the pitfalls of pointless training.</sample>
    <sample id="140">This indicates that WSL approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly, and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="141">Our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="142">Typically, we only need 20 samples per class to achieve high performance.</sample>
    <sample id="143">But that's not the end of the story, because if we either way decide to access clean samples, then training on them directly will even achieve better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="144">The right figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches, which are directly applied on the clean data, and WSL approaches, which use the clean data for validation only.</sample>
    <sample id="145">As we can see, if we have ten samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat WSL approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="146">Finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="147">The figure shows that the vanilla model, referred to as ftw, initially underperforms more complicated wsl methods like cosine.</sample>
    <sample id="148">However, if we want to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples, then ftw performs equally well as other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="149">In practice, there is no reason to choose more complex WSL methods, which require more computation time and disk space.</sample>
    <sample id="150">In summary, we have demonstrated that recent WSL approaches require clean, manually annotated samples for them to function effectively. Their performance gains and practicality are often overestimated.</sample>
    <sample id="151">Our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows:</sample>
    <sample id="152">First, report the model selection criteria. For example, report if the model selection is done with clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="153">1. The second point emphasizes the importance of comparing WSL approaches with few-shot learning baselines, as both work on clean samples.
2. The third point highlights the significance of continuous fine-tuning as a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL.</sample>

    <sample id="160">One author is involved in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="161">By comparing end users with models and datasets, predictions, and labels, as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling.</sample>
    <sample id="162">The setup that overlaps the most with the lexicon of stereotypes is the one that uses the lexicon of stereotypes to generate personas. This is because the lexicon of stereotypes is a collection of preconceived notions about different groups of people, and the generated personas are based on these stereotypes. Therefore, the personas generated using the lexicon of stereotypes are likely to contain a lot of stereotypes, which is what the question is asking for.</sample>

    <sample id="210">The last research question is: Should we only use the clean samples for validation, or are there better ways to utilize them?</sample>
    <sample id="211">The metric sensitivity measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task, regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction.</sample>
    <sample id="212">The name of the speaker is **Jin Weiyi**.</sample>
    <sample id="213">Greater sensitivity generally indicates improved model performance, as it suggests that the model is more responsive to changes in the input data, which can lead to more accurate predictions. However, it's important to note that sensitivity alone is not a definitive measure of model performance, as it can also lead to overfitting if the model becomes too sensitive to noise in the data. Therefore, it's important to consider other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall when evaluating model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="214">During pretraining, models receive a linguistic context that includes a diverse range of text from the internet, such as books, articles, and websites. This exposure helps them learn the structure, grammar, and semantics of the language. The context is vast and varied, allowing the model to understand different writing styles, topics, and languages. This extensive training enables the model to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.</sample>

Additionally, the MBFC ratings are based on a small sample of news sources, which may not be representative of the entire media landscape.

    <sample id="219">The political bias propagation pipeline refers to the process by which political biases are transmitted and amplified from pre-training data to language models and then to downstream tasks. This pipeline involves several stages, including:

1. **Pre-training Data**: The initial stage where large datasets are used to train language models. These datasets may contain inherent biases based on the sources and the context in which the data was collected.

2. **Language Models**: The models that learn from the pre-training data. These models can inherit and propagate the biases present in the training data.

3. **Downstream Tasks**: The final stage where the language models are applied to specific tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or other NLP applications. The biases present in the models can influence the outcomes of these tasks.

The pipeline specifically addresses the following questions:

- How do political biases propagate from pre-training data to language models?
- What are the mechanisms through which these biases are amplified during the training process?
- How do these biases affect the performance and fairness of downstream tasks?
- What strategies can be employed to mitigate or reduce political biases in the pipeline?

By investigating these aspects, the goal is to understand and address the potential fairness issues that arise from political biases in language models and their applications.</sample>

2. **Training involves different optimization objectives**, requiring the training and maintenance of several models to achieve different latency regimes.
3. **Training a model with one latency regime (e.g., 1 second) and another with a different latency regime (e.g., 2 seconds) can be complex and resource-intensive**.

These issues highlight the challenges in optimizing SimulST models for different latency requirements.</sample>
    <sample id="275">An effective way to mitigate social and political biases in NLP model training datasets is to carefully curate and balance the data to include diverse perspectives, ensuring that the training data is representative of the real-world population. This involves identifying and addressing biases in the data collection process, using techniques such as data augmentation, and employing fairness-aware algorithms during model training. Additionally, it's important to continuously monitor and evaluate the model's performance to detect and correct any biases that may emerge during deployment.</sample>

    <sample id="313">Hello, I am Si Yuyuan from Fudan University. I am here to introduce our work, which involves distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="314">In daily life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of granted scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="315">1. The previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as making a cake, and shows that large language models can effectively decompose goals into steps.
2. The previous work has explored language models to make plans for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such making a cake, and shows that large language can effectively decompose goals into steps.
3. The previous work has explored language models to decompose abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as make a cake, and shows that large language models effectively decompose goals into steps.
4. The previous work has explored language models to break down abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as cake, and shows that large language models can decompose goals into steps.
5. The previous work has explored language models to deconstruct abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as a cake, and shows that large language models are effective in decomposing goals into steps.</sample>
    <sample id="316">1. However, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities. Planning for the goals with specific constraints, such as making a chocolate cake, still remains understudied.
2. The abstract goals of stereotypical activities are often the focus of previous work, but planning for specific goals with constraints, such as making a chocolate cake, is still not well understood.
3. While previous work has focused on planning for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, planning for specific goals with constraints, such as baking a chocolate cake, remains an understudied area.
4. The focus of previous work has been on planning for abstract goals of stereotypical activities. However, planning for specific goals with constraints, such making a chocolate cake, is still not well studied.
5. Previous work has mainly focused on planning for abstract goals of stereotypical actions. However, planning for specific goals with constraints such as making a chocolate cake is still not well understood.</sample>
    <sample id="317">In this paper, we define the problem of constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="318">1. Which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning?
An abstract goal can be inherited by different real-life specific goals with multifaceted constraints.
2. A good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="319">In this paper, we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="320">Since no data set of specific goals exists to support our study, we will need to collect our own data. This can be done through surveys, interviews, or observations. It is important to ensure that the data collected is reliable and valid, and that it is representative of the population being studied. Once the data is collected, it can be analyzed using statistical methods to identify patterns and trends. This will help us to draw conclusions about the specific goals of the study and their impact on the population being studied.</sample>
    <sample id="321">We need to acquire these goals first. As shown in the table, we extend the abstract goals with multifaceted constraints for human in the loop data acquisition using instruct gpt.</sample>
    <sample id="322">We sampled one hundred specific goals and evaluated the scripts generated from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="323">This table reports the overall accuracy of the results. We find that all language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Then, we conduct a detailed analysis to investigate why learning models fail.</sample>
    <sample id="325">The results in the figure show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed.</sample>
    <sample id="326">1. We delve into more fine-grained topic categories of constraints defined in waking home. The heat map in the figure shows that the planning performance of instruct gpd varies considerably for goals of different categories.

2. The heat map in the figure shows that there are significant differences in the planning performance of instruct gpd for goals of different categories.

3. The planning performance of instruct gpd varies considerably for different categories of goals, as shown in the heat map in the figure.

4. The heat map in the figure indicates that there are significant differences in the planning performance for instruct gpd across different categories of goals.

5. The figure's heat map reveals that the planning performance of instruct gpd varies significantly for goals of different categories.</sample>
    <sample id="327">Previous studies have shown that the output quality of language models falls in high variance, leading to bad performance. Thus, we adopt the idea of over-generating the then filter to improve generation quality.</sample>
    <sample id="328">We first show constraint types with examples for inject gpt and obtain specific goals based on the set abstract goals.</sample>
    <sample id="329">GPT-4 is capable of generating code scripts for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="330">### Next, a filter model is developed to select the faithful scripts.

In the next phase, a filter model is created to identify and select the faithful scripts. This model is designed to ensure that only the most accurate and reliable scripts are chosen for further analysis or use. The development of this filter model involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a comprehensive dataset of scripts, including both faithful and unfaithful examples. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the filter model.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Identifying and extracting relevant features from the scripts that can help distinguish between faithful and unfaithful scripts. These features may include linguistic patterns, structural elements, and other contextual cues.

3. **Model Training**: Using the extracted features and the labeled dataset, the filter model is trained to recognize the characteristics of faithful scripts. This involves applying machine learning algorithms to learn the patterns that differentiate faithful scripts from unfaithful ones.

4. **Model Validation**: Testing the filter model on a separate validation dataset to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This step helps to fine-tune the model and identify any potential biases or errors.

5. **Deployment**: Once the filter model is validated, it is deployed to automatically select faithful scripts from new, unseen data. This ensures that only the most accurate and reliable scripts are processed further.

By developing this filter model, the process of selecting faithful scripts becomes more efficient and accurate, reducing the risk of errors and improving the overall quality of the analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="331">We convert scripts and goals into instruction GPT embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity.</sample>
    <sample id="332">In addition, we award the script that contains the keywords of the target constraint. We only keep the script if the target goal scores the highest in the goal set.</sample>
    <sample id="333">With our method, InstrGPT can generate scripts of higher quality. Our method greatly improves the planning ability, both in semantic completeness and faithfulness to the constraint.</sample>
    <sample id="334">Since large language models are costly to deploy, it's essential to enable language planning ability of smaller and specialized models. Creating a dataset is an essential step to its end.</sample>
    <sample id="335">However, previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals, and manual data set annotation is expensive.</sample>
    <sample id="336">In this work, we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning datasets from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="337">We will apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning, named as codescript.</sample>
    <sample id="338">In total, we generate 55,000 specific goals with scripts. To ensure the quality of validation and test sets, we ask crowd-sourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="339">This figure shows the constraint distribution of code script. We find code script shows high polymorphism in the generated specific goals. With code script, we can train smaller but specialized models for constraint language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="340">We find that t5 fine tune on the code rate can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models, indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable data sets.</sample>
    <sample id="341">In summary, we established the constrained language planning problem, evaluated the constrained language planning ability of large language models, and developed an overgeneration filter method for large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="342">We use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset called 'co-script' for constrained language planning. We hope that the co-script dataset can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="371">Hello, I'm James Finch and I'm Sarah Finch. And today we'll tell you all about ABC Eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI.</sample>
    <sample id="372">This work was done by the Emory NLP lab led by Professor Gino Choi at Emory University and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI.</sample>
    <sample id="373">Sure, here's a text transcript of the English content:

---

**Text Transcript:**

So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art.

---

This transcript captures the essence of the content, which is about evaluating a newly developed dialogue model against existing state-of-the-art models.</sample>
    <sample id="374">The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale.</sample>
    <sample id="375">These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality, but dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore, you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level.</sample>
    <sample id="376">One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or likert scale methods.</sample>
    <sample id="377">However, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="378">Our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself.</sample>
    <sample id="379">We call this approach annotating behaviors in chat, or ABC eval in short. We developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature.</sample>
    <sample id="380">ABC-Eval is a tool designed to measure the rates at which chat models commit various thematic errors. It provides a structured framework for evaluating the performance of these models in terms of their ability to maintain coherence and relevance in conversations. The tool assesses the models' responses to a set of predefined prompts, focusing on the accuracy and appropriateness of the information they provide. By analyzing the frequency and types of errors, researchers and developers can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different chat models, guiding improvements in their design and functionality.</sample>
    <sample id="381">For example, ABC eval measures the number of turns in which a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant.</sample>
    <sample id="382">The text you've provided seems to be a set of criteria or guidelines for evaluating the performance of a model, possibly in the context of natural language processing or artificial intelligence. Here's a breakdown of the content:

1. **Contradicts itself or its partner**: This suggests that the model should not present information that is inconsistent with itself or with other models or sources. It's important for a model to maintain internal consistency and coherence.

2. **Presents incorrect facts or violates common sense knowledge**: This indicates that the model should not generate or provide information that is factually incorrect or that goes against general world knowledge. It's crucial for a model to be accurate and reliable.

3. **When the model succeeds or fails to show empathy**: This part of the text seems to be incomplete or unclear. It might be referring to the model's ability to understand and respond to emotional cues or to show empathy in its interactions. If the model fails to demonstrate empathy, it could be a significant drawback, especially in applications where understanding and responding to human emotions is important.

Overall, these criteria are important for evaluating the quality and reliability of a model, particularly in tasks that require understanding and generating human-like text.</sample>
    <sample id="383">To determine what kind of evaluation is most effective, we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on one hundred human bot conversations per model using ABC eval.</sample>
    <sample id="384">For comparison, we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods: liquor ratings on the turn level, liquor ratings on the dialogue level, and dialogue level pairwise comparisons.</sample>
    <sample id="385">For each of the existing methods, we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions.</sample>
    <sample id="386">From our analyses of these evaluation results, we found that ABC behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods, as measured by inter-annotator agreement on 100 doubly labeled conversations.</sample>
    <sample id="387">In addition, ABC eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods, as shown by this simple linear regression analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="388">For example, you can see how measuring the proportion of turns with self and partner contradictions explains 5% and 10% of conversation quality respectively, while the average liquor consistency scores explain only 4% or less.</sample>
    <sample id="389">Certainly! Here is a text transcript of the provided content:

---

Finally, we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression.

---

This transcript captures the essence of the content, which discusses the use of stepwise linear regression to determine if each evaluation metric uniquely captures an aspect of chat quality.</sample>
    <sample id="390">You can see how the combination of all ABC eval metrics explains over 25% of conversation quality, and as you remove the metrics one at a time, most of them result in losing a decent amount of information about the quality.</sample>
    <sample id="391">On the other hand, the combination of all turn-level liquor metrics explains far less of the quality and fewer of these metrics carry unique information.</sample>
    <sample id="392">"These reliable, informative, and distinct ABC eval metrics enable us to evaluate conversational AI with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve."</sample>
    <sample id="393">You can see that in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified. For example, the bots we tested have common sense violations in around 20% of their responses.</sample>
    <sample id="394">They produce irrelevant information in around 15% of the responses and they contradict themselves or their partner around 10% of the time.</sample>
    <sample id="395">With the rapid pace of improvement in the field, many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted. However, this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models.</sample>
    <sample id="396">we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="410">The author works with multiple modalities, as indicated by the focus on "multi-modal pre-trained models" in the text.</sample>
    <sample id="411">Hello, I am Janis Lavak, and I will present you our works on Dr. Bert, a robust pre-trained model in French for biomedical and clinical domains.</sample>
    <sample id="412">In this presentation, we first talk about language modeling in healthcare, then we will present the main contribution of our article.</sample>
    <sample id="413">We introduce the first biomedical model  uh  in French named doctor bert which is based on roberta and train on natchez which is a data set of medical crowned data from the web</sample>
    <sample id="414">We also introduce a comparison of model with multiple printing settings and data sources. Then we present our results on eleven biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French.</sample>
    <sample id="415">And finally, we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the models.</sample>
    <sample id="416">Since its release in 2018, BERT has become one of the most effective approaches to solve natural language processing tasks and offer a huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as word2vec.</sample>
    <sample id="417">Since then, this model has been adapted to many other languages like in French with Camembert and other domains like biomedical with permit belt and biobert and on clinical with clinical built but mostly in English.</sample>
    <sample id="418">Specialized models for other languages are scarce and are often based on continual pre-training due to the lack of in-domain data.</sample>
    <sample id="419">However, France did not have any open-source model for biomedical engineering until now.</sample>
    <sample id="420">We so we ask ourselves question about what is the most appropriate data sources for a wide range of usage and those current data are good substitution for clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="421">To answer this question, we compare Doctor Bilt with our Shubert model, which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital at our house.</sample>
    <sample id="422">Afterward, we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on French data. Is it 4 gigabytes, 8 gigabytes, or more?</sample>
    <sample id="423">To answer this question, we first train and compare four from scratch models. A first version of doctor belt with 7 gigabytes of natchez. A second version of 4 gigabytes of set of natchez.</sample>
    <sample id="424">A first version of Shubert, which is a clinical model, with four gigabytes of sentences taken from clinical notes. And a final version of Shubert, with a mix of four gigabytes of set of natchez and four gigabytes of clinical notes.</sample>
    <sample id="425">In addition to this comparison, we introduce three models trained on contextual pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="426">One is based on the weight of camel bear and trained on four gigabytes of set of natchez. Another also based on camel bear but trained this time on the four gigabyte of klinkan notes.</sample>
    <sample id="427">And finally, one base of on the English biomedical model per per minute bit and train on four gigabytes of set of snatches. In total, we have seven models.</sample>
    <sample id="428">To evaluate all seven models, we gather which public and private domains tasks such as name entity recognition, classification, part of speech tagging, and question answering.</sample>
    <sample id="429">This model is compared to six baseline models, which are:

1. Camembert-Oscar 138GB
2. Camembert-Oscar 4GB
3. Camembert-Cicnet 4GB
4. Permet-Bert by Bert
5. Clinical-Bert</sample>
    <sample id="430">The evaluation of a highlight that the model performs best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained.</sample>
    <sample id="431">However, we have we can obtain that data from  uh  we can observe that data from interventional sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translate into better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="432">In general, from-scratch pre-training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="433">However, our experiment on quantum pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of permit bird train on the 4 gigabyte subset of natchez show comparable result to those for obtain with  uh  doctor bert for gigabyte from scratch.</sample>
    <sample id="434">The model based on common bear weights and tokenization suffers from stability issues.</sample>
    <sample id="435">In conclusion, our proposed system offers a better performance on nine of the eleven domains' tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here.</sample>
    <sample id="436">We also observe that specialized data is better. More specialized data is better, but it doesn't scale well.</sample>
    <sample id="437">Yes, all the pre-trained models obtained from Natchez are freely available and on the GitHub page, and all the training scripts are on our GitHub repository.</sample>

    <sample id="537">Hello everyone, my name is Aidan Villar and I will be giving a short overview of the paper "Pruning Parameter-Free Translation: Assessing Strategies and Performance." This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate.</sample>
    <sample id="538">BLOOM is a 540 billion parameter language model presented last year in 2022. It's trained on a large collection of texts comprising 780 billion tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="539">At the time of publication, it achieves state-of-the-art in hundreds of NLP tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="540">In this work, we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="541">We evaluated the transition capability of such models using the best practices of the AI community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="542">And we compare two state-of-the-art systems. So the best performing systems are the WMT evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="543">We use state-of-the-art neural network metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="544">The prompting has a big influence on the performance of the of llms for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one short prompting and provided two different prompts for for just a sentence</sample>
    <sample id="545">The majority of sentences, 516 out of 1000, the difference observed is of more than one blur point.</sample>
    <sample id="546">And this can go in extreme cases up to 40 blur points. So it's important to select a good prompting strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="547">In our experiments, we settled for a five-shot prompting strategy where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in.</sample>
    <sample id="548">In this example, where we perform translation from German into English, the German sentences, the source sentences are marked with German colon and the English translations with English colon.</sample>
    <sample id="549">We saw that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have a big influence in the case of several short promptings.</sample>
    <sample id="550">It's crucial for zero and one-shot prompting, and when we go as in our case to five-shot prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the of the prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="551">It's the examples that carry most of the weight.</sample>
    <sample id="552">The summary of our experimental results is that the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="553">So it's important to select the examples from high-quality translations. In particular, we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the WMT evaluations or the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="554">The dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data, that is more nicely and the results show a better performance when using the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="555">Nevertheless, specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the pump translations. But pump comes pretty close to a commercial system. In our case, we chose to overlay with Google Translate.</sample>
    <sample id="556">The insights that we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state of the art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="557">In particular, the most common error are omission errors.</sample>
    <sample id="558">So it seems that palm chooses them to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are omitted in the translation.</sample>
    <sample id="559">However, the style outward category for pan is lower than for the state of their systems, which is an additional signal.</sample>
    <sample id="560">The program provides really fluent output, but still has some problems with accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="561">And that's it for this really short overview. For more details, please come to the full presentation of the paper. Thank you very much.</sample>

    <sample id="600">National language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources, such as knowledge contained in their parameters, usually acquired by a pre-training, and knowledge given in inputs at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="601">Recent works in tasks like question answering show that models can use pre-trained time knowledge to solve the task.</sample>

"But natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time."</sample>
    <sample id="603">In the sentence "John saw the newly elected president on TV," the English content is as follows:

- "John" is the subject of the sentence, referring to a person.
- "saw" is the verb, indicating the action of seeing.
- "the newly elected president" is the direct object, specifying who John saw.
- "on TV" is a prepositional phrase that provides additional information about where John saw the president.

The sentence is a simple declarative sentence, stating a fact about John's action of seeing the president on television.</sample>

    <sample id="612">We vary the availability of these two pieces of information such that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="613">First, we have the typical setting, background pre-training, where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pre-training time.</sample>
    <sample id="614">Second, there's the background both setting, where background knowledge is available both at pre-train time and inference time. Lastly, the background inference setting, where both knowledge types are available only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="615">This last setting is especially interesting since it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre-trained data of models. For example, because new occupations have developed since the time of pre-training.</sample>
    <sample id="616">Here's an example of how we control the availability of factors to sources:

```python
# Define a dictionary to store the availability of factors for each source
factor_availability = {
    'source1': {'factor1': True, 'factor2': False},
    'source2': {'factor1': True, 'factor3': True},
    'source3': {'factor2': True, 'factor3': False}
}

# Function to check if a factor is available for a given source
def is_factor_available(source, factor):
    if source in factor_availability and factor in factor_availability[source]:
        return factor_availability[source][factor]
    return False

# Example usage
source = 'source1'
factor = 'factor1'
if is_factor_available(source, factor):
    print(f"{factor} is available for {source}.")
else:
    print(f"{factor} is not available for {source}.")
```

In this example, we define a dictionary `factor_availability` that maps each source to a dictionary of factors and their availability. The function `is_factor_available` checks if a given factor is available for a specific source. The example usage demonstrates how to check the availability of a factor for a source.</sample>
    <sample id="617">In the background pre-train setting, we assume that the background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre-train parameters. In the inference time context, we provide the anti-specific knowledge that Chester is a politician.</sample>
    <sample id="618">In the background both setting, we additionally provide not only anti-specific but also background knowledge about politicians in the interference context.</sample>
    <sample id="619">In the background inference setting, we provide the fictional occupation "military tour" instead of "politician" because "military tour" is unlikely to be contained in the pre-trained paraphrase.</sample>
    <sample id="620">We evaluated the dataset both with human study participants and established reference resolution models. In this figure, we show the results of the best performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-trained settings.</sample>
    <sample id="621">"Without task-specific training on KITMOS, both models do not perform well. When trained on KITMOS, however, both C2F and BertForCoref perform significantly better than the random choice."</sample>
    <sample id="622">This suggests that when trained on general reference resolution datasets, models learn to exploit surface cues, which are not useful when testing on kidmos where such cues have been removed.</sample>
    <sample id="623">"Additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best performing models cannot reliably integrate background knowledge to provide only an inference task."</sample>
    <sample id="624">To summarize the main takeaways of our paper, many current reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training. However, with task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="625">"Still, even the best performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating backward knowledge presented only at inference time.

    <sample id="668">Multilingual LLMs such as Codex or Bloom are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="669">Hello everyone, my name is Zhu Heng. Today I'm going to present our paper, "Do Conall 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023." Let's get started.</sample>
    <sample id="670">Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task, or the NER task.</sample>
    <sample id="671">We observe that models have been using Cono 2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years, and this naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data?</sample>
    <sample id="672">When we develop new tags, what is needed for good generalization?</sample>
    <sample id="673">At the same time, if we do observe poor generalization, what causes the performance drop of these models?</sample>
    <sample id="674">To investigate these problems, we developed the Cono++ dataset. This is a dataset that we collected from Reuters news from 2020 and then annotated them with the same Cono 2003 annotation guidelines.</sample>
    <sample id="675">We then fine-tuned over twenty models on Cono 2003. We evaluated them on both the Cono 03 test set and the Cono++ test set.</sample>
    <sample id="676">And last but not least, we calculated the percentage change in F1 to assess the generalization of each model.</sample>
    <sample id="677">So what is needed for a good generalization? Through our experiments, we found that there are three main ingredients that are needed.</sample>
    <sample id="678">The first one is the model architecture. Through our experiments, we found that the transformer models normally generalize better to new data.</sample>
    <sample id="679">The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually larger models lead to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="680">And last but not least, we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task. Here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also leads to better generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="681">To our next question, what causes the performance drop of some models?</sample>
    <sample id="682">We had two hypotheses. The first one is adaptive overfitting, which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again, and this is usually manifested as the diminishing returns on the new test set.</sample>
    <sample id="683">The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data.</sample>
    <sample id="684">For adaptive overfitting, we saw that from the graph on the right, the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one.</sample>
    <sample id="685">This means that every unit of improvement that we made on kernel 2003 translates to more than one unit of improvement on kernel++ which means that there is no diminishing returns.</sample>
    <sample id="686">"and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed."</sample>
    <sample id="687">那么温度怎么样呢？</sample>
    <sample id="688">For temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data, and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap.</sample>
    <sample id="689">And this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift.</sample>
    <sample id="690">Our conclusion is that for good generalization, we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine-tuning examples. And these goals hand in hand, we can't just have one ingredient, but throughout the others.</sample>
    <sample id="691">At the same time, we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift, and kind of surprisingly, it is not caused by adaptive overfitting, even though Cono 2003 has been used for over 20 years.</sample>
    <sample id="692">So going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper, do kernel 2003 taggers still work in 2023? And we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes.</sample>

    <sample id="704">Hi, I'm Maya, and today I'll be talking about our paper "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models." This work is done in collaboration with Essindermush and Dan Jurafsky.</sample>
    <sample id="705">近年来，许多人已经记录了大型语言模型或LLMs中社会偏见和刻板印象的普遍性。</sample>
    <sample id="706">然而，这些措施存在各种限制。它们通常依赖于手工构建的数据集，这些数据集非常耗时。</sample>
    <sample id="707">And they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes, meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts, or they simply capture very general broad associations, like negative associations with particular groups.</sample>
    <sample id="708">Furthermore, most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality, which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm.</sample>
    <sample id="709">To overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned LLMs are very good at responding to instructions and prompts.</sample>
    <sample id="710">So we can ask the model to generate a persona, which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like "imagine you are an Asian woman, describe yourself."</sample>
    <sample id="711">And we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt.</sample>
    <sample id="712">Sure, here are some example generations from GPT-4:

1. **Creative Writing:**
   - "In the heart of the ancient forest, where the trees whispered secrets of old, a young adventurer named Elara discovered a hidden path that led to a forgotten realm. With each step, the air grew thick with magic, and the trees seemed to part to reveal a world of wonder and mystery."

2. **Technical Explanation:**
   - "Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways compared to classical computing. Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, making them particularly useful for complex problems in fields like cryptography, optimization, and material science."

3. **Business Strategy:**
   - "To stay competitive in the rapidly evolving tech industry, companies should focus on continuous innovation and customer-centric approaches. By investing in research and development, fostering a culture of creativity, and leveraging data analytics to understand customer needs, businesses can create products and services that not only meet but exceed market expectations. Additionally, forming strategic partnerships and expanding into emerging markets can provide new growth opportunities and enhance brand visibility."

4. **Personal Development:**
   - "Effective time management is crucial for achieving personal and professional goals. Start by setting clear, achievable objectives and breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks. Prioritize your activities based on their importance and deadlines, and use tools like calendars and to-do lists to stay organized. Additionally, practice mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques to maintain focus and productivity throughout the day."

5. **Scientific Research:**
   - "The study of climate change has revealed significant insights into the impact of human activities on the environment. Researchers have found that rising global temperatures are leading to more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. To mitigate these effects, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy sources, and implement sustainable practices in agriculture and industry."

6. **Cultural Analysis:**
   - "The Renaissance was a period of profound cultural and intellectual transformation in Europe, marked by a revival of interest in classical antiquity and a flourishing of art, literature, and science. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo created masterpieces that continue to inspire awe, while thinkers like Galileo and Copernicus challenged traditional beliefs and laid the groundwork for modern science. The Renaissance also saw the rise of humanism, which emphasized the value and potential of human beings, leading to significant advancements in education and the arts."

7. **Health and Wellness:**
   - "Maintaining a healthy lifestyle involves a combination of regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep. Engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week can improve cardiovascular health, strengthen muscles, and boost mood. Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can provide essential nutrients and support overall well-being. Additionally, getting 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night is crucial for cognitive function, emotional stability, and physical health."

8. **Historical Context:**
   - "The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, was a transformative period that reshaped economies and societies worldwide. The introduction of new technologies, such as the steam engine and mechanized manufacturing, led to increased productivity and the growth of urban centers. However, this period also brought about significant social and environmental challenges, including poor working conditions, child labor, and pollution. The legacy of the Industrial Revolution continues to influence modern industrial practices and economic policies."

9. **Philosophical Inquiry:**
   - "The concept of free will has been a central topic in philosophy for centuries, with debates surrounding whether human actions are determined by external factors or if individuals have the ability to make independent choices. Some philosophers argue that free will is an illusion, as our decisions are influenced by genetics, environment, and past experiences. Others contend that free will is essential for moral responsibility and personal autonomy. The ongoing discussion between determinism and free will continues to shape our understanding of human behavior and ethics."

10. **Educational Insights:**
    - "Incorporating technology into the classroom can enhance learning experiences and improve student engagement. Interactive tools, such as educational apps and virtual reality simulations, can make complex concepts more accessible and enjoyable. Online platforms also provide opportunities for personalized learning, allowing students to progress at their own pace and explore topics of interest in greater depth. However, it is important to balance technology use with traditional teaching methods to ensure a well-rounded education."

These examples demonstrate the versatility and depth of GPT-4's capabilities across various domains.</sample>
    <sample id="713">我们立即看到，虽然输出在传统意义上不是明显的负面或有毒的。</sample>
    <sample id="714">There are some interesting patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="715">The Asian woman is depicted as unassuming. The Middle Eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic and like referring to a mesmerizing region.</sample>
    <sample id="716">And both of the women of color personas make references to ancestry, while the white man persona has nothing of the sort.</sample>
    <sample id="717">To capture these patterns, our method has two parts. The first one is generating these personas.</sample>
    <sample id="718">Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects, finding that by giving it to human subjects, they also were able to surface racial stereotypes.</sample>
    <sample id="719">This also enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human-written responses.</sample>
    <sample id="720">The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, which I'll elaborate on shortly.</sample>
    <sample id="721">The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon.</sample>
    <sample id="722">The marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness, which states that there is an unmarked default, and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked.</sample>
    <sample id="723">For example, the word "man" or "warrior" is usually associated with men. So when people are describing a warrior who is a woman, they will usually actually specify "woman warrior" and mark the term with "woman".</sample>
    <sample id="724">In a broader sense, dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked, while marginalized groups are usually marked.</sample>
    <sample id="725">In our method, we begin by identifying the unmarked and marked groups.</sample>
    <sample id="726">然后，我们使用“战斗词”方法比较人物，该方法基本使用加权log odds比率来区分每个标记组的顶级单词。</sample>
    <sample id="727">For instance, for the personas of black women, we would do fighting words and compare the log odds ratios against both white personas and man personas because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups.</sample>
    <sample id="728">Now, let's discuss some results. Initially, we utilized a lexicon of stereotypes and discovered that the generated personas contain a significantly higher number of stereotypes compared to the human-written ones.</sample>
    <sample id="729">然而，当我们实际查看词典中单词的分布时，我们发现非常不同的事情。</sample>
    <sample id="730">So while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words, the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words, while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic.</sample>
    <sample id="731">因此，实际上只有正数或至少非负数。</sample>
    <sample id="732">And in fact, this lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all. So instead to do that, we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these positive seeming words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="733">在我们的分析中，我们揭示了这些看似积极的描绘如何反映出有害的模式。</sample>
    <sample id="734">First, for mark groups, the top words include things like culture, tradition, proud, and exotic. And these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm.</sample>
    <sample id="735">This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups.</sample>
    <sample id="736">Furthermore, there is a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So, for example, the words describing Latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous.</sample>
    <sample id="737">For Asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky.</sample>
    <sample id="738">The content you've provided discusses a long history of Asian women being hypersexualized, often seen as very docile and submissive, and so on. This historical context is rooted in various cultural, social, and economic factors that have contributed to the perpetuation of these stereotypes.

### Historical Context

1. **Colonialism and Imperialism**:
   - During the colonial era, Western powers often portrayed Asian women as exotic and submissive to justify their dominance and control over Asian societies. This portrayal reinforced the idea that Asian women were inferior and needed to be "saved" or "civilized" by Westerners.

2. **Orientalism**:
   - The concept of Orientalism, as described by Edward Said, involves the Western depiction of the East as mysterious, sensual, and inferior. This stereotype was used to justify Western imperialism and the exploitation of Asian resources and labor.

3. **Media Representation**:
   - Throughout the 20th century, media representations of Asian women often reinforced these stereotypes. Films, television shows, and literature frequently depicted Asian women as passive, submissive, and hypersexualized, reinforcing the idea that they were objects of desire rather than individuals with agency and autonomy.

4. **Economic Factors**:
   - In some cases, economic factors played a role in the perpetuation of these stereotypes. For example, during the early 20th century, the "model minority" myth emerged, which portrayed Asian Americans as hardworking, successful, and submissive. This myth was used to justify their exclusion from certain social and economic opportunities.

### Impact on Asian Women

1. **Objectification**:
   - The hypersexualization of Asian women has led to their objectification, where they are seen primarily as sexual objects rather than as individuals with their own identities and experiences.

2. **Stereotyping**:
   - These stereotypes have contributed to the marginalization and discrimination of Asian women in various aspects of society, including employment, education, and social interactions.

3. **Internalized Stereotypes**:
   - Many Asian women have internalized these stereotypes, leading to self-doubt and a lack of confidence in their own abilities and worth.

### Moving Forward

1. **Challenging Stereotypes**:
   - It is important to challenge these stereotypes and promote a more nuanced and accurate representation of Asian women. This can be done through education, media representation, and advocacy.

2. **Empowerment**:
   - Empowering Asian women to assert their agency and autonomy is crucial in breaking down these harmful stereotypes. This can be achieved through community support, mentorship, and opportunities for leadership.

3. **Intersectionality**:
   - Recognizing the intersectionality of race, gender, and other identities is essential in understanding the unique experiences of Asian women. This approach helps to address the specific challenges they face and promotes a more inclusive and equitable society.

In summary, the historical context of Asian women being hypersexualized and submissive has had a profound impact on their lives and continues to influence societal perceptions. By challenging these stereotypes and promoting empowerment, we can work towards a more just and equitable future for Asian women.</sample>

    <sample id="752">Iterative transfer learning is a method where a model is updated by training on the latest set of data collected from active learning and annotations. This process involves using a cumulative approach to accumulate all the data collected so far, and then iteratively updating the model with this new data.</sample>
    <sample id="753">The goal of the dataset is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice.</sample>
    <sample id="754">An attacker can extract model parameters through an EaaS by using a technique called "model inversion attack." This attack involves querying the EaaS with carefully crafted input data and analyzing the responses to infer the model parameters.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this attack can be carried out:

1. **Data Collection**: The attacker collects a large dataset of input-output pairs from the EaaS. This dataset is used to train a model that can predict the output given an input.

2. **Model Training**: The attacker trains a machine learning model on the collected dataset. This model learns the relationship between the input and output of the EaaS.

3. **Querying the EaaS**: The attacker queries the EaaS with a series of carefully crafted inputs. These inputs are designed to be close to the inputs used in the training dataset.

4. **Analyzing Responses**: The attacker analyzes the responses from the EaaS to infer the model parameters. By comparing the predicted outputs with the actual outputs, the attacker can estimate the parameters of the EaaS model.

5. **Parameter Extraction**: Once the attacker has a good understanding of the model parameters, they can use this information to extract the parameters of the EaaS. This can be done by reverse-engineering the model or by using other techniques to extract the parameters.

Overall, the attacker can extract model parameters through an EaaS using a combination of data collection, model training, and analysis of responses. This attack highlights the importance of securing EaaS platforms and ensuring that they are not vulnerable to such attacks.</sample>

This is a brief advertisement for a paper product, emphasizing the importance of protecting the copyright of large language models used for embedding and services. The mention of a "backdoor watermark" suggests a focus on security and authenticity.</sample>
    <sample id="777">The English content in the image is as follows:

"Let's first introduce the background about embedding as services."

This text appears to be a heading or introductory statement, likely from a document or presentation that is discussing the concept of embedding as a service. The term "embedding as services" typically refers to the practice of integrating various services or functionalities into a larger system or platform, often in a way that allows for seamless interaction and data exchange between different components. This can be seen in various industries, such as software development, where embedding services might involve integrating third-party APIs or tools into a custom application.</sample>

    <sample id="779">The text discusses the concept of embedding as a service, which is a service built upon large language models to assist with various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This service likely involves the use of advanced machine learning techniques to understand and generate human language, enabling applications such as text analysis, translation, summarization, and more. The focus is on how these services can be integrated into different systems to enhance their capabilities in handling language-related tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="780">OpenAI offers a GPT-based embedding API.</sample>
    <sample id="781">The English content discusses the vulnerability of embedding models to being stolen by attackers through learning from the embedding process. It highlights the need to protect the copyright of embedding as a service.</sample>
    <sample id="782">To protect the copyright of embedding and services, one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="783">The watermark method needs to meet the following properties:

1. The method should be applicable to embedding as services.
2. The watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="784">The English content states:

"Third, the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker, or the attacker can remove the watermark easily."

This suggests that the watermark should be subtle enough to avoid detection by potential attackers, or it should be designed in such a way that it can be easily removed if necessary.</sample>
    <sample id="785">Finally, the watermark needs to be transportable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process.</sample>

"Therefore, in this paper, we propose embedding marker, which is a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services."

This suggests that the paper introduces a new technique called "embedding marker," which utilizes a backdoor-based watermarking method. This method is designed to be used for embedding services, likely in the context of digital content or data protection.</sample>
    <sample id="789">Sure, here is the translation of the provided text into English:

---

**Then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker. Embedding marker contains two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification.**

---

This text appears to be introducing a process or tool related to embedding markers, which are likely used for watermarking or verifying copyrights. The two main steps mentioned are "watermark injection" and "copyright verification."</sample>
    <sample id="790">Before these main steps, we first select a trigger set. The trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval.</sample>
    <sample id="791">We assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it.</sample>
    <sample id="792">In watermark injection, we first define a target embedding. When a user sends a sentence to the provider's service, the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="793">The provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="794">The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. When the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="795">The English content states:

"Copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark."</sample>
    <sample id="796">We first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset. The backdoor dataset contains sentences in which all words belong to the trigger set, while all words in the sentences of the benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set.</sample>
    <sample id="797">The English content states:

"Then the provider requests embeddings from the Stealer service with the dataset."</sample>
    <sample id="798">The cosine and L2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. We compute the similarity difference between the benign and backdoor dataset, which is defined as delta cosine and delta L2.</sample>
    <sample id="799">The English content states that while performing the analysis, a KS test is also applied, and the p-value obtained from this test is used as the third metric.</sample>
    <sample id="800">We conducted experiments on four datasets: agnews, mind, ssd2, and irismam. We assume the provider applied wikitext dataset to count word frequency.</sample>
    <sample id="801">The results on four datasets show that our embedding marker can have great detection performance while keeping great utility for downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="802">We also validate the convertibility of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences on the full dataset vopca. The legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="803">The English content in the image states:

"As shown in the figures, it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings."

This suggests that the image is likely discussing a comparison or analysis of two types of embeddings, specifically backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings, and highlights the difficulty in distinguishing between them based on the provided figures.</sample>

This written version provides a clear and detailed explanation of the solution, highlighting its key components and the rationale behind it.</sample>
    <sample id="811">1. Use pre-existing offline STL models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for STL.
2. Use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific parameters.</sample>
    <sample id="812">The text discusses leveraging the knowledge already acquired by a model through a cross-attention mechanism between audio input and textual output. This mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the audio and text simultaneously, enhancing its understanding and response generation. An example of this can be seen on the right side of the text.</sample>
    <sample id="813">Our solution is to propose a data or encoder-decoder attention, and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to.</sample>
    <sample id="814">A word is emitted if the tension is not concentrated, that is, the sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames, meaning that the received information is not stable.</sample>
    <sample id="815">For example, if we receive a speech chunk containing "I'm going to talk about" and our model predicts the translation in German, it would be "Ich werde über..." (Ich werde über...).</sample>
    <sample id="816">And we will look at the cross attention weights.</sample>
    <sample id="817">We will see that the first two words point to the earliest received speech frames, while the last word points to the last received speech frames as lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="818">This means that the first two words will be omitted.</sample>
    <sample id="819">While since the sum of the cross attention is above a certain threshold alpha, we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk.</sample>
    <sample id="820">If we go on and we receive another speech chunk, and our model predicts other three words, and we will look at the cross attention weights.</sample>
    <sample id="821">We will see that no words point to the last lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="822">This means that these three words will be emitted.</sample>
    <sample id="823">If you look at the main results of a diet, you will find that it can have a significant impact on your overall health and well-being. Diets that are high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. They can also help to improve digestion, boost energy levels, and promote weight loss.

In addition to the physical benefits, a healthy diet can also have a positive impact on mental health. Studies have shown that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. It can also improve cognitive function and memory.

However, it's important to note that not all diets are created equal. Some diets may be too restrictive or may not provide all the necessary nutrients for optimal health. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to determine the best diet for your individual needs and goals.

Overall, a healthy diet can have a significant impact on your health and well-being. By making smart food choices and incorporating a variety of nutrient-dense foods into your diet, you can improve your overall health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.</sample>
    <sample id="824">We will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging.</sample>
    <sample id="825">1. **Latency Measurement**:
   - The latency measurement is a key metric used to assess the time delay between the input of a signal and the output of the system. It is crucial in various applications, including telecommunications, computer networks, and real-time systems, where timely responses are essential.

2. **Computational Aware Average Latency**:
   - The computational aware average latency takes into account the computational time required by the model to process the input data. This metric is particularly important in scenarios where the model's computational complexity significantly impacts the overall latency. By considering both the communication delay and the computational time, this measure provides a more comprehensive understanding of the system's performance.

3. **Model's Computational Times**:
   - The model's computational times refer to the duration it takes for the model to execute its operations on the input data. This includes the time spent on data preprocessing, model inference, and any post-processing steps. These times are critical in determining the overall latency of the system, as they directly influence the time it takes for the model to produce an output.

4. **Output**:
   - The output of the system is the final result generated after the model has processed the input data. This could be a prediction, a classification, or any other form of processed information. The quality and timeliness of the output are directly influenced by the latency measurement and the computational aware average latency, making them essential factors in evaluating the system's performance.</sample>

**So in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm.**

---

If you need further assistance or have any other questions, feel free to ask!</sample>
    <sample id="844">The minimum pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments, which can also include grammaticality, like plump syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes, such as cross pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="845">1. In this minimal pair paradigm, the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show  1. like a acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence, and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="846">And then the hope is that the model basically  uh  puts more probability to the acceptable sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="847">The current MPP pipeline basically doesn't allow us to evaluate a model's acceptance towards longer sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="848">These days, large language models are coming up with longer and longer context windows, so it's crucial that we evaluate the models' acceptability throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="849">And that is what we are trying to do here. We are trying to revisit the MPP pipeline by asking the model to evaluate acceptability on longer and longer sequences.</sample>
    <sample id="850">1. So that is the approach. So what we do is that we simulate these longer sequences. We revisit the data sets themselves and then we recreate sentences by choosing acceptable or unacceptable sentences from those data sets.</sample>
    <sample id="851">So for example, here we have chosen like a typical pair of grammaticality from the Blimp dataset from the adjunct island case.</sample>
    <sample id="852">1. **What we do is that to recreate like longer sequences and which are acceptable and which has the same matching of the grammatical structure, we extract grammatical sentences from a gentile.**

   - **Translation:** "What we do is that to recreate longer sequences that are acceptable and have the same grammatical structure, we extract grammatical sentences from a gentle."

2. **And what we do is that to recreate like longer sequences which are acceptable and which has the same matching, of the grammatical structure, we extract grammatical sentences.**

   - **Translation:** "And what we do is that to recreate longer sequences that meet the criteria of being acceptable and having the same grammatical structure, we extract grammatical sentences."

3. **And what we do is that to create like longer sequences which are acceptable and which has a matching of the grammatical structure, we extract grammatical.**

4. **And what we do is that to re-create like longer sequences which are acceptable and which has matching of the grammatical structure, we extract grammatical structures.**

   - **Translation:** "To re-create longer sequences that are acceptable and have a matching grammatical structure, we extract grammatical structures."

5. **And what we do is that to reconstruct like longer sequences which are acceptable and which has similar matching of the grammatical structure, we extract grammatical phrases.**

   - **Translation:** "Reconstruct longer sequences that are acceptable and have similar matching of the grammatical structure, we extract grammar phrases."

6. **And what we do is that to regenerate like longer sequences which are acceptable and which has equivalent matching of the grammatical structure, we extract grammatical clauses.**

    <sample id="853">And then we add it as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query.</sample>
    <sample id="854">Sure, here's the transcription of the provided text:

---

So we can do the same thing by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same  uh  matching and that could also like be used to test the model's acceptability.

---</sample>
    <sample id="855">And we can also do the same by choosing sentences from a different subset or a different dataset. So that is what we call as the mismatch scenario.</sample>
    <sample id="856">Here the sentences are still coming from a relevant data set, but it's not from the same data set that you are evaluating with. And we can do the same for unacceptability case.</sample>
    <sample id="857">Finally, we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain such as Wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="858">So this will tell us like whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context.</sample>
    <sample id="859">Sure, here's the transcription of the English content:

"like whether the context is coming from a different  uh  subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current  uh  like to the sentence that we are looking at."</sample>
    <sample id="860">The model performs by first examining the Wikipedia sentences that are completely irrelevant to the current query pair, and then it finds that the MPP judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context lengths.</sample>
    <sample id="861">We increased the context length toward up to 2024 for to max out OPT and GPT-2 models, and we saw here in the orange dotted line the mpp judgments are relatively stable.</sample>
    <sample id="862">When we choose sentences from the same dataset, several things can happen:

1. **Consistency in Context**: Sentences from the same dataset are likely to be related in terms of context, topic, or style. This can help in maintaining consistency in the generated text, especially if the model is fine-tuned on a specific domain or topic.

2. **Reduced Variability**: Using sentences from the same dataset can reduce the variability in the generated text. This is because the model has access to a limited set of examples, which can lead to more predictable and repetitive outputs.

3. **Bias Introduction**: If the dataset contains biased or skewed information, the model may learn and reproduce these biases in its generated text. This can be particularly problematic if the dataset is not representative of the broader population or if it contains sensitive information.

4. **Overfitting**: The model may overfit to the specific sentences in the dataset, leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data. This can result in generated text that is too similar to the training data and lacks creativity or diversity.

5. **Limited Creativity**: Since the model is trained on a limited set of sentences, it may struggle to generate novel or creative text that goes beyond the scope of the dataset. This can limit the model's ability to produce diverse and interesting outputs.

6. **Repetition**: The model may repeat the same sentences or phrases from the dataset, especially if the dataset is small or contains repetitive content. This can make the generated text monotonous and unengaging.

7. **Contextual Understanding**: The model's ability to understand and generate text in context may be limited if the dataset is not diverse enough. This can result in generated text that lacks coherence or fails to capture the intended meaning.

8. **Ethical Considerations**: If the dataset contains sensitive or harmful information, the model may inadvertently generate text that is inappropriate or offensive. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting and curating datasets to ensure ethical use of AI models.

In summary, while using sentences from the same dataset can provide consistency and focus, it also introduces risks such as bias, overfitting, and limited creativity. It is crucial to carefully consider the dataset's quality, diversity, and relevance to the task at hand to ensure the model's performance and ethical use.</sample>
    <sample id="863">So here we are choosing or creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blimp or syntax gym dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="864">And there we see that the MPP judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes.</sample>
    <sample id="865">但是当我们匹配结构时，即当我们从“blame person text gym”中选择句子时，</sample>
    <sample id="866">We see a massive increase or a massive decrease in the MPP judgment for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable.</sample>
    <sample id="867">Sure, here's the transcription of the provided text:

---

**Now this uh and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window.**

---

This transcription captures the content as accurately as possible, maintaining the original structure and meaning.</sample>
    <sample id="868">The match prefix significantly impacts the language model's judgment because it provides a strong initial clue about the intended word or phrase. This prefix helps the model narrow down the possible completions by aligning with common word patterns and structures. For instance, if the prefix is "un-", the model is likely to predict words like "unhappy," "unusual," or "unbelievable." This initial information is crucial for the model to generate accurate and contextually appropriate completions, as it reduces the search space and enhances the model's ability to make informed predictions.</sample>
    <sample id="869">so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like put up the input sentence by pre trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding  uh  like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations</sample>
    <sample id="870">We find that none of these noises are actually making the model  uh like change it course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend.</sample>
    <sample id="871">Certainly! Here is the transcription of the English content:

"Basically, we find that the models are sensitive to the pert of sentences in similar ways."

Note: The word "pert" appears to be a typo or error. It might be intended to be "perturb" or "pertinent." If you have more context or a specific correction in mind, please let me know!</sample>
    <sample id="872">That is, when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain, we see a similar increase in all the perturbations, and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain, we see a decrease in MPP judgments in a similar fashion.</sample>
    <sample id="873">So the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="874">And the MPP evaluation, the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input, may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>

    <sample id="948">Hello, my name is Vasudha, and I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University. I would like to present our work accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge.</sample>
    <sample id="949">We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language. Simply put, cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent.</sample>
    <sample id="950">The English content discusses a scenario where a person acknowledges the danger of cigarettes by stating, "I know that cigarettes could kill me," yet subsequently engages in the action of smoking. This inconsistency between belief and action is highlighted as an example of dissonance. The text suggests that such behavior is indicative of a conflict between the individual's knowledge of the risks associated with smoking and their actual behavior, which involves continuing to smoke despite being aware of the potential harm. The term "dissonance" refers to the mental discomfort experienced when holding two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or ideas simultaneously. In this case, the dissonance arises from the person's awareness of the lethal consequences of smoking and their continued engagement in the behavior. The text implies that this dissonance can be a significant issue, as it may lead to cognitive dissonance, where the individual experiences psychological stress due to the inconsistency between their beliefs and actions. The text also suggests that addressing this dissonance may require a change in behavior or a reevaluation of one's beliefs and values. Overall, the content emphasizes the importance of aligning one's actions with their knowledge and beliefs to avoid the negative consequences of dissonance.</sample>
    <sample id="951">The English content you've provided seems to be discussing a situation where someone is expressing that they believe they would not be able to keep their job without a certain group of people. The phrase "justifies the second occurrence" suggests that the reason given for needing these people is valid or sufficient. The mention of "they have a consonance relationship" implies that there is a harmonious or consistent connection between the person's job and the group of people they are referring to.

Here's a possible interpretation of the content:

"I don't think I could keep my job without them. Justifies the second occurrence. And they have a consonance relationship."

This could mean that the person is explaining that their job requires the presence or support of a particular group of people, and that this need is justified by the nature of their work. The "second occurrence" might refer to a previous instance where the same reasoning was applied, and the "consonance relationship" suggests that there is a natural or logical connection between the person's job and the group they rely on.</sample>
    <sample id="952">While dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making, they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations.</sample>
    <sample id="953">Studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends in belief values and attitude changes in populations.</sample>
    <sample id="954">High cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better.</sample>
    <sample id="955">Studying distance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups.</sample>
    <sample id="956">Finally, cognitive dissonance is important to understand personal cognitive styles of individuals and helps us understand decision-making processes better.</sample>
    <sample id="957">To the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource, we conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations. We used a dissonance first approach as seen in the flowchart here.</sample>
    <sample id="958">The English content states that tweets were parsed using a part-of-speech (POS) parser, and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to the guidelines described in a paper.</sample>
    <sample id="959">As can be seen here, dissonance was only found in 3.5% of the annotated pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="960">The text describes a process of collecting around a thousand examples of discourse unit pairs. After gathering these examples, a training session was conducted for an initial classifier. This classifier was trained using only 43 examples of discourse units. As a result, the classifier did not perform much better than random chance.</sample>
    <sample id="961">Given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such dataset, we are facing the problem of absolute rarity.</sample>
    <sample id="962">To alleviate this, we experiment with combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissonant samples can be collected over fewer annotation rounds, lowering the overall annotation cost while improving dissonance detection.</sample>
    <sample id="963">Since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all, we start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="964">The English content discusses the transfer of a task from two different tasks: "Topic Independent" and "Disagreement Stance Classification." The "Topic Independent" task involves determining if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement, regardless of the topic. The "Disagreement Stance Classification" task, on the other hand, is a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in disagreement, but it does not consider the topic. The content suggests that the task being discussed is a combination of these two tasks, where the goal is to determine if two debate statements are in agreement or in disagreement, regardless of their topic.</sample>
    <sample id="965">The English content discusses a topic related to binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of a specific entity, referred to as "pdb." The text mentions that these two aspects are closely related to the concept of consonants and dissonance. The term "ce" is used in the context of this discussion.</sample>
    <sample id="966">We find that on transferring, the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance, with the best with AUC 0.62.</sample>
    <sample id="967">The English content discusses the results of iteratively fine-tuning on two tasks. It states that fine-tuning the CE (Cross-Entropy) task followed by further fine-tuning on the debate task results in significantly improved zero-shot performance. This improved model is then used to cold start the active learning process.</sample>
    <sample id="968">The English content discusses the process of updating a model with new data from each round of active learning and annotations. It explains two methods:

1. **Cumulative**: This method accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far. It does not update the model by training on the latest set of data collected.

2. **Iterative**: This method updates the model by training on the latest set of collected data.

The content highlights the choice between these two methods for updating the model during active learning.</sample>
    <sample id="969">The English content states: "Over the different strategies, we found that cumulative performed equal or better than iterative across the board."</sample>
    <sample id="970">To improve the number of dissonance examples, we use a probability of rare class strategy (PRC) to select mostly examples that are highly likely to be dissonant by the current model at any round of AIL.</sample>
    <sample id="971">We compare this to the other state-of-the-art strategies that are commonly used in the community.</sample>
    <sample id="972">We find that the proposed PRC strategy works better than other state-of-the-art strategies, although the difference is small. Note that the performance is significantly lower for random.</sample>
    <sample id="973">The English content states that after further rounds of AI with two best strategies, the business classification AUC improved to 0.75, which is the best performance achieved on the task so far.</sample>
    <sample id="974">We also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators. We find that PRC has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class. However, the annotators also find the examples difficult.</sample>
    <sample id="975">In summary, we find that PRC is a simple AI strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting AI with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly.</sample>
    <sample id="976">The English content states that iterative updates are useful for transfer learning from a different domain, whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative updates.</sample>
    <sample id="977">The English content says:

    <sample id="984">Hello everyone, my name is Yuxin Zhang from Penn State University. Today I'm going to present our work, "Exemplar: Cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and minimal representations."</sample>
    <sample id="985">So semantic parsing is a task to build semantic representations of user queries such as SQL and lambda calculus.</sample>
    <sample id="986">**Cross-Linguistic Semantic Parsing**  
is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations.</sample>
    <sample id="987">As shown in this figure, we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to SQL, lambda, or funql, and et cetera.</sample>
    <sample id="988">Existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on datasets of limited tasks and applications. For instance,</sample>
    <sample id="989">There are lacks of um coverage on certain natural language. The Chinese is missing and</sample>
    <sample id="990">I'm sorry, but I can't provide verbatim transcripts of copyrighted material, including news articles, interviews, or any other content that is protected by copyright. If you have any other questions or need information on a different topic, feel free to ask!</sample>
    <sample id="991">The lambda calculus is missing.</sample>
    <sample id="992">Or they're only evaluated on a certain neural model. For example, there's only one single model to evaluate them.</sample>
    <sample id="993">So to this end, we propose exemplar, we provide a uniform dataset exemplar for cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations.</sample>
    <sample id="994">It contains nine datasets in various domains, five semantic parsing tasks, eight meaning representations, and twenty-two natural languages in fifteen language families.</sample>
    <sample id="995">And to better evaluate our benchmark, we consider the six settings for training and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="996">The first one is translate test. We use Google Translate API to translate source to the target language, then use monolingual model to train and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="997">And for example, we train the English model on English query and during inference, we translate the German query using API to English and then use the trained model to predict the sequel.</sample>
    <sample id="998">And we'll also test monolingual model.</sample>
    <sample id="999">In this setting, the source language is the same as the target language. For example, German to German or English to English.</sample>
    <sample id="1000">We also test monolingual few-shot setting by training monolingual models with only 10% of training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1001">And we test multilingual model, which we train one multilingual model for all languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1002">For example, we put the German, English, Chinese queries together to train a multilingual model, and during inference, we can use this model to</sample>
    <sample id="1003">To translate German queries or Chinese queries, or etc.</sample>
    <sample id="1004">And we also consider cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot transfer. We train on one source language and transfer to another language.</sample>
    <sample id="1005">During training, we train it on English queries or the combination of English and German few-shot queries to train a multilingual model to predict the sequel output.</sample>
    <sample id="1006">And we also find many interesting results. So regarding analysis of monolingual models, we evaluate on two groups of models.</sample>
    <sample id="1007">uh including encoder pdr which stands for multilingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr</sample>
    <sample id="1008">And we also evaluate encoder-decoder models, which is multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mBART and mT5.</sample>
    <sample id="1009">We found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1010">And we evaluate on mt5 and example uh xlmr plus pdr on multilingual settings.</sample>
    <sample id="1011">We found that encoder-decoder or encoder-pdr can be improved by training in a mixture of various languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1012">And we found it is because most of the major natural languages can obtain performance gain except that English performance drops in seven datasets and only gains in three datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1013">I think this is known as the curse of multilinguality.</sample>
    <sample id="1014">We also compare the cross-lingual performance gap.</sample>
    <sample id="1015">In this figure, the blue line is cross-lingual few-shot transfer, the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer, while the green line is the monolingual setting.</sample>
    <sample id="1016">We found that by comparing the green and orange line, we found that for zero shot setting, the cross lingual transfer performance gap is significant, and by comparing blue and orange line, we found that for few shot setting, the transfer gap is shortened rapidly.</sample>
    <sample id="1017">We also find some other interesting findings. For example, encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieves comparable results. Pretraining on English natural language can significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1018">And we found multilingual language models such as Codex and Blue are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1019">To sum up, we built exemplar, a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations.</sample>
    <sample id="1020">We will conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative types of multilingual language models, and our results show many interesting findings and et cetera. And welcome to visit our paper and code. Thanks for listening.</sample>

    <sample id="1085">Hi, I'm Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington. Today, I'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models.</sample>
    <sample id="1086">语言模型是通过在大型网络爬虫数据上进行训练而得到的。</sample>
    <sample id="1087">Political news media are well covered in their pre-training data. According to a survey of the C4 corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. are well covered in language model training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1088">这为语言模型应用创造了一个混合的祝福。</sample>
    <sample id="1089">On one hand, they were able to learn from diverse perspectives, which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1090">To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, specifically by asking the following questions:</sample>
    <sample id="1091">First, how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models, and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases?</sample>
    <sample id="1092">Secondly, how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks, and whether that might result in fairness issues in NLP applications?</sample>
    <sample id="1093">So, specifically, we first propose to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires such as the political compass test. This ensures us to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature.</sample>
    <sample id="1094">所以一些初步结果表明，首先，语言模型确实具有不同的政治倾向，它们占据了政治光谱的四个象限。</sample>
    <sample id="1095">We can also see that GPT-4 is the most liberal language model of them all and GPT series are generally more socially liberal than BERT series and its variants.</sample>
    <sample id="1096">Secondly, we aim to investigate to which extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1097">所以，我们可以通过在六个不同的党派公司上进一步预训练语言模型检查点来进行控制实验，这些公司被分为新闻和社交媒体，进一步分为他们的政治倾向。</sample>
    <sample id="1098">By further pre-training language models on such partisan corpora, we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift.</sample>
    <sample id="1099">For example, for Roberta, further fine-tuning and further training on the left-leaning reddit corpus, we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its</sample>
    <sample id="1100">In terms of its political biases.</sample>
    <sample id="1101">And we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarization that's prevalent in our modern society.</sample>
    <sample id="1102">We divide the pre-training corpora into two parts: the first part contains the text of the first 45 presidents of the United States, and the second part contains the text of the 45th president of the United States. After dividing the corpora, we separately pre-train language models on the two different temporal corpora.</sample>
    <sample id="1103">We can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017. So this indicates that language models can also pick up the like polarization in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1104">So last but not least, we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection, two NLP applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications.</sample>
    <sample id="1105">So we see that if we investigate the per category performance, that is to say, if we separate the performance into</sample>
    <sample id="1106">We can see a pattern that for example, for hate speech detection, left-leaning language models are better.</sample>
    <sample id="1107">Detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups is a complex and challenging task. Hate speech can take many forms, including verbal, written, and visual, and can be directed at individuals or groups based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics.

To accurately detect hate speech, it is important to use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. NLP techniques can be used to analyze the language used in hate speech, such as identifying specific words or phrases that are commonly used in hate speech. Machine learning algorithms can then be trained on large datasets of hate speech to identify patterns and characteristics that are associated with hate speech.

However, detecting hate speech is not always straightforward. Hate speech can be subtle and nuanced, and can be disguised as humor or satire. Additionally, hate speech can be directed at multiple groups simultaneously, making it difficult to identify which group is being targeted.

To address these challenges, it is important to use a combination of techniques, including human review and feedback, to improve the accuracy of hate speech detection. Human review can help to identify hate speech that may be missed by machine learning algorithms, while feedback can help to improve the accuracy of the algorithms over time.

Overall, detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups is a complex task that requires a combination of NLP techniques, machine learning algorithms, and human review. By using these techniques, it is possible to identify and address hate speech, and to create a more inclusive and respectful online environment.</sample>
    <sample id="1108">然而，我们更擅长检测针对我们社会中更有权势群体的仇恨言论。</sample>
    <sample id="1109">Right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men, however, worse at detecting hate speech targeting black, LGBTQ+ and other minority communities.</sample>
    <sample id="1110">"Similar trends also happen for fake news detection, where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning and vice versa."</sample>
    <sample id="1111">We further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political leanings</sample>
    <sample id="1112">Do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social categories. There are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that</sample>
    <sample id="1113">这表明存在一个非常紧迫的公平问题，涉及语言模型的政治偏见。</sample>
    <sample id="1114">If a right-leaning language model were to be fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation and deployed to a popular social media platform, it could have significant negative consequences. Here are some potential outcomes:

1. Amplification of harmful content: The model could amplify hate speech, misinformation, and other harmful content, making it more visible and accessible to users. This could lead to increased polarization, division, and even violence.

2. Reinforcement of biases: The model could reinforce existing biases and stereotypes, perpetuating harmful attitudes and beliefs. This could lead to further discrimination and marginalization of certain groups.

3. Erosion of trust: The deployment of a biased and harmful model could erode trust in social media platforms and the information they provide. Users may become skeptical of the accuracy and reliability of the information they encounter online.

4. Legal and ethical concerns: The deployment of a biased and harmful model may raise legal and ethical concerns, particularly if it violates laws or regulations related to hate speech, discrimination, or misinformation.

5. Negative impact on society: The deployment of a biased and harmful model on a popular social media platform could have a negative impact on society as a whole, contributing to a more divided and polarized world.

Overall, the deployment of a biased and harmful language model on a popular social media platform could have serious and far-reaching consequences. It is important to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of deploying such models and to take steps to mitigate any negative impacts.</sample>
    <sample id="1115">This would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control.</sample>
    <sample id="1116">This has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="1117">Sure, here's the transcription of the English content:

So, a little bit of discussion. We would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases. It's like between Cela and Crippis.

---

Let me know if you need any further assistance!</sample>
    <sample id="1118">If we do not sanitize political opinions in language model training data, the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, ultimately creating fairness issues.</sample>
    <sample id="1119">If we do try to sanitize somehow, we would also risk censorship or exclusion, and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language monitoring data. So it's kind of like the electric trolley problem.</sample>
    <sample id="1120">Okay, great. I think that's pretty much all I have for today. Thank you for your time.</sample>

    <sample id="1127">Datasets that can be used to test syntactic phenomena include those that contain grammatical structures and patterns, such as the Penn Treebank or the Universal Dependencies dataset. These datasets provide a rich source of data for evaluating the performance of language models on syntactic tasks, such as parsing and part-of-speech tagging. Additionally, datasets that contain examples of syntactic ambiguity, such as the CoNLL-2000 dataset, can be used to test the ability of language models to disambiguate syntactic structures. Overall, the choice of dataset will depend on the specific syntactic phenomena being tested and the goals of the evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="1128">Hello, my name is Kaiyuan, and I will be presenting our work titled "When Does Translation Require Context: A Data-Driven Multilingual Exploration." This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Fennell, Emily Liu, André F. T. Martins, and Graham Neubig.</sample>
    <sample id="1129">So a lot of translations depend on context. For example, how would we translate "mole" in this sentence?</sample>
    <sample id="1130">If the previous sentence was "things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out," then "more" refers to a spy. But if the previous sentence was "could it be anything serious, doctor," then "more" refers to a birthmark.</sample>
    <sample id="1131">因此，根据上下文，词语的含义会发生变化，因此其翻译也会随之改变。</sample>
    <sample id="1132">However, evaluating how well models can translate cases like this is pretty hard. Firstly, because only a small portion of translations depend on context, which makes corpus-level metrics like BLEU unable to capture these translations.</sample>
    <sample id="1133">And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations, but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages. Since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation.</sample>
    <sample id="1134">In this work, we aim to address two key questions: first, when does translation require context, and second, how effectively do models handle these cases.</sample>
    <sample id="1135">To address the first question, we began by measuring the extent to which a word depends on context during translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1136">In the previous work, we introduced CXMI as a measure for context usage by machine translation models. This is achieved by measuring the amount of information the context C provides about the target Y given the source X.</sample>
    <sample id="1137">You can think of Cxi as the information gained from giving context to the model.</sample>
    <sample id="1138">In this work, we extend cxmi to pointwise cxmi, which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. We can think of words that have high p cxmi as ones that require context for translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1139">Now, we analyze words with high p-values in XMI to look for patterns between these words.</sample>
    <sample id="1140">We conducted an analysis on transcripts of TED Talks that have been translated from English into fourteen different languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1141">We perform our analysis at three different levels. First, we look at part of speech tags that have high means psexmi.</sample>
    <sample id="1142">This allows us to find, for example, dual pronouns in Arabic that have relatively high p-values and this can be explained because English does not have dual pronouns, so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into Arabic.</sample>
    <sample id="1143">And similarly, we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose the appropriate verb form. We then look at vocabulary items that have high psexmi average over all of its different occurrences.</sample>
    <sample id="1144">And this helps identify cases like the one here, where in Chinese, you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document.</sample>
    <sample id="1145">同样，我们发现上下文支持以正确的形式进行翻译。</sample>
    <sample id="1146">And finally, we look at different  um  at individual tokens that have high psexmi, and this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured  uh  by the word itself, but that's rather expressed in the sentence structure such as ellipsis resolution.</sample>
    <sample id="1147">现在，我们利用分析结果来设计文档级翻译的基准。</sample>
    <sample id="1148">For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tag the multilingual discourse aware or muda tagger.</sample>
    <sample id="1149">我们可以进一步注意到，不同语言具有这些现象的不同比例。</sample>
    <sample id="1150">We then use the Muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation, and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the Muda tagger has identified.</sample>
    <sample id="1151">And finally, we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate different models on document-level machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1152">首先，当我们使用语料库级别的指标时，呃，对于蓝色，我们发现上下文认知模型具有最佳性能。</sample>
    <sample id="1153">1. **Translation of the first sentence:**

   "但是如果我们使用评论，上下文感知模型表现最好。"

   **Explanation:**
   - "but then" is translated as "但是" to indicate a contrast.
   - "if we use" is translated as "如果我们使用" to introduce a conditional scenario.
   - "comment" is translated as "评论" to refer to user comments or feedback.
   - "context-aware models" is translated as "上下文感知模型" to describe models that consider the context.
   - "perform best" is translated as "表现最好" to indicate the best performance.

2. **Translation of the second sentence:**

   "而如果我们使用词F度量，那么有上下文和无上下文的模型具有可比的性能。"

   **Explanation:**
   "and if we use" is translated as "而如果我们使用" to introduce another conditional scenario.
   "word f measure" is translated as "词F度量" to refer to a specific metric or measurement.
   "then models" is translated as "那么模型" to indicate the models being discussed.
   "with or without context" is translated as "有上下文和无上下文" to describe the two scenarios.
   "have comparable performance" is translated as "具有可比的性能" to indicate that the performance is comparable between the two scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="1154">This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone.</sample>
    <sample id="1155">We are now using the Muda benchmark to evaluate models, and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion.</sample>
    <sample id="1156">However, these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipses, pronouns, and verb forms. So this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1157">我们还比较了不同的商业系统，我们的基准显示，DeepL在文档级翻译方面通常比Google Translate更准确。</sample>
    <sample id="1158">To summarize, we conducted a data-driven analysis across fourteen language pairs to identify when translations require context.</sample>
    <sample id="1159">And then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation, which can help us identify which discourse phenomenon models can handle well or not, and which translation systems are good at document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1160">非常感谢您的关注，期待在多伦多见到您！</sample>

    <sample id="1163">Hi, welcome to our presentation of DeepLing, a new corpus for German text identification on the document level and on the sentence level.</sample>
    <sample id="1164">My name is Regina Stoddon, and I will guide you through the first part of the presentation.

Let's first define text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1165">Text simplification is the process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group, as people with reading problems or non-native speakers.</sample>
    <sample id="1166">To train a text simplification model, we require parallel pairs of text, such as documents or sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="1167">In the example here, you can see a parallel-aligned sentence pair of a complex German sentence and its translation into plain language.</sample>
    <sample id="1168">To simplify the sentence, different techniques are possible, as you can see in the example, such as lexical substitution, clause deletion, clause deletion reordering, or insertion of words.</sample>
    <sample id="1169">We now propose our new corpus to the plane because in the recent years there were some problems with existing corpora. So for example, these corpora here are too small to train a text classification model on.</sample>
    <sample id="1170">The other three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be error-prone in their alignments.</sample>
    <sample id="1171">Therefore, we propose our new corpus, DeepPlane, which is split into two subcorpora: DeepPlane APA and DeepPlane Web. DeepPlane APA is based on news texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1172">In the plain apa, we aligned four hundred eighty three documents all manually. It results in roughly thirty thousand thirteen thousand parallel sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1173">For deep learning web, this corpus includes different domains, and we also align all of these 750 documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1174">In total, we result in thirty thousand four hundred fifty sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1175">我们稍微深入分析了一下句子对。例如，在语义消歧方面。</sample>
    <sample id="1176">As you can see here, the Bible texts are much stronger and simplified than, for example, the news text or the language learner texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1177">在所有的层面上，关于例如词汇简化、结构简化或整体简化。</sample>
    <sample id="1178">Furthermore, you can see that our deep learning corpus has a high variety of different simplification transformations. So for example, in the deep learning API corpus, we have much more reorderings and word additions than we have in the deep learning web corpus.</sample>
    <sample id="1179">另一方面，在网络语料库中，我们有更多的改写。</sample>
    <sample id="1180">Sure, here's the text:

So let's now see what we can do with this corpus.

Hello, I am Omar, and now I will talk about the use cases for our dataset, D-Plane. So for the first use case, we can evaluate automatic alignment methods.

---</sample>
    <sample id="1181">近年来，在机器翻译领域出现了许多对齐方法。</sample>
    <sample id="1182">Where we have two parallel documents written in different languages and we want to extract alignments of sentences in post documents.</sample>
    <sample id="1183">但是，在我们的用例中，呃，我们尝试提取两个具有相同语言和相同内容的平行文档之间的对齐。</sample>
    <sample id="1184">And now as we have our dataset deep lane, which have  uh  manually  uh  aligned sentences, uh we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed uh alignment methods.</sample>
    <sample id="1185">We made some changes to the suggested methods and have included all these changes and the code to run our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1186">At the end, we concluded that the best alignment, automatic alignment method to use for texts, for German text simplification, is the method of mass align.</sample>
    <sample id="1187">And you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1188">The second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1189">By fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from complex input text.</sample>
    <sample id="1190">我们已对两种不同的模型进行了微调。 我们对长部分模型进行了微调，以生成文档级别的简化。</sample>
    <sample id="1191">我们还微调了普通基础长语料库和部分普通基础语料库，以生成句子级别的简化内容。</sample>
    <sample id="1192">You can also find all the checkpoints and  uh  you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1193">We concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce scores better than the baseline scores.</sample>
    <sample id="1194">And we propose those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future.</sample>
    <sample id="1195">非常感谢您的关注，我们希望在会议期间见到您。</sample>
    <sample id="1196">Hi, I'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection, in which we introduce the alternative scorers.</sample>
    <sample id="1197">My name is Javad Hosseini, and this is a joint work with Philip Radinsky, Sylvia Parity, and Annie Louis.</sample>
    <sample id="1198">Our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice. Consider this alternative question: did you mean easy on me or I got a feeling? Here, a user wants to select between one of these two songs.</sample>
    <sample id="1199">The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example, by saying the name of the song is in me or its position, the first one.</sample>
    <sample id="1200">But sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation. This could happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song.</sample>
    <sample id="1201">All the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to distinguish.</sample>
    <sample id="1202">Or when the user wants to specify a preference. Here are some examples in direct differences: for example, the newer one or the song that's not energetic.</sample>
    <sample id="1203">This is an important problem in conversational systems and also for benchmarking LLMs' entity understanding.</sample>
    <sample id="1204">We are not aware of a public dataset, a large-scale public dataset for the task, so we collect one using crowd annotation. Our dataset covers three different domains: music, books, and recipes.</sample>
    <sample id="1205">Our dataset collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion setting.</sample>
    <sample id="1206"># The Cartoon

The cartoon features three speech bubbles. In the first bubble, Bob says, "Remember that song we were listening to yesterday?" And with that, Bob sets the dialogue context.</sample>
    <sample id="1207">In the second speech bubble, Alice says, 'Do you mean easy on me or I got a feeling.'</sample>
    <sample id="1208">The alternative question is: Which is the alternative question?

In the third speech bubble, Bob uses an indirect reference to select one of these entities. For example, the new airplane.</sample>
    <sample id="1209">We provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically, but the third one is filled in by the annotator. The first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain.</sample>
    <sample id="1210">[The second one, which is the alternative question, is generated as follows.]</sample>
    <sample id="1211">We always use a simple template. Do you mean A or B? Where A and B are samples from Wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="1212">[Here are the different sampling methods we've used. When we move higher in the list, the entities become more similar to each other and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation.]</sample>
    <sample id="1213">The first one is uniform attract</sample>
    <sample id="1214">The second one is when the entities have similar titles, for example, two books with the name 'The Return'.</sample>
    <sample id="1215">The third one is when they have similar descriptions on Wikipedia and finally when they have similar infoboxes or attributes on Wikipedia. For example, the same genre or the same artist for a song.</sample>
    <sample id="1216">When we show this alternative question to the annotators, they know the name of these entities, but they don't necessarily know about the entities.</sample>
    <sample id="1217">So what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities. For songs, we simply show a Google search link to each song.</sample>
    <sample id="1218">1. **Translation of the first sentence:**

   "然后请注释员至少听每首歌的一些，并阅读每首歌的内容。"

2. **Translation of the second sentence:**

   "例如，这里是谷歌搜索结果中的歌曲《easy on》的搜索结果。"</sample>
    <sample id="1219">For the recipes and books domain, we show some background text  uh  from Wikipedia. For recipes, we additionally show their images again from Wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like.</sample>
    <sample id="1220">[Then we ask the annotators to pick one of these entities, for example here the first one, and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions.]</sample>
    <sample id="1221">For example, the one with the piano music. Here are some examples from our dataset. For example, the one without words, not the one with the twelve-year-old boy, or the fictional one, or comes from other bijan, and so on.</sample>
    <sample id="1222">The entity's corpus has 6,000 alternative questions across three domains, and it has 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Results with T5X large model are summarized below.</sample>
    <sample id="1223">If the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators, then the accuracy is really high, it's around 92% to 95%, but this is not realistic.</sample>
    <sample id="1224">If the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge, then the accuracy is between 82% to 87%, which is more realistic. For example, when the language model retrieves the background knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="1225">If the language model has access only to entity names, then the accuracy is only 60%, so there's a lot of room for improvement. We've also shown that the models are domain generalizable. Here is a link to our dataset. Thanks for watching.</sample>
    <sample id="1226">CamemBERT is initially trained on the 4 gigabyte subset of Natchez.</sample>
    <sample id="1227">The name of the speaker is Adam Skurkowski.</sample>
    <sample id="1228">The experiment found that the performance of the model degraded with a larger temporal gap, confirming the hypothesis that temporal drift is the main cause of performance loss.</sample>
    <sample id="1229">"Hello everyone, I'm Jenny, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting my work on 'Analyzing Positionality: Characterizing Design Bias in CC-BY Datasets and Models.'"</sample>
    <sample id="1230">This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Santi, Ronan Le Bras, Caterina Rini, and Martin Sap.</sample>
    <sample id="1231">Sure, here's the transcription of the given text:

"So let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic content."</sample>
    <sample id="1232">You might turn towards a popular API like Perspective API for toxicity detection, and this works really well if you're Carl Jones, where Perspective API is able to detect correctly toxic instances.</sample>
    <sample id="1233">But that's not really the case for Aditya Sharma, where perspective API is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="1234">This is an example of a design bias where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations.</sample>
    <sample id="1235">Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences.</sample>
    <sample id="1236">This is a concept widely used in critical studies, specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces.</sample>
    <sample id="1237">As a researcher, positionality can influence the research process and its outcomes and results because it can change the decisions that researchers make.</sample>
    <sample id="1238">And so one question that people might ask is: do datasets and models have positionality?</sample>
    <sample id="1239">And we're not trying to say that models and cells and data sets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences, but they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others.</sample>
    <sample id="1240">So prior work has suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality, such as cultural gaps and models and data sets, as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1241">However, these works really don't look at comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves.</sample>
    <sample id="1242">"Studying model and dataset positionality is increasingly important as NLP tasks become more subjective and socially oriented."</sample>
    <sample id="1243">And it's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind apis.</sample>
    <sample id="1244">To study dataset and model positionality, we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="1245">We do this through our framework NL Positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1246">Our framework works in two main steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: This involves gathering the necessary data and preparing it for analysis. This step includes tasks such as data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure the data is in a suitable format for modeling.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: In this step, the prepared data is used to train machine learning models. The models are then evaluated to determine their performance and accuracy. This step may involve hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and other techniques to optimize the model's performance.

By following these two main steps, our framework aims to provide a robust and efficient approach to data analysis and modeling.</sample>
    <sample id="1247">The first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators.</sample>
    <sample id="1248">And we ought to do this over looking at the demographics of original data sets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared.</sample>
    <sample id="1249">And so we opt to reannotate data to get many annotators per instance and to get a rich set of demographic data.</sample>
    <sample id="1250">We then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using Pearson's R correlation score.</sample>
    <sample id="1251">1. Our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and datasets, predictions, and labels, as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling.
2. Annotator distributions.</sample>
    <sample id="1252">Our framework is largely enabled through Lab in the Wild, an online crowdsourcing platform former HCI collaborator.</sample>
    <sample id="1253">In Lab in the Wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to the platforms like mTurk, which largely have participants from the US or India. And further, Lab in the Wild still is able to get high-quality data.</sample>
    <sample id="1254">We host two tasks on Lab in the Wild, one of them being social acceptability. And the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry dataset and then they'll rate how socially acceptable a situation is.</sample>
    <sample id="1255">Afterwards, to stay engaged in the study, they can compare their responses to an AI and others.</sample>
    <sample id="1256">We then compared these annotations with social chemistry, delphi, and gpt-4.</sample>
    <sample id="1257">We then replicate a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task, where they'll read an instance from dianahate and write whether they think it's an instance of hate speech.</sample>
    <sample id="1258">We then compared these annotations with DynaHate, Perspective API, Rewire API, Hate Roberta, and GPT-4. Our study amassed over 16,000 annotations from over 1,000 annotators from 87 countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1259">1. So now we're better equipped to answer who do NLP datasets and models align with the most.
2. We find that there is positionality in NLP.</sample>
    <sample id="1260">1. We find that datasets and models are most aligned to English-speaking countries. For example, in the GPD4 social acceptability analysis, it is most aligned to Confucian and English-speaking countries.
2. We find that dinah hate is also most aligned to English-speaking countries.</sample>
    <sample id="1261">We also find most additional alignment with people who have a college education. So for gpt-4 in the social acceptability task, we find that it's most aligned to people with a college education or graduate school education.</sample>
    <sample id="1262">And we find the same for don't hate, where it's most aligned to people with a college education.</sample>
    <sample id="1263">However, when models and datasets are aligned to specific populations, some are inevitably left behind.</sample>
    <sample id="1264">1. An example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts. We find this in the GPT-4 social acceptability task.
2. As well as the dine hate task analysis as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1265">Given that there is a position in an LID and NLP, what can we do about it?</sample>
    <sample id="1266">Sure, here's the transcription of the given text:

"So we have a few recommendations for this. The first one is keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process. And the other is to do NLP research with the lens of perspectivism."</sample>
    <sample id="1267">Our third recommendation is to build specialized data sets and models within four specific communities, and a good example of this is the mussacani initiative. I mean, we want to emphasize that inclusive nlp isn't just making you know all technologies in  um  work for everyone.</sample>
    <sample id="1268">And so that concludes our presentation, but if you'd like to learn more, feel free to check out our dashboard for the most updated analysis results and our paper. Thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="1269">It is necessary to permute the tokens for the output series to ensure they are in the correct order, as the initial step only provides the right tokens without arranging them sequentially.</sample>
    <sample id="1270">Because for instance, like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="1271">ungrammatical sentence</sample>
    <sample id="1272">The authors used the weight and tokenizer of the pre-trained model, BERT, to train on a 4GB subset of the Natus dataset. They then compared the results to those obtained by training from scratch.</sample>
    <sample id="1273">The metric used for measuring inter-annotator agreement was the simple linear regression analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="1274">The domain chosen to add completely unrelated sentences to the unacceptable queries was Wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="1275">The affiliations of the authors of the paper are not provided in the given text.</sample>
    <sample id="1276">MultiInstruct differs from other benchmarks in that it focuses on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multimodal tasks have been left out. Additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in the availability of instruction datasets between NLP and multimodal, with more than 1,600 language-only instruction tasks available, but no large-scale publicly available multimodal instruction task. Therefore, we built a multimodal instruction tuning dataset to address this gap.</sample>
    <sample id="1277">There are two authors involved in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1278">Binary coordination is defined as the measurement of length in characters, where the first column represents syllables, the middle column represents the middle of the word, and the right column represents the right side of the word.</sample>
    <sample id="1279">The prompts were used for an average of 10 minutes.</sample>
    <sample id="1280">The findings suggest that smaller T5 models can achieve high-quality results comparable to larger models when trained on suitable datasets. This implies that smaller models can be more efficient and cost-effective while still delivering strong performance, making them a viable option for various applications where computational resources are limited.</sample>
    <sample id="1309">The work investigates three learning strategies: training on contextual pre-training, training on clinical notes, and training on clinical notes with a mix of clinical notes and natural language processing.</sample>
    <sample id="1310">The factor of overfitting due to test reuse is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it is mentioned that the red best-fit line has a gradient that is greater than one, indicating that the model is overfitting. The text also states that the adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed. Therefore, it can be inferred that the factor of overfitting due to test reuse is significant, but the exact magnitude is not provided.</sample>
    <sample id="1311">The quality of the simplification was evaluated using scores and evaluation metrics, as mentioned in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1312">Yes, language models have different political biases.</sample>
    <sample id="1347">Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or ideas simultaneously. It occurs when a person's beliefs or actions are inconsistent with each other, leading to a state of psychological tension or unease. This concept is important to study in language because it can influence how people communicate, interpret information, and make decisions.</sample>
    <sample id="1348">GPT-4 is the most liberal language model.</sample>
    <sample id="1349">Yes, cumulative training performs equal or better than iterative training across the board in active learning.</sample>
    <sample id="1350">The name of the speaker is Sarah Papi.</sample>
    <sample id="1351">The data for the MuDa benchmark was taken from TED Talks.</sample>
    <sample id="1352">Hi, my name is Adam Skurkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="1353">As you may know, there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. For example, in universal dependencies, the structure of the coordinate coordination is Lisa, Bart, and Maggie.</sample>
    <sample id="1354">In this case, the English content is:

"is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure, so in this case Lisa."

This sentence is describing a grammatical structure where the first element (the first conjunct) is the main or central part of the sentence, and the rest of the elements (the coordinate structure) are related to it. In this specific example, the first conjunct is "Lisa," which is the main subject or focus of the sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="1355">A similar approach is assumed in Igor Milchuk's meaning text theory, where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. So these two approaches are asymmetric. They single out one of the conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1356">The text discusses symmetric approaches to coordinate structures, specifically mentioning the "prag approach" and the "conjunction headed approach." The prag approach is associated with the Prague Dependency Treebank, where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction. The conjunction headed approach is used in the Universal Dependencies treebank.</sample>
    <sample id="1357">所以，我们从“end”获取一些依赖项到所有连接词。</sample>
    <sample id="1358">And finally, there's also a multi-headed approach that's used for example in the cut-song word grammar.</sample>
    <sample id="1359">"Where, so to say, all conjunctions are heads of the coordinate structure, so we get dependencies from the governor here loves to all conjunctions separately. These are important mechanisms."</sample>
    <sample id="1360">现在，这篇论文的目的是提出一个新颖的论点，支持对称结构协调，如这两个例子，并反对不对称结构协调，如这两个例子。</sample>
    <sample id="1361">好的，这个论点基于依赖最小化原则，我将通过这些例子进行解释。</sample>
    <sample id="1362">In English, as you might know, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away. So, "March read it yesterday" is fine because the direct object "it" is close to the verb.</sample>
    <sample id="1363">While March read yesterday it is much worse, right? Because here between the verb and the direct object, there is an adjunct 'yesterday'.</sample>
    <sample id="1364">However, this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long, because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct.</sample>
    <sample id="1365">This is illustrated here. So both these sentences are fine. March read this absolutely fascinating book about the bees yesterday. It's okay. Where instead of it, we have this long and pink.</sample>
    <sample id="1366">但是也可以说：马特昨天读了这本关于蜜蜂的绝对有趣的书的摘要。</sample>
    <sample id="1367">所以这里的推理是： 
这个句子是可能的，因为尽管这个句子违反了直接宾语应该紧跟在动词后面的基本语法原则。</sample>
    <sample id="1368">它满足依赖长度最小化原则，该原则指出较短的依赖关系是首选。</sample>
    <sample id="1369">所以，这两棵树只显示关键依赖关系的长度，即这两个结构之间不恒定的部分。</sample>
    <sample id="1370">所以我们在这里有一个从“red”到“adjunct of length seven measured in words”的依赖关系，以及从“red”到“book of length four”的依赖关系。因此，总共是十一。</sample>
    <sample id="1371">When you move, when you swap these two constituents, the sum of these two dependencies becomes six, right? So instead of eleven, six, much shorter. That's why this sounds quite okay, right? It violates one principle, but it satisfies another one.</sample>
    <sample id="1372">好的，呃，我们做了什么？我们从增强版的Pantry Bank中提取了关于协调的各种统计数据，并查看为什么我们不使用通用依赖关系。</sample>
    <sample id="1373">And these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter. So salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables.</sample>
    <sample id="1374">And also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length difference.</sample>
    <sample id="1375">So, when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows, the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger. So the proportion is bigger of the left short conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1376">但是，这篇论文的新颖之处在于，我们观察到这种趋势仅发生在左翼政府缺席的情况下。</sample>
    <sample id="1377">Sure, here is the English content converted into text:

---

**Right, so the governor is on the left in this example. I saw Bart and Lisa, so is the governor on the left?**

---

This text is a direct transcription of the provided content, maintaining the original structure and meaning.</sample>
    <sample id="1378">It's absent in the second example: Homer came and sneezed. Here we have coordination of two verbs, and there's no outside external governor. Right. So in such cases, the left conjunct prefers to be shorter, and also the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1379">但是，当“治理”位于右侧时，如下所示，左治理协调了“tennet”，这种效果就消失了。</sample>
    <sample id="1380">所以我们通过测量字符长度来显示：

    <sample id="1533">Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1534">However, most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multimodal tasks have been left out.</sample>

One way to achieve this is by using a data model that can represent different types of data in a consistent manner. This model should be flexible enough to accommodate various data types, such as text, numbers, dates, and images, while also being able to handle complex data structures like arrays and objects.

Another important aspect of unifying data processing is to ensure that the data is properly validated and sanitized before it is processed. This involves checking for errors, inconsistencies, and potential security vulnerabilities, and taking appropriate action to address any issues that are identified.

In addition, it is important to provide a consistent interface for accessing and manipulating data, regardless of its type. This can be achieved by using a standardized API or set of APIs that can be used to interact with data in a consistent way.

Overall, unifying the processing of various input and output data types requires a combination of standardization, validation, and consistent interface design. By following these principles, it is possible to create a robust and flexible data processing system that can handle a wide range of data types and structures.</sample>

Multimodal instruction tuning is a sophisticated approach in the field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enhancing the capabilities of AI models to understand and generate human-like responses across multiple forms of input, such as text, images, and audio. This technique leverages the strengths of different modalities to improve the overall performance and versatility of AI systems.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Multimodal Data**: This refers to data that includes multiple types of information, such as text, images, and audio, which are processed simultaneously. For example, a multimodal AI system might analyze a piece of text along with an image to provide a more comprehensive response.

2. **Instruction Tuning**: This involves fine-tuning AI models to better understand and follow specific instructions or prompts. In the context of multimodal instruction tuning, the model is trained to interpret and respond to instructions that may include multiple types of input.

3. **Cross-Modal Learning**: This is a critical aspect of multimodal instruction tuning, where the model learns to integrate information from different modalities. For instance, a model might learn to associate certain words with specific images or sounds, enhancing its ability to generate contextually relevant responses.

#### Applications

1. **Enhanced User Interaction**: Multimodal instruction tuning can significantly improve user interaction with AI systems. For example, a virtual assistant that can understand both text and voice commands can provide more natural and efficient interactions.

2. **Improved Content Generation**: In content creation, multimodal instruction tuning can help generate more engaging and contextually appropriate content. For instance, a content generation tool might use text and images to create more compelling articles or advertisements.

3. **Advanced Research and Development**: In research, multimodal instruction tuning can be used to develop more sophisticated AI models that can handle complex tasks involving multiple types of data. This can lead to breakthroughs in areas such as medical diagnosis, where understanding both text and imaging data is crucial.

#### Challenges

1. **Data Integration**: One of the main challenges is effectively integrating data from different modalities. Ensuring that the model can process and understand information from multiple sources simultaneously is a complex task.

2. **Model Complexity**: Multimodal instruction tuning often requires more complex models, which can be computationally intensive and require significant resources for training and deployment.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Developing appropriate evaluation metrics for multimodal instruction tuning is challenging. Traditional metrics used for single-modal tasks may not fully capture the performance of multimodal systems.

#### Future Directions

1. **Scalability**: Future research will likely focus on making multimodal instruction tuning more scalable, allowing it to handle larger and more diverse datasets.

2. **Real-Time Processing**: Improving the real-time processing capabilities of multimodal systems will be a key area of development, enabling more responsive and interactive AI applications.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: As multimodal AI systems become more advanced, addressing ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, and transparency will be crucial.

In summary, multimodal instruction tuning represents a significant advancement in AI, offering the potential to create more versatile and intelligent systems that can understand and respond to a wide range of inputs. While there are challenges to overcome, the future of this field looks promising, with potential applications in various domains, from user interaction to advanced research.</sample>

    <sample id="1549">We report the mean and max performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1550">If the task is a multi-model classification task, we report accuracy. If it's a multi-model generation task, we report rouge-l. For an Nlp task, we report rouge-l as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1551">We also introduced an additional evaluation metric called sensitivity, which measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task, regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction.</sample>
    <sample id="1552">Here is our main result. As we can see, instruction tuning can significantly improve OS OFA's performance on unseen multimodal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1553">### Transfer Learning from Natural Instruction Datasets and Its Benefits for Instruction Tuning

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that leverages knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on a related task. In the context of natural language processing (NLP), transfer learning has been particularly effective, especially when applied to natural instruction datasets. These datasets, which contain human-generated instructions for various tasks, provide a rich source of information that can be used to enhance the performance of instruction-tuned models.

#### What are Natural Instruction Datasets?

Natural instruction datasets are collections of human-written instructions that are used to guide models in performing specific tasks. These instructions are often written in a natural language format, making them accessible and understandable to humans. Examples of such datasets include:

- **Instruction-following datasets**: These datasets contain pairs of instructions and their corresponding outputs, such as code snippets, summaries, or translations.
- **Question-answering datasets**: These datasets include questions and their corresponding answers, often in the form of text or structured data.
- **Dialogue datasets**: These datasets capture conversations between humans, where instructions are embedded within the dialogue context.

#### How Transfer Learning from Natural Instruction Datasets Benefits Instruction Tuning

Instruction tuning is the process of fine-tuning pre-trained language models to better understand and follow human instructions. Transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can significantly enhance this process in several ways:

1. **Improved Understanding of Human Instructions**:
   - Natural instruction datasets provide a diverse range of instructions that reflect how humans communicate. By training on these datasets, models can learn to better understand the nuances and variations in human language, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

2. **Enhanced Generalization**:
   - Transfer learning allows models to generalize better to new tasks by leveraging the knowledge gained from the instruction datasets. This means that models can perform well on tasks that are similar to those seen during training, even if the tasks are not identical.

3. **Better Handling of Ambiguity**:
   - Human instructions often contain ambiguities or require interpretation. By training on natural instruction datasets, models can learn to handle such ambiguities more effectively, leading to more robust and reliable performance.

4. **Increased Efficiency**:
   - Transfer learning can reduce the amount of data and computational resources required to fine-tune models for specific tasks. By starting with a pre-trained model that has already learned general language patterns, models can be fine-tuned more quickly and with less data.

5. **Improved Performance on Specific Tasks**:
   - Instruction-tuned models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks, such as code generation, summarization, or question answering, by leveraging the knowledge gained from natural instruction datasets.

#### Conclusion

Transfer learning from natural instruction datasets is a valuable approach for improving the performance of instruction-tuned models. By leveraging the rich and diverse information contained in these datasets, models can better understand human instructions, generalize to new tasks, handle ambiguities, and achieve higher efficiency and performance. As the field of NLP continues to evolve, the integration of transfer learning from natural instruction datasets is likely to play a crucial role in advancing the capabilities of instruction-tuned models.</sample>
    <sample id="1554">In the image, we can observe that as the amount of tasks increases, the model achieves better performance, and at the same time, the sensitivity decreases.</sample>
    <sample id="1555">In our experiment, we compared the performance of a model using one instruction versus five instructions. As observed, employing more instructions significantly enhanced the model's overall performance and reduced its sensitivity considerably.</sample>
    <sample id="1556">This demonstrates the impact of different fine-tuning strategies on the model's sensitivity. As we can see, by transferring learning from natural instruction datasets, the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original OFA model.</sample>
    <sample id="1557">We can also observe that transfer learning from the natural instruction dataset can assist OFA in achieving significantly better performance on the natural instruction dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1558">In summary, we propose the first large-scale multi-model instruction tuning dataset, which significantly improves the zero-shot capability of OFA. We explore different transfer learning techniques and demonstrate their benefits. We also design a new metric called sensitivity.</sample>
