    <sample id="2">This paper presents LayoutMask, a novel pre-trained model for Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) that addresses the issue of reading order in existing document pre-training models. Unlike previous methods that use global 1D positions to represent token order, LayoutMask employs local 1D positions, which are derived from in-segment token orders. This approach allows the model to infer global reading order by combining 1D position, 2D position (spatial information), and semantic information.

To enhance text-layout interactions, LayoutMask introduces two novel masking strategies: Whole Word Masking (WWM) and Layout-Aware Masking (LAM). WWM sets masks at the word level, eliminating semantic relations between masked and unmasked tokens, and requiring the model to find more context to predict masked words. LAM masks the first and last words of each segment, encouraging the model to pay more attention to finding their contexts in preceding or succeeding segments, promoting cross-segment order learning.

Additionally, LayoutMask introduces a new pre-training objective, Masked Position Modelling (MPM), which involves recovering randomly masked 2D positions during pre-processing. This task is similar to a cloze test, where a group of randomly chosen words is supposed to be refilled at the correct positions in the original documents.

Experiments on FUNSD, SROIE, and CORD datasets show that LayoutMask outperforms existing models using local 1D positions, particularly in cases where the entity "Total" is present. The model's ability to infer global reading order and learn better layout representations makes it a promising approach for VrDU tasks.</sample>

This model aims to generate summaries in any target language from a document in any source language. The authors conducted preliminary experiments on the WikiLingua dataset, which includes English, French, Hindi, Chinese, and Thai, using the mBART-50 backbone. They compared their many-to-many summarization model with separate multilingual and cross-lingual models, as well as a unified cross-lingual model. The results showed that the many-to-many summarization model outperformed the other models in transferring task knowledge across languages. The authors also proposed a pre-trained many-to-many summarization (PISCES) model, which was trained through a three-stage pre-training process. The experimental results showed that PISCES outperformed various baselines, including mBART-</sample>

    <sample id="8">The novelty of the proposed human evaluation method, ABC-Eval, lies in its ability to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by annotating specific behaviors in chat models, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicted themselves. This approach allows for a more precise and reliable measurement of chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect conversation quality. ABC-Eval measures the rates at which chat models commit various thematic errors, providing a comprehensive evaluation of chat model behaviors.</sample>
    <sample id="9">The success of existing weakly supervised learning (WSL) approaches heavily relies on clean, manually annotated validation samples. Without these clean validation samples, the models tend to overfit to the weak labels and do not generalize well. Additionally, increasing the number of clean validation samples improves performance, and continuing fine-tuning on these clean samples can achieve even better results.</sample>
    <sample id="10">To improve the score, the following advances can be considered:

1. **Enhanced Background Knowledge**: Providing more comprehensive and accurate background information about the entities can help the language model make better disambiguation decisions.

2. **Improved Contextual Understanding**: Enhancing the model's ability to understand and utilize contextual information from the dialogue can lead to more accurate entity selection.

3. **Better Sampling Methods**: Refining the sampling methods to ensure a more balanced and challenging set of examples can help the model generalize better.

4. **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data can improve its performance in specific contexts, such as music, books, or recipes.

5. **Advanced Disambiguation Techniques**: Implementing more sophisticated disambiguation techniques, such as leveraging additional features or using more complex models, can improve accuracy.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback**: Incorporating feedback from human annotators to continuously improve the model's performance can lead to better results.

7. **Multimodal Inputs**: Utilizing multimodal inputs, such as images or audio, can provide additional context and improve the model's ability to disambiguate entities.

8. **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging transfer learning from related tasks or domains can help the model generalize better and improve its performance.

By addressing these areas, the accuracy and performance of the language model can be significantly improved.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presents his work on "Finding the SWEET Spot: Analysis和改进 of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings," conducted in Professor Roy Schwartz's lab at Hebrew University. Adaptive inference aims to reduce the inference time of large language models by using low-capacity models for simpler samples. Two common methods are Multi Model and Early Exit. Multi Model stores multiple models and runs them sequentially, while Early Exit uses multiple classifiers trained together, halting computation when a classifier decides. Early Exit offers faster inference and memory efficiency but suffers from conflicting gradients due to shared model parameters. Rotem hypothesizes that conflicting gradients degrade performance. To address this, he introduces SWEET (Separating Weights in Early Exit Transformers), a fine-tuning method where each layer receives updates only from the following classifer, avoiding conflicting gradients. SWEET closes the performance gap between Early Exit and Multi Model but slightly affects later classifiers. The results show SWEET outperforms both methods in speed/accuracy trade-offs, motivating future research on fine-tuning algorithms for Early Exit architectures.</sample>

    <sample id="17">This paper introduces a novel multimodal relation extraction (MRE) framework that addresses two key challenges: internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation. Traditional MRE methods rely solely on text, which can lack sufficient context to understand ambiguous or multi-context words. To address this, the proposed method incorporates visual evidence, such as "Bachelor", "Gown", and "Cap", to infer relationships between entities. However, not all visual sources are always beneficial, and some may even be negative. To overcome these issues, the framework employs a Graph Information Bottleneck principle-guided feature refinement and leverages multimodal topic information as additional semantic supplementary. The proposed method consists of five parts: representing text and image with visual scene graphs, merging the visual and textual scene graphs into a unified backbone cross-modal graph (CMG), screening the initial CMG structures, enriching the compressed CMG features with multimodal topic features, and evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method on a widely used MRE dataset. The results show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing best models on the benchmarks. The internal-information screening and external-information exploiting play different roles depending on the text-vision relevance scores of the input instances. The internal-information screening is more important for high cross-modal relevance inputs, while the external-information exploiting is more useful for low cross-modal relevance inputs. The proposed method introduces a novel idea of simultaneous information subtraction and addition, and achieves significant improvements over existing best models on the MRE benchmarks.</sample>

The paper focuses on the challenges of open-domain question answering, including the large size of the Wikipedia corpus, the bottleneck of index file searching, and the complexity of multiple language models. The authors propose efficient tactics to achieve smaller memory costs, faster inference, and comparable performance. They summarize core techniques, including retrieval and reader frameworks, one-stage frameworks, and efficient tactics such as approximate nearest neighbor search, skip reading, and embedding compression. The authors compare existing open-domain question answering models and conclude that retrieval-only systems are suitable for resource-constrained devices, while retrieval and reader systems are more appropriate for trade-offs. The paper also discusses future works, including deployment in low-power devices and the consideration of more evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="22">The factors that lead to good generalization, as found in the paper, are:

1. Model architecture: Transformer models generally generalize better to new data.

These factors are interdependent, and all are necessary for good generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="23">This paper discusses the challenges faced by text-to-image models in rendering text accurately, particularly focusing on the Imagen model. The Imagen model uses a T5-XXL encoder to encode input text and a diffusion model to generate images. However, these models often struggle with representing text, especially when the input requires the image to contain a word. The authors investigate the degree to which text encoders, like T5, know how to spell words, and find that even the largest T5 model gets under 70% accuracy. In contrast, PaLM models, which are larger and trained on more data, perform better but are impractical for many applications. ByT5, a model that receives individual bytes of the input string, performs well at spelling and is unaffected by word frequency. The authors propose an improvement to the Imagen model by augmenting it with a text representation from ByT5-small, which increases the parameter count by only 5%. This results in improved image generation characteristics and the ability to render text. The main takeaways are the WikiSpell benchmark for text-only models and the DrawText benchmark for text-to-image models.</sample>
    <sample id="24">The tendency for left conjuncts to be shorter was measured by analyzing the length of dependencies in sentences, specifically the length of the dependency from the governor to the conjuncts. The study used the enhanced version of the Penn Treebank and measured the length in words, syllables, and characters. The results showed that when the governor is on the left or absent, the left conjunct tends to be shorter, and this tendency grows with the absolute difference in length between the two conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="25">The experiments were designed to study the effect of the governor's position by analyzing the length of dependencies in coordination structures. The researchers measured the length of dependencies from the governor to the conjuncts in sentences with the governor on the left, the governor absent, and the governor on the right. They found that when the governor is on the left or absent, the shorter conjunct tends to be the first one, while when the governor is on the right, this effect disappears. This suggests that the governor's position affects the preference for the shorter conjunct in coordination structures.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The paper "LLM-Blender" introduces a novel ensemble learning framework for large language models, addressing the challenge of selecting the optimal model for a given input. The framework leverages pairwise ranking and generative fusion to improve performance over single-model approaches. By running multiple models on an input and using a pairwise ranking module called PairRanker, the framework can identify the best-performing models for each input. The PairRanker module encodes pairs of candidate outputs alongside the input, allowing for a more nuanced comparison of their quality. The framework then uses the top-ranked candidates to generate a final output through a sequence-to-sequence model. Experiments on the MixInstruct dataset demonstrate that LLM-Blender significantly outperforms individual models and other ensemble methods, with a 68% and 76% improvement over Open Assistant and Vicuna, respectively, on average. The paper highlights the effectiveness of the PairRanker module and the simplicity of the LLM-Blender framework, making it a promising approach for ensemble learning in large language models.</sample>

    <sample id="33">The introduced framework, NLPositionality, quantifies the positionality by comparing the annotations made by diverse annotators with the predictions and labels of existing datasets and models. It uses a Pearson's R correlation score to measure the alignment between the annotations and the models.

By analyzing the annotations and comparing them to the models, the framework can identify biases and positionality in NLP datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="34">CREST is a joint framework for rationalization and counterf actual text generation, developed by Marcos Treviso, Alexis Ross, Nuno Guerreiro, André Martins. The framework combines selective rationalization and counterfactual generation to produce valid, fluent, and diverse counterfactual examples. CREST's first component generates counterfactuals by masking the original input and prepending the gold label, then using a masked language model to fill in the masked response. The second component performs rationalization with both factual and counterf actual examples, using a shared rationalizer to learn to highlight meaningful rationales. CREST counterf actuals are evaluated using human evaluation and found to be more valid and natural than those generated using other methods. CREST counterf actuals are also used for data augmentation, and the framework's rationales are found to be more plausible and achieve higher counterf actual simulability than those produced by other methods. Overall, CREST is a promising approach for improving downstream models and producing plausible explanations that focus on the contrasting parts of input.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The paper "Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual
Machine Translation" presents a novel approach to improve the capacity of multilingual machine translation models without increasing inference costs. The authors introduce Language-Specific Layers (LSLs), which allow for language-specific training and inference at the cost of a single model. The LSLs are trained using a large model with shared, source, and target weights, and the best placement of LSLs is learned by selecting the weight with the largest magnitude. The authors evaluate their approach on WMT21 news translation mask sources, including low-resource languages, and report significant improvements over baseline models and language adapters. The results show that the approach gives improvements for every language, with particularly large improvements for low-resource languages. The authors also provide a full paper and poster session for further information.</sample>

    <sample id="41">Silin from the Natural Language Processing Lab at EPFL presents their work on "PeaCoK: Persona Commonsens Knowledge for Consistent and Engaging Narratives," in collaboration with Sony Group Corporation. The goal is to create a Persona-grounded Commonsens Knowledge Graph (PeaCoK) to represent world-level persona knowledge at scale. PeaCok contains about 3,800 personas, 40,000 distinctive attributes and 100,000 personal inference or facts. The relations of personas and their attributes are framed in three dimensions, including four types of main relation, interactivity, and distinctiveness. The graph is built in three steps: selecting personas from existing commonsense graphs, inducing attributes of personas from commonsense knowledge graphs and large-scale pre-trained models, and crowdsourcing the annotations of PeaCoK relations using joint human-AI majority voting scheme. The graph is used to train a BART-based common knowledge generator, which achieves better automatic evaluation results and higher accept rate in human evaluation. The graph is also used to improve downstream narrative modeling, where a knowledge linker retrieves facts from PeaCoK that are relevant and augment each speaker's profile. Human evaluation shows that PeaCoK-augmented models achieve better dialogue generation on various aspects, and the winning rates of PeaCoK augmented models increase as the number of shared common attributes between the two speakers becomes larger. The paper and GitHub site for this work are public.</sample>

    <sample id="50">The presentation introduces DEPLAIN, a new corpus for German document-level and sentence-level text simplification. Text simplification aims to adapt texts for better comprehension by specific target groups, such as people with reading difficulties or non-native speakers. To train a text-simplification model, parallel pairs of texts are required. However, existing corpora have limitations, such as being too small or having error-prone automatic alignments. DEPLAIN addresses these issues by providing two subcorpora: DEPLAIN-APA, based on manually aligned news texts, and DEPLAIN-web, which includes various domains and uses both manual and automatic alignment methods. The corpus contains approximately 30,450 sentence pairs and offers a high variety of simplification transformations.

The presentation also discusses two use cases for the DEPLAIN corpus. The first use case involves evaluating automatic alignment methods, where the corpus serves as a gold standard for assessing the performance of different alignment techniques. The second use case focuses on automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models. The researchers fine-tuned two models, long-mBART for document-level simplifications and normal base mBART for sentence-level simplifications, achieving better scores than baseline methods. The results are presented as a benchmark for future research in automatic text simplification.</sample>

    <sample id="54">Vasudha presents her work on "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: A Long Paper Accepted into ACL 2023." Cognitive dissonance, the inconsistency between beliefs and actions, is a rare phenomenon in language but crucial for understanding human decision-making, mental health, and societal trends. To address the challenge of rare-class detection, Vasudha's team annotated a large-scale dataset of dissonance relations, finding that only 3.5% of pairs exhibited dissonance. Initial classifiers performed poorly due to the rarity of dissonance. To overcome this, they employed transfer learning and active learning, transferring weights from related tasks like debate stance classification and binary classification of PDTB. The best-performing model, fine-tuned on CE tasks followed by debate, achieved a zero-shot AUC of 0.62. They compared different active learning strategies, finding that the Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy outperformed others, improving dissonance classification AUC to 0.85. The PRC strategy, while effective for rare class acquisition, was challenging for annotators. The study highlights the benefits of transfer learning, iterative updates, and PRC for rare-class detection, offering insights into cognitive dissonance and its implications for mental health and societal trends.</sample>

The study compares DrBERT with ChuBERT, a clinical model based on anonymized data from Nantes University Hospital, and evaluates the impact of pre-training strategies on French data. The results show that models trained on data of the same nature as the task perform best, but data from heterogeneous sources appears more versatile. From-scratch pre-training generally yields higher performance, but control pre-training using CamemBERT weights and tokenizer can achieve comparable results.

    <sample id="66">Mathematical reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, involves comprehending and making decisions based on numerical data and language. Recent advancements in AI and NLP have focused on developing machines capable of solving math problems and proving theorems. This survey explores the task of mathematical reasoning and the development of deep learning methods. Mathematical reasoning can extend beyond text-based data to multimodal information like images, figures, tables, and geometric diagrams. Automated theorem proving aims to demonstrate the truth of mathematical claims through a sequence of arguments, with datasets like Numeric Commonsense Knowledge and High-Level Problem Solving probing language models' human-level intelligence. Neural network architectures, such as sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-tree models, have been proposed for math reasoning tasks. Pre-trained language models, like large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable performance on NLP tasks, including solving math word problems. However, LLMs face limitations, such as the lack of precise mathematical reasoning. Solutions like self-consistency and program-aided LMMs have been proposed to enhance performance. Despite progress, mathematical reasoning in low-resource settings remains underexploited, with recent efforts to build non-English datasets and benchmarks for various domains. Despite impressive progress, learning models commonly display generalization and robustness failures on math reasoning tasks, such as struggling with large numbers and inconsistency with mathematical reasoning.</sample>
    <sample id="67">This work investigates the phenomenon of interference in multilingual translation models, where training to translate one language pair can either improve or degrade the quality of another. The authors identify that severe interference occurs when the model is small compared to the data size, and that adjusting the sampling temperature is crucial for optimal performance. They conducted experiments using four variants of the Transformer architecture and 15 languages from the WMT dataset, ranging from 50 million to 150,000 sentence pairs. The results show that language similarity and the number of languages have a minimal impact on interference levels. The authors found that severe interference is more prevalent in smaller models and can be mitigated by increasing the model size and tuning the temperature. They conclude that a baseline for combating interference is weak due to size in small models and uncalibrated temperature in larger models. The key takeaway is that modest scale and tuned temperature can significantly reduce interference without the need for specialized methods.</sample>

    <sample id="74">This paper introduces Dense-ATOMIC, a densely-connected commonsense knowledge graph that addresses the limitations of the existing ATOMIC knowledge base. ATOMIC, while high-quality, has sparse graph structures and lacks multi-hop paths, leading to unsatisfactory knowledge coverage. Dense-ATOMIC completes missing links, including B-to-A, B-to-B,A-to-B, and A-to-A links, and contains multi-hop paths. The construction of Dense-ATOMIC involves normalizing tail events, training a relation prediction method, and constructing the knowledge graph. The proposed method, Rel-CSKGC, predicts relations between head and tail events using pre-trained language models, avoiding sparsity and utilizing semantic information. The performance of Rel-CSKGC is evaluated against relation prediction methods and translation-based methods, demonstrating superior performance. Dense-ATOMIC yields higher knowledge coverage and benefits the performance of COMET, a commonsense reasoning model. The paper concludes that Dense-ATOMIC has the potential for commonsense reasoning and provides code and a website for further research.</sample>
    <sample id="75">Zheng Yandan presents her work on Jointprop, a joint semi-supervised learning framework for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). The motivation behind Jointprop is to address the limitations of fully-supervised models that require extensive labeled data and the inefficiencies of current semi-supervised models that neglect the interconnections between NER and RE tasks. Jointprop aims to fully integrate information from both labeled and unlabeled data by propagating labels over heterogeneous graphs. The framework consists of span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint-label propagation, and model optimization.

    <sample id="76">The political bias propagation pipeline involves evaluating the political leaning of language models, understanding the role of pretraining data in political biases, and investigating the performance of language models with different political leanings on downstream tasks. This includes:

1. Evaluating the political leaning of language models using political questionnaires and automatic evaluation grounded in political science literature.
2. Investigating the extent to which political biases are picked up from training data by conducting controlled experiments with pretraining language model checkpoints on partisan corpora.
3. Examining whether language models can pick up societal polarization by dividing pretraining corpora into pre- and post-45th president of the United States and observing shifts in political leaning.
4. Evaluating language models with different political leanings on hate crime detection and fake news detection tasks, and analyzing their performance across different demographics and political leaning of news media.

The pipeline highlights the unique dilemma of language model political biases, as sanitizing political opinions in training data may lead to censorship or exclusion, while not sanitizing may result in fairness issues in downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="77">This video presents the work "On Improving Summarization Factual Consistence from Natural Language Feedback," a joint effort between Yale University and Microsoft Research. The project introduces a new dataset, DeFacto, which includes human demonstrations and feedback aimed at enhancing summarization factual consistency. The dataset is based on the XSum dataset and includes system-generated summaries from the pre-trained Pegasus model. Annotators were tasked with evaluating the factual consistency of these summaries and providing human-corrected, factually consistent summaries along with feedback, explanations, and evidence.

The study reveals that 70% of the collected data points contained factual errors, and human-edited summaries achieved higher automatic factuality scores compared to the initial system outputs, though with lower textual overlap. The researchers propose three new NLG tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual correction. They found that both fine-tuned models and zero-shot large language language models can effectively leverage human feedback for summary editing. Feedback generation remains challenging, and automatic correction of factual errors with explanations can be achieved with fewer data points.

DeFacto serves as a valuable testbed for the proposed tasks and offers fine-grained annotations that can aid in training factuality metrics and meta-evaluation. The dataset is available on GitHub, and the paper provides further details.</sample>

    <sample id="82">Automated Essay Scoring (AES) aims to evaluate the quality of essays without human intervention, a crucial application of natural language processing in education. Traditional AES models rely on large labeled corpora, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect. Unsupervised AES, which does not require ground-truth scores, has significant potential but faces challenges due to the limitations of single quality signals. This paper introduces a novel framework, ULRA (Unsupervised AES by Learning from Rank Aggregation), to address these challenges. ULRA aggregates multiple heuristic quality signals, such as the number of unique terms and word count, to generate pseudo-groundtruth scores. The framework includes a heuristic essay ranking module (HER) to rank essays based on these signals and generate partial-order pairs. A Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation Module (DPRA) then aggregates these partial-order pairs into a unified supervision for training a neural AES model. The model is trained using a learnable confidence weight for each signal to address inconsistencies. In experiments, ULRA outperforms unsupervised baselines and achieves competitive performance with cross-prompt and one-shot methods. However, it still lags behind general supervised methods due to the lack of strong supervision. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ULRA for unsupervised essay scoring by conducting experiments in both transductive and inductive settings.</sample>

    <sample id="84">In this paper, we introduce PAD-Net, a novel framework for dynamic networks that addresses the issue of excessive parameter usage in fully dynamic networks. Traditional networks are static, while dynamic networks adapt their architecture or parameters based on input. However, fully dynamic networks often have redundant parameters, leading to large model sizes. Our hypothesis is that partially dynamic sub-networks can maintain or exceed the representation power of the original static network. We partition parameters into dynamic and static modes, using Iterative Mode Partition to identify redundant dynamic parameters. Our experiments show that PAD-Net outperforms static and fully dynamic networks in terms of performance and parameter efficiency. We also find that the Scale Factors for dynamic and static parameters are crucial for accuracy. Our method significantly outperforms network pruning and maintains the discriminative output of fully dynamic networks. Future work includes extending PAD-Net to other networks and hardware-friendly structures, as well as exploring combinations of zero elements, static, and dynamic parameters.</sample>

They compare DrBERT with ChuBERT and other models trained on different data sources and pre-training strategies to evaluate their performance on various biomedical and clinical downstream tasks. The results show that models trained on data of the same nature as the tasks perform best, but data from heterogeneous sources appears to be more versatile. The authors conclude that from-scratch pre-training generally obtains higher performance, but control pre-training using the weight and tokenization from CamemBERT trained on a subset of NACHOS can yield comparable results.</sample>

Contribute?" explores the feasibility of using language learners as annotators for Natural Language Processing (NLP) data, challenging the conventional reliance on native speakers. The study targets three languages—English, Korean, and Indonesian—selected for their resource availability and learning difficulty. Four tasks from the GLUE benchmark—sentiment analysis, NLI, NER, and MRC—are used to assess annotation accuracy. Learners are categorized into three proficiency levels and compared with native speakers. The experiments include a preliminary survey, pre-test, annotation, and post-test phases, with learners using additional resources like dictionaries and machine translation. Results show that learners' annotations are nearly as accurate as native speakers', especially for simpler tasks. Aggregating learner labels through majority voting achieves near-native speaker performance. The study demonstrates that language learners can significantly improve their language proficiency and vocabulary through annotation tasks. It suggests a novel approach to building NLP datasets for low-resource languages by recruiting learners, thereby overcoming geographic and technological barriers. The paper concludes that language learners can effectively contribute to NLP annotation, broadening research opportunities for many languages.</sample>

    <sample id="94">Jingwei Yi from the University of Science and Technology in China presents a paper on protecting the copyright of embedding as services using a backdoor watermark method. Embedding as services, such as those provided by OpenAI, are built on large language models and assist in various natural language processing tasks. However, recent research has shown that attackers can steal these models by learning from the embedding and providing similar services. To protect the copyright of embedding as service, a watermark method is proposed that meets the following properties: applicability to embedding as services, no degradation of embedding utility, covertness to attackers, and transferability to the attacker's services during model extraction. The proposed method, called Embedding Marker, consists of two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. The watermark injection step involves injecting a target embedding into the provider's service, while the copyright verification step involves detecting whether another service contains the watermark. The paper presents experimental results on four datasets, showing that the proposed method has great detection performance while maintaining great utility for downstream tasks. The covertness of the provided embedding is also validated by visualizing the embedding of sentences on four datasets.</sample>

Additionally, it is important to evaluate the political leanings of language models and their performance on downstream tasks to identify and address potential fairness issues. This can be done by using political questionnaires and analyzing the performance of language models on tasks such as hate speech detection and fake news detection. It is also important to consider the potential risks of censorship or exclusion when trying to sanitize language model training data.</sample>
    <sample id="100">Multi-hop QA involves answering questions that require multiple reasoning steps, each corresponding to a document in a corpus. Traditional multi-hop retrievers require thousands of examples for good performance, which can be expensive. PromptRank, a data-efficient approach, uses an unsupervised retrieval method combined with a few-shot language model-based reranking. It retrieves candidate chains using TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, then reranks them using a language model. The chain prompt is constructed by inserting documents and using an instruction to elicit reasoning. PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods. It uses GPT2-XL and T5-XL models and evaluates on HotpotQA with metrics like R@K recall and answer recall AR@K. Ablation studies show the importance of each component, and downstream QA performance is evaluated with ELECTRA-Large. PromptRank demonstrates strong few-shot path retrieval performance and elicits reasoning abilities effectively.</sample>

The dataset includes over 3,000 entity-seeking queries from four domains: films, books, plants, and animals, where queries contain set operations. The authors construct QUEST by performing set operations over atomic categories and asking human annotators to paraphrase and validate queries for fluency and naturalness. The dataset poses a challenging retrieval problem since systems need effectively search over a large document corpus to find answers with attribution for different query constraints. The authors evaluate systems on QUEST using sparse and dense retrievers, as well as a T5-based reranking system. They find that there is a large room for improvement on the recall of the complete answer set, and that queries with set intersection and set difference are the most challenging. The authors hope that QUEST can help future researchers build improved systems for information-seeking scenarios with selective information needs.</sample>

Additionally, the models were evaluated in both monolingual and multilingual settings, with the multilingual models showing significant improvements when trained on a mixture of languages.</sample>
    <sample id="108">This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating language model acceptability judgments by extending the minimal pair paradigm to longer sequences. The authors argue that current methods, which evaluate models on single sentences, are insufficient for assessing their performance on longer contexts. To address this, they simulate longer sequences by recreating sentences from existing datasets, either by adding prefixes to acceptable or unacceptable sentences or by using sentences from different subsets or domains. The results show that language models' acceptability judgments are sensitive to the context, with significant changes in MPP judgments when the context is from the same or different domains. The authors also found that models are sensitive to perturbed sentences, with similar effects on MPP judgments regardless of the perturbation. The key takeaway is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic, semantic, and contextual features, and current evaluation methods may not fully capture their abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="109">Unnatural Instructions is a dataset of natural language instructions and their inputs and outputs, collected in a fully automatic manner without human labor. The dataset is created by prompting a pre-trained language model, specifically a variant of GPT-3, with three examples from the Super-Natural Instructions dataset and asking the model to generate a fourth example. The dataset is further diversified by generating additional paraphrases of each instruction. The resulting dataset contains 64k examples, and if we consider the instruction paraphrasing, we have about 240k examples. The authors analyze the generated examples, focusing on creativity, accuracy, and diversity. They find that more than 50% of generated examples are correct, and even incorrect examples often contain valuable data for instruction tuning. The authors also fine-tune an 11 billion-parameter T6 model on Unnatural Instructions and show that the model can outperform both T0 and Tk-instruct across several benchmarks. The authors conclude that Unnatural Instructions is a dataset of instructions for a wide variety natural language tasks, collected in a completely automatic process requiring only a seed of manually constructed examples. The dataset highlights the ability of language models to produce creative, diverse, and accurate data, which is difficult to obtain with human annotations.</sample>

The authors propose a grouped head attention model that uses a divide and conquer strategy to compress multi-headed attention. The model consists of two stages: group-constrained training, which divides attention heads into groups to make intra-group heads more similar and inter-group heads more separate, and the Voting-to-Stay algorithm, which prunes redundant multi-head attention and retains only one head for each group. The model achieves significant parameter compression, with up to 90% of parameters pruned, while maintaining comparable performance. The model is evaluated on three tasks: machine translation, language modeling, and abstract summarization, and achieves improvements of 3.8%, 2.8%, and 6.7% over the state-of-the-art baselines, respectively. The authors also conduct efficiency analysis and show that the model achieves 90% of pruned parameter, 62% faster inference speed,</sample>

    <sample id="118">In this work, we address the challenge of improving pretraining techniques for code-switched natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Code-switching, a common linguistic phenomenon in diverse communities like India, involves the mixing of two or more languages within a single sentence. Traditional multilingual pre-trained models, such as mBERT and XLM-R, struggle with code-switched tasks like question answering and sentiment classification. To tackle this, we introduce SwitchMLM, a novel masked language model (MLM) technique tailored for code-switching. SwitchMLM identifies switch-points, which are transitions between languages, and masks only these points, unlike standard MLM that masks all words uniformly. However, this requires access to language identification (LID) tagged datasets, which may not always be available. To address this, we propose FrequencyMLM, a surrogate method that uses negative log likelihoods from monolingual corpora to infer LID tags. Additionally, we enhance the model with residual connections from intermediate layers to the final layer, which are more informative about switch-points, and an auxiliary LID-based loss to encourage the model to learn more language-specific information. Our experiments show that the combined approach of FrequencyMLM, residual connections, and auxiliary loss significantly improves performance on sentiment analysis tasks across various language pairs. Probing experiments using linear and conditional probing confirm that our methods increase the amount of switch-point and language information in the model's intermediate and final layers. In summary, SwitchMLM represents a significant advancement in handling code-switching in NLP, offering a robust solution for multilingual applications.</sample>

They address the discrepancy in the availability of instructional datasets between NLP (Natural Language Processing) and multi-modal tasks, and build a dataset consisting of 62 diverse multi-modal tasks covering ten broad categories. They use the OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained language model, as their base model and formulate all tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format, where input text, images, instructions, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token. They train the model using 53 tasks from nine groups and evaluate it on 10,000 instances per test task. They introduce a new evaluation metric called sensitivity, which measures the model's ability to consistently produce the correct outputs for the same task regardless of the slight variations in the wording of the instruction. The results show that instruction tuning can significantly improve the performance of the OFA model on seen multi-modal tasks, and transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can benefit instruction tuning. They also propose a new metric called sensitivity and design a new fine-tuning strategy to improve the model's sensitivity. They collect a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 vision-language tasks and release it.</sample>

They propose the TempReason dataset, which covers all levels and long temporal coverage, and evaluate temporal reasoning in three QA settings: closed book, open book, and reasoning QA.

    <sample id="127">This paper presents a novel approach to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models to smaller models using chain-of-thought prompting and diverse reasoning. The authors propose using large models to generate step-by-step solutions for tasks, which are then used as training data to fine-tune smaller models. The diverse reasoning technique involves generating multiple solutions using stochastic temperature sampling, which improves the performance of the student model. The authors compare their method with existing baselines on 12 benchmark tasks and show that their method achieves notable performance in many tasks, especially for text-based ones. They also demonstrate that their method is highly scalable and can be further improved by scaling the student performance through more datasets, better teacher models, or bigger student models. The paper concludes that simple distillation can transfer reasoning abilities from very large teachers to small students and that their method with diverse reasoning is an effective and highly scalable approach.</sample>

The results show that many coreference resolution models appear unable to reason about knowledge from different sources without task-specific training. With task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge, but even the best-performing models have difficulties with reliably integrating backward knowledge presented only inferential-time. The KITMUS test suite provides a diagnostic tool for evaluating the ability of natural language understanding models to integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>

FERMAT focuses on arithmetic types, number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency, providing a more comprehensive assessment of models' mathematical abilities. The authors conducted a baseline evaluation, finding poor performance across all aspects, and then fine-tuned models using generated templates, resulting in improved performance.

Finally, they explored the impact of training templates, demonstrating that language and mathematical diversity is essential for improving performance. The study concludes that FERMAT provides a more informative alternative to current benchmarks, highlighting the importance of language and mathematical diversity, as well as number encoding and tokenization, in evaluating numerical reasoning models.</sample>
    <sample id="137">Sicong from the Singapore University of Technology and Design presents "Tell2Design," a dataset and model for language-guided floor plan generation. Traditional text-conditional image models excel in generating realistic artwork but struggle with meeting specific design requirements. Tell2Design addresses this gap by enabling users to generate floor plans directly from natural language instructions, focusing on semantics, geometry, and topology. The dataset, comprising 5,051 human-annotATED and 76,000 artificially generated instructions, presents unique challenges: stricter constraints, understanding document-level unstructured text, and handling ambiguous instructions. The proposed sequence-to-sequence model, initialized with a pre-trained language model, treats instructions as input and room bounding boxes as the target sequence. Evaluated on unseen instructions, the model achieves high IoU scores, outperforming text-conditional image generation baselines. Training on artificial instructions before human ones improves performance, indicating a beneficial language distribution gap. The study highlights the potential of language-guided design generation and introduces Tell2Design as a foundational resource for future research.</sample>

    <sample id="146">This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the omission problem in dialogue summarization, a critical issue affecting the quality of generated summaries. Despite significant advancements in dialogue summarization using large-scale pretrained language models, these models often produce summaries with factual errors, primarily due to omission. The authors analyze the omission rate across five domains and six pre-trained models, finding that even state-of-the-art models have a high omission rate of about 70%. The study also reveals that omitted information is randomly distributed across dialogues, making it challenging for current models to identify key information. To address this, the authors construct the OLDS dataset, providing high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. They explore three frameworks as baselines for omission detection and evaluate their performance using Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The results show that the task is challenging, with an F1-score around 50%. The authors also investigate the impact of using omissions to refine summaries, finding that the performance is significantly improved when omission content is provided. This suggests that omission detection is a valuable task and that refinement based on detected omission is a promising direction for improving dialogue summarization quality.</sample>

The answers can be multi-span, multi-speaker, or rhetorical. The dataset is challenging for existing QA models in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings. The authors introduce a variety of methods, including context-retrieval, single-span models, and multi-span models, and show that silver data augmentation can improve zero-shot performance. The results show that models struggle to identify rhetorical questions, which are common in meeting transcripts. The authors also show that multi-span models have slightly less or comparable accuracy than single-span models. The MeetingQA dataset is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of NLP and can help advance the development of QA models for real-life meeting scenarios.</sample>

They benchmarked their models using Universal Dependencies treebanks for Greek and EvaLatina 2022 for Latin, focusing on part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, lemmatization, and semantic and world knowledge tasks. The results show significant improvements over existing models, with encoder-decoder models excelling in lemmatization. While multilingual models do not show a significant advantage over monolingual ones, the introduction of a high-quality pre-training dataset and the exploration of different model architectures mark a substantial advancement in the field of classical philology.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Ninareh Mehrabi presents her work on resolving ambiguities in text-to-image generative models. The study focuses on understanding and addressing ambiguities in prompts provided to these models, which can lead to inconsistent image generation. The research involves curating a benchmark dataset that covers various types of ambiguities and developing a framework to disambiguate prompts using either clarifying questions or visual setups. The disambiguated prompts are then evaluated using an automatic framework that compares the generated images to human intentions, assessed through a VQA model. The findings indicate that disambiguation improves the faithfulness of image generation and that the automatic evaluation aligns with human judgment. The study concludes that addressing ambiguities in prompts is crucial for generating images that accurately reflect user intentions.</sample>

    <sample id="157">Dialogue summarization aims to distill the salient information from a dialogue context into a brief summary. Existing methods rely on pre-computed static graph structures using external linguistic tools, which can be unreliable and inflexible. Our proposed SDDS model addresses these limitations by employing an Utterance Encoder to encode dialogue utterances into vector representations, a Static-Dynamic Graph module to capture semantic relationships between utterances, and a pre-trained language model as the Summary Generator. The model uses heuristic methods to build static dialogue structures, such as Discourse Parsing Graph and speaker interaction frequency matrix, and a dynamic graph module to calculate relationships between utterances using multi-head attention. The static and dynamic graphs are fused using a 1x1 convolutional layer and a graph attention layer, incorporating the dialogue structure information into the generation process. The SDDS model has been released on GitHub, and the code and data are available for download.</sample>
    <sample id="158">Coreference resolution is the task of identifying and clustering mentions of the same entity in a document. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity, while cache-based methods reduce complexity to linear levels. However, in long documents, the LRU eviction policy used in cache-based methods can lead to high cache misses. To address this, we propose a dual cache that uses a local cache with LRU eviction and a global cache with LFU eviction. The dual cache works by classifying mentions as new or existing, evaluating their frequency, and adding them to the appropriate cache. We evaluate the dual cache on four public benchmarks and find that it outperforms single cache methods and reduces cache misses. We also show that dual cache is the most cost-effective compared to single cache methods. In conclusion, dual cache uses a local and global cache separately to store local and global entities, and it outperforms single cache methods and largely reduces cache misses.</sample>

    <sample id="164">Weakly supervised learning (WSL) offers the benefit of training neural networks on data that is less expensive to label than fully supervised data. This is achieved by using weak labeling sources such as heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low-quality crowd-sourcing. WSL aims to train models that can generalize well despite the noise in the weak labels. The key advantage is that it reduces the cost of data annotation while still enabling the development of robust models. However, it is important to note that WSL approaches often require clean validation samples to work effectively, and the performance of these methods can be significantly improved by fine-tuning on clean data.</sample>
    <sample id="165">In this paper, we introduce LiPoR, an unsupervised learning method for abductive reasoning that leverages the mutual exclusivity of explanations. Abductive reasoning involves identifying plausible explanations that bridge the gap between a given context and an outcome. Traditional approaches rely on supervised methods, which require annotated plausible explanations, often leading to noisy and subjective annotations. Our method, LiPoR, treats explanations as latent variables and maximizes the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context, without prior knowledge of plausible explanations. To address the issue of preferring plausible explanations, we introduce a regularizer based on the mutual exclusivity of explanations. This regularizer enforces that explanations cannot be both true simultaneously, and if one explanation is true, it rules out the others. Our method outperforms zero-shot models and the previous best unsupervised approach on the AlphaNLI dataset, achieving over 4 absolute points in accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="166">Yunxin from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, presents a novel approach to image retrieval from linguistically complex text, leveraging a Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Framework. This task is challenging due to the high similarity of images and lengthy descriptions. Traditional visual language models excel in image-sentence retrieval but struggle with complex reasoning. Inspired by the Divide-and-Conquer strategy and Dual Process Theory, the proposed method decomposes complex propositions into simpler ones using a Proposition Generator. The Visual-Linguistic Interactor (System 1) performs visual-proposition interaction, while the Neural-Symbolic Reasoner (System 2) integrates reasoning states for final solutions. The system combines analogical inference (System 1) and logical reasoning (System 2) to enhance performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines, with ablation studies validating module effectiveness. Two cases demonstrate the method's ability to present inference states and results, indicating interoperable processing. The study suggests that neural symbolic calculation and Divide-and-Conquer strategies, combined with Dual Process Theory, are promising for improving compositional reasoning in large language models.</sample>

The dataset contains 35,000 argument-analysis pairs, with 85% sourced from high-quality debaters and 15% from novice debaters. The dataset covers 24 themes, providing a diverse range of motions and arguments.

    <sample id="179">This research presents SymbolicToM, an inference-time method designed to enhance Theory of Mind reasoning skills in large language models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs struggle with false-belief tasks, which require understanding the mental states of multiple characters. SymbolicToM addresses this by using explicit graphical representations to model the beliefs of various characters, allowing for efficient question answering. The method computes graphical representations for all combinations of characters up to a predefined Theory of Mind level, leveraging off-the-shelf natural language inference (NLI) and open information extraction (OpenIE) models. Experiments show that SymbolicToM significantly improves the performance of LLMs like GPT-3 and Macaw across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including those designed to test storage structure and linguistic generalization. The approach avoids overfitting and provides more interpretable reasoning, making it a promising tool for advancing Theory of Mind capabilities in LLMs.</sample>

    <sample id="181">In this paper, we introduce the problem of constrained language planning, which involves planning for goals with specific constraints, such as making a chocolate cake. We evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and find that they achieve unsatisfactory results. We conduct a detailed analysis and find that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable, but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed due to high variance in the output quality of language models. To address this issue, we adopt the idea of over-generate then filter, where we first show constraint types with examples for InstructGPT, obtain specific goals based on the seed abstract goals, and then InstructGPT over-generates K scripts for specific targets. A filter model is developed to select the faithful scripts, and we reward the script that contains the keywords of target constraints. With our method, InstructGPT can generate higher quality scripts. We also create a dataset of constrained language planning, named as "CoScript", by distilling constrained language planning datasets from large language models. CoScript shows high pluralism in the generated goals, and we find that T5 fine-tuned on CoScrip can generate scripts of higher quality than most large models. In summary, we establish the constrained language problem, evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language model, and develop an over-generate then filter method for large language model. We use large language model to generate a high-quality script dataset, CoScrip, for constrained language planning. We hope the dataset can be a valuable resource to advance research in language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="192">The presentation introduces "CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimizer," a novel approach to optimize large language models with both fast convergence and low memory usage. Traditional adaptive gradient-based methods like Adam require significant memory for storing gradient moments, while memory-efficient optimizers like Adafactor reduce memory but at the cost of slower convergence and potential instability. CAME addresses these challenges by incorporating a confidence-guided mechanism to adaptively adjust updates based on the residual between predicted and actual updates, inspired by the erroneous updates observed in Adafactor. Experiments on datasets like BookCorpus and English Wikipedia, and training tasks for models like BERT, GPT-2, and T6, demonstrate that CAME significantly improves validation accuracy and performance compared to Adam and Adafactor. Notably, CAME reduces memory usage by up to 3.4% in validation accuracy and outperforms Adam in pre-training large models with reduced memory costs. The optimizer's effectiveness is further validated by its ability to handle large batch training, making it a valuable extension for existing memory-efficient optimizers.</sample>

    <sample id="195">This paper introduces a novel framework, Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (RoHT), for explainable question answering (XQA). XQA aims to provide answers to questions along with explanations for the selection of those answers. Traditional XQA methods fall into two categories: neuro-symbolic methods, which translate questions into formal representations like SPARQL, and decompose-based methods, generating natural language intermediate steps. However, these methods have limitations, such as incomplete knowledge bases and difficulties in handling diverse natural language.

RoHT addresses these challenges by integrating knowledge from heterogeneous sources through question decomposition. The framework consists of two stages: building a Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT) to understand the compositional structure of complex questions and performing probabilistic reasoning over the HQDT to fuse knowledge from a knowledge base and a text corpus. The HQDT is constructed by decomposing a complex question into atomic questions and intermediate questions, with each node assigned a certainty score.

RoHT evaluates the HQDT using probabilistic reasoning, selecting appropriate knowledge sources for each node and aggregating candidate answers to output the top key answers. The framework is tested on two challenging datasets, KQA Pro and Musique. On KQA Pro, RoHT outperforms existing KB QA methods by integrating answers from sub-questions of different levels. When Wikipedia is added as a supplementary text corpus, RoHT shows substantial improvement over RoHT KB, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining KB and text knowledge. On Musique, RoHT-text improves F1 by 11.9% compared to the SOTA method EX(SA), and RoHT-mix outperforms TransferNet, showing the superiority of explicit decomposition.

In summary, RoHT provides a promising approach for XQA by leveraging hierarchical question decomposition and probabilistic reasoning to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources, achieving significant improvements in complex question answering.</sample>

    <sample id="205">This presentation, by Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, explores the political biases in language models and their impact on downstream tasks. Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which often includes diverse political perspectives, leading to potential fairness issues. The study investigates the political bias propagation pipeline from pretraining data, language models, to downstream tasks. Key findings include:

1. Language models exhibit varying political leanings, with GPT-4 being the most liberal.
2. Pretraining on partisan corpora shifts the ideological coordinates of language models, reflecting societal polarization.
3. Language models with different political leanings perform differently on hate speech and fake news detection tasks, often favoring their own political perspective.

The study highlights the fairness issues arising from language model political biases, emphasizing the need to address this pressing concern. The unique dilemma is between sanitizing political opinions in training data, which risks censorship, and allowing biases to propagate, leading to unfairness. This presents a challenging decision, akin to the electric trolley problem, where the consequences of inaction or action are significant.</sample>

    <sample id="215">This paper presents a novel argument for symmetric structures of coordination, challenging the asymmetric approaches in dependency structures. The authors propose that the principle of dependency length minimization, which favors shorter dependencies, explains the preference for shorter left conjuncts in coordination structures. They analyze the Penn Treebank and find that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, especially when the governor is on the left or absent, and the difference in length between the conjuncts is larger. This tendency disappears when the governor is on the right. The authors demonstrate that this principle provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination and supports symmetric structures. They also show that this effect is observed when measuring length in characters, syllables, and words, with the right column showing the strongest evidence. The paper concludes that the principle of dependency length minimization offers a novel perspective on the structure of coordination and challenges the traditional asymmetric approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="217">In this work, we address the challenge of generating controllable dialogue with multiple attributes, a task that previous methods have struggled with due to their focus on single attributes and reliance on annotated data. We introduce Disentangled Controllable Generation (DCG), a novel approach that learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses disentanglement loss to separate different attribute combinations. Our unified reference-free evaluation framework, MAE, allows for the assessment of different granularities of attributes without the need for additional labeled data. We establish two benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our method and evaluation metrics. Our models, based on the DialoGPT framework, utilize compositional prompts to effectively guide the model's focus on specific information. We design two types of prompts—attribute-oriented and task-oriented—to capture both instance-specific and global features. A disentanglement loss is introduced to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between different attribute value combinations. Our results show that DCG outperforms existing baselines in attribute controllability and text quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for transforming seen attributes into unseen combinations. We also show that our method can disentangle attribute combinations, learn the relations between different attributes, and generalize from seen to unseen combinations.</sample>

    <sample id="219">This work presents a compare-and-contrast multistage pipeline for uncovering financial signals in financial reports, specifically focusing on the Form 10-K annual reports required by the SEC. The authors observed that the text in these reports is highly similar, with about 80% of tokens being the same, and that the content is year-dependent. To address the challenge of mining useful information from these reports, they introduced a highlighting task and a multi-stage pipeline. The pipeline consists of document segmentation, relation recognition, and out-of-domain and in-domain fine-tuning. The authors classified all pairs into three types: Type β (highly similar), revised pairs (similar syntactical patterns but different meanings), and mismatched pairs (new information or operations). They used an external dataset (eSNLI) for out-of-domain fine-tuning and mixed objectives to alleviate the problem of low-quality pseudo-labels during intermediate fine-tuning. The evaluation dataset included eSNLI pairs and the authors' released FINAL dataset, using precision and PCC as metrics. The results showed that their domain-adaptive highlighting model achieved the best overall performance and preserved generalization capability. The authors also observed that their methods could benefit from simulation with mismatched pairs, which were not used during training. They proposed a highlighting task with their released FINAL dataset and a simple pipeline with two stages of fine-tuning, and suggested future work to improve effectiveness or add more features.</sample>

    <sample id="227">Grounded language understanding, which involves mapping natural language expressions to specific environments or plans, is a challenging task for language models due to the lack of grounding during pre-training. Existing research typically uses language models to generate plans via autoregressive decoding, but this can result in grammatical or invalid plans. Our proposed framework, named Pangu, separates the newer world of language models from the symbolic world of plans, allowing language models to focus on discrimination rather than generation. In our framework, a symbolic agent proposes candidate plans, and a language model scores and ranks them. We demonstrate that Pangu achieves outstanding performance across different settings, including fine-tuning and in-context learning, and shows strong sample efficiency and robustness under non-i.i.d. settings. Our findings suggest that discrimination may be a better strategy for grounded language understanding than generation. We welcome discussions and collaborations on this topic.</sample>

They introduce two tasks: Suboptimal-Claim detection, which determines if a claim needs revisions, and Claim Improvement Suggestion, which identifies quality issues to be addressed. The authors explore the challenges of using revision-based data from collaborative online debate platforms like Kialo, focusing on argumentative text. They address four main challenges: Representativity and Reliability, Model Complexity and Architecture, Contextual Information, and Topical and User Bias. The study finds that revision-based data can be effectively used for the tasks, with modeling the distance between claim versions being beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims. The impact of contextual information depends on the task and the quality issues present. The authors invite readers to refer to their paper for a detailed analysis of strategies and approaches for the introduced tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="233">Simultaneous speech translation (SimulST) is the process of translating spoken language into text in real-time, enabling cross-language communication. However, current SimulST models face challenges such as long and complicated training procedures, multiple models for different latency regimes, and the need for specific architectures. To address these issues, the authors propose EDAtt (Encoder-Decoder Attention), a strategy that uses existing offline speech translation (ST) models without re-training or adopting specific architectures for SimulST. EDAtt leverages the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output to decide whether to emit a partial translation based on where attention points. The authors compare EDAtt with popular strategies such as Wait-k and Local Agreement, as well as the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for SimulST. The results show that EDAtt outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models and is the fastest strategy when considering the actual elapsed time or computational-aware time. The authors also released open-source code and models to facilitate the reproducibility of their work.</sample>

When using five-shot prompting, there is nearly no difference in the actual form of the prompting, and the examples carry most of the weight.

The dataset statistics show the number of meetings, duration, tokens, speakers, and year period for each city. The dataset also provides summarization instances for each city, average number of sentences and tokens, and coverage and density scores for each summary. The dataset is evaluated using top-tier summarization systems, including extractive and abstractive models, and human evaluation. The results show that GPT-3 achieves the highest overall scores in terms of fluency and coherence, but less impressive in informativeness and factuality. The primary contribution of MeetingBank is the creation of a benchmark dataset for meeting summarization, which serves as a useful tool for researchers and provides insights into the decision-making process of City Council meetings.</sample>
    <sample id="241">Ethan presents a paper titled "Human-in-the-loop Evaluation for Early Misinfomation Detection: A Case Study of COVID-10 Treatments." The paper discusses the limitations of existing automatic misinformation detection systems, which are often evaluated using retrospectively constructed datasets and do not involve human content moderators. The authors propose an evaluation framework that addresses these deficiencies by involving humans at various stages of the process. The framework consists of two main components: the detection of misleading claims and the verification of policy violations. The system takes raw tweets as input and outputs check-worthy claims, which are then ranked by trendiness and provided to humans for verification. The second component uses a BERT-based stance classification model to determine the author's stance towards unapproved treatments, which are then flagged for human review. The authors evaluate the efficacy of the system by operationalizing early detection as the detection of an unapproved treat before its first appearance in a debunking news article. They find that the system has a position of 65% in policy violation detection and can detect 124.2 policy violations per human hour worked. The authors conclude that their framework more realistically captures the complex interplay between systems</sample>
    <sample id="242">Common evaluation methods for dialogue systems include:

1. Human evaluation: asking human judges to select which of two conversations they prefer or to rate conversations on a Likert scale.
2. Likert ratings on the turn-level: evaluating the quality of each turn in a conversation on a Likert scale.
3. Likert ratings on the dialogue-level: evaluating the overall quality of a conversation on a Likert scale.
4. Dialogue-level pairwise comparisons: comparing the quality of two conversations and determining which one is better.

These methods are used to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality, such as relevance, coherence, and empathy. However, they can be subjective and may not capture all aspects of chat quality.</sample>

    <sample id="245">This work presents a pipeline for identifying high-agreement workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for summarization tasks. The pipeline consists of pre-task qualifications, a qualification task, an endurance task, and a reference-based task. The pre-task qualifications include location, number of Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), and HIT Approval Rate. The qualification task tests the annotator's ability to evaluate multiple summary dimensions, and the endurance task tests their capacity for handling a heavy workload. The reference-based task is designed to test the general performance on the true summary task. The pipeline results in 4 gold and 8 gold workers, which is 6% out of the 200 participants. The pipeline can avoid resource waste on discarded annotations and achieve high agreement at a lower cost. The pipeline results are similar to those of CloudResearch MTurk workers. The pipeline can be used for tasks, languages, and platforms, and future work will investigate ways to hire high-quality workers. The limitations of the work include testing only English summarization on the MTurk platform, the designed questions not being a "panacea" solution, and no guarantee for the training of correctness.</sample>

    <sample id="247">We introduce FactKG, a new dataset for fact verification via reasoning on knowledge graphs. Unlike existing datasets that use text or tables as evidence, FactKG utilizes knowledge graphs, such as DBpedia, to verify claims. The dataset includes claims in both written and colloquial styles, with two labels: SUPPORTED and REFUTED, and five types of reasoning: one-hop, conjunction (multiple one-hop claims), existence (entity connected to a specific relation), multi-hop (path from one entity to another), and negation (additional inference required for negation). We propose two methods for handling colloquial style claims: a colloquial style transfer model and presupposition templates. We evaluate our dataset using baselines that use only claims or correct evidence, and our GEAR model that uses graph evidence outperforms all baselines. FactKG can be used in all tasks that require a check of consistency between knowledge graphs and natural language, such as modern dialogue systems.</sample>

    <sample id="252">This presentation introduces "U-CREAT: Unsupervised Case RetrievaL using Events extrAcTion," a joint work by Sai Kiran Tanikella, Abhinav Joshi, Akshat, Sharma, and Ashutosh Modi. The project addresses the challenge faced by legal professionals in retrieving relevant past precedents, known as cited documents, due to the increasing volume of cases. The key contributions of this work are the IL-PCR dataset and the U-CREATE pipeline. The IL-PCR dataset is a new benchmark for Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) tasks, consisting of 7,070 legal cases from India with an average of 6.775 citations per query document. The U-CREATE pipeline leverages unsupervised learning and an event-based approach to PCR tasks, demonstrating high retrieval efficiency, low inference time, and generalizability across Indian and Canadian legal systems. The pipeline uses dependency parsing to extract events from legal documents, forming subject-verb-object triplets, and computes an interaction matrix between query and candidate events to rank the candidates. The experiments conducted with diverse models, including count-based, transformer-based, and event-based models, show that event-based models, particularly the Event Filtered Documents model, outperform all other methods with significant improvements in performance and inference time. The U-CREATE approach is currently the state-of-the-art method for the COLI EE’21 document retrieval task.</sample>
    <sample id="253">DisorBERT is a double domain adaptation model designed to detect signs of mental disorders in social media posts. Mental disorders are psychological syndromes associated with distress and disability that affect thinking, feeling, mood, and behavior. Social media content is vast and provides an opportunity to research how people experience difficulties. DisorBERT aims to contribute to the detection of mental health disorders through automatic analysis of social media posts. Domain adaptation is used to improve the performance of a model on a specific target domain by leveraging knowledge from a related domain. DisorBERT uses a base language model and integrates information from Reddit and mental health, guided by a lexicon. The model learns the social media language and specializes in the mental disorder domain. The results show that DisorBERT has a good balance between precision and recall, and it tends to focus on important words during the training process, such as those related to mental disorders. The model also generates more negative and psychological-oriented answers compared to BERT. The most important sequences of the text are visualized using a graph, showing that the most prominent words are related to depression. In conclusion, the combined effect of double domain adaptation and guide masking is effective at capturing signs of mental disorders on social media. Future work includes exploring the application of different lexical resources and using clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="254">In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for document-level distant relation extraction (DocRE) that addresses the issue of noise in distant supervision data. Traditional DocRE methods rely on large-scale human-annotated corpora, but recent approaches have shifted to using distantly supervised data to improve performance. However, these data often contain various levels of noise, which can lead to false-positive pseudo labels and incorrect relation extraction. To mitigate this problem, we propose a document-level relation distant extraction (DRE) framework with uncertainty-guided label denoising.

Our framework first trains a pre-denoising DocRE model using both distant supervision (DS) and human-annotated data to generate pseudo labels. We then introduce uncertainty estimation to determine the trustworthiness of model predictions. For overlapping relations, we propose an instance-level uncertainty estimation method and a re-labeling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty threshold to filter out low-quality pseudo labels.

To model the uncertainty in the pre-denoising DocRE model, we use Monte Carlo dropout technology, which requires multiple stochastic forward-pass predictions with activated dropout. We observe that the distribution of uncertainty scores for each relation class is different, and frequent classes usually have lower average uncertainty than long-tail classes. We propose dynamic class uncertainty thresholds to filter out pseudo labels with high uncertainty.

Finally, we design a multi-phase training strategy to iterate re-labeling the DS data, which further boosts the performance of the DocRE model. Our framework outperforms several strong baselines on public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The main contributions of our work are the uncertainty-guided label denoising framework, instance-level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations, dynamic class uncertainty thresholds for the long-tail problem, and significant performance improvements.</sample>

    <sample id="258">This video presents a novel approach to evaluating the quality of text in natural language processing using large language models. The authors propose using natural language instructions to instruct the large language models, which can understand the instructions and provide ratings through their output. The motivation behind this work is to find an alternative to human evaluation, which is unstable and hard to reproduce. The authors conducted an experiment using large language model evaluation to rate stories generated by GPT-2 or written by humans, based on four attributes: grammar, coherence, likeability, and relevance. The results showed that human raters prefer human-written stories over GPT-2-written stories, and some large language models, such as Davinci and ChatGPT, showed a clear preference toward human-written text. The authors also discuss the benefits and costs of using large language model evaluation compared to human evaluation and present results on other tasks. The video concludes with a call to action for interested viewers to read the paper or visit the poster stand at ACL.</sample>
    <sample id="259">Yusen Zhang from Penn State University presents their work "XSemPLR: Cross-Linguistic Semantic Parsing in Multiple Natural Languages and Meaning Representation." Semantic parsing involves translating user queries into structured representations like SQL or Lambda Calculus. Traditional cross-lingual models are limited in scope, often focusing on specific languages or meaning representations. XSemPLR addresses these gaps by providing a comprehensive benchmark with 9 datasets across 22 languages and 8 meaning representations. The benchmark evaluates six settings: Translate-Test, Monolingual Model, Monolingual Few-shot, Multilingual Model, Cross-lingual Zero-shot, and Cross-lingual Few-shot transfer.

The study finds that Encoder-Decoder models outperform Encoder-PTR models across all datasets. Training in a mixture of languages improves performance, though English performance drops in seven datasets. The Cross-lingual Few-shot transfer setting shows significant performance gains compared to Zero-shot transfer. Pretraining on English boosts Few-shot performance, and multilingual models like Codex and BLOOM are inadequate for these tasks.

XSemPLR offers a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsers, revealing key insights into multilingual model performance and the challenges of cross-lingual transfer.</sample>

    <sample id="263">In this work, we address the issue of label biases in in-context learning, a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models. We identify a new type of bias, domain-label bias, which arises from the task corpus and affects the model's predictions. We propose a novel calibration method, domain-context calibration, to handle all types of biases in a holistic fashion. This method uses random in-domain words sampled from the task Corpus as content-free text to estimate the model's bias and calibrate the original predictions. We conduct experiments on a wide range of datasets and find that domain-context calibration significantly improves the average performance of in-context learning, especially on tasks with larger domain-label bias. Our findings hold for larger models like GPT-3. We also conduct comprehensive calibration studies to understand why domain-context calibration is better than previous attempts. In summary, we provide a systematic investigation of label bias problems in in-context learning and propose a calibration method that significantly improves the performance of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="264">Lin Wang's presentation introduces "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Virtual Text Generation," addressing the challenges in multimodal text generation due to data annotation difficulties and domain shifts. Traditional models struggle with varying conditions across domains, leading to performance degradation. TAVT proposes a novel task focusing on multi-modal domain shifts, such as visual style and audio energy. The framework consists of three components: an audio-visual meta mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model, and counterfactual contrastive learning.

The meta mapper network maps visual concepts into a unified auditory semantic space, using learnable tokens (visual prefixes) to improve audio reconstruction. The transformer-based encoder and generator evaluate the contribution of different modalities, with a loss function and training details. Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCCL) optimizes visual-audio alignment without relying on negative samples.

Experiments on MSVD and MSR-VTT benchmarks show TAVT outperforms state-of-the-art models in both cross-datasets and cross-domain settings. TAVT maintains performance in low-resource domains with limited labeled data, unlike other methods. Ablation experiments highlight the importance of audio features in enhancing performance.</sample>

    <sample id="280">This paper introduces MultiEMO, a novel attention-based correlation-aware multimodal fusion (ERC) framework for emotion recognition in conversations. ERC aims to predict the emotion label of each utterance in a dialogue, considering textual, audio, and visual modalities. Existing methods often fail to exploit the complementarity of multimodal information and struggle with minority and semantically similar emotion classes. MultiEMO addresses these challenges through four key components: unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion using a novel MultiAttn model, and emotion classification. The framework includes VisExtNet, a visual feature extractor that captures facial expressions without redundant scene information, and a Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive Loss to improve classification of minority and semantically similar emotions. Extensive experiments on MELD and IEMOC AP datasets demonstrate that MultiEMO achieves state-of-the-the-art performance, significantly improving minority and semantically similar emotion recognition. However, limitations include VisExtNet's inability to distinguish between speakers and irrelevant people, the need for a large batch size for the SWFC loss, and still inferior performance in minority emotions compared to majority classes.</sample>
    <sample id="281">Kayo Yin and colleagues present a study on the importance of context in translation, particularly in multilingual settings. They introduce CXMI, a measure of context usage by machine translation models, and extend it to Pointwise CXMI for sentence and word-level analysis. By analyzing TED talk transcripts translated into 14 languages, they identify patterns in words with high P-CXMI, such as dual pronouns in Arabic and proper nouns in Chinese, which require context for accurate translation. They also examine the role of context in verb forms and formality. Using these findings, they develop the Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) tagger to identify discourse phenomena in parallel corpora. Evaluating models with MuDA, they find that context-aware models outperform context-agnostic ones for certain phenomena like formality and lexical cohesion, but not for others like ellipsis and pronouns. They also compare commercial systems, finding that DeepL is generally more accurate than Google Translate for document-level translation, highlighting the need for further progress in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="282">Xuekai Zhu presents their work at ACL 2023, titled "StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancers." This research addresses the challenge of non-parallel text style transfer at the story level, focusing on discourse-level imitation of author style. The primary challenge involves capturing complex author linguistic preferences, such as narrative techniques and discourse structures, which are highly associated with specific writing topics. To tackle this, StoryTrans employs a novel generation model that learns discourse representations and combines them with learnable style embeddings. The model uses a two-stage training framework: the first stage involves an advisory training process with self-reconstruction, disentanglement, and sentence order losses to disentangle style and content; the second stage focuses on filling in style-specific content and removing masks. StoryTrans was evaluated on new datasets in Chinese and English, showing superior performance in style control and content preservation compared to baselines. The model also aligns with golden text in style feature space and can enrich storylines with relevant phrases. StoryTrans effectively rewrites sentences with the target style while maintaining source semantics. The work is accompanied by datasets and code available in the repository.</sample>

    <sample id="284">In this paper, we introduce FSUIE, a novel fuzzy span mechanism designed to enhance universal information extraction (UIE) models. Traditional UIE models rely heavily on precise span boundary annotations, which can be ambiguous. FSUIE addresses this by modeling span boundaries as continuous distributions rather than fixed points, allowing for more flexible and accurate predictions. The model uses an adaptive attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the span of attention based on the target's length, represented by a fuzzy span attention mask. This mask introduces an optimizable parameter to control the span length and ensures that attention decays linearly at the boundaries, rather than truncating. FSUIE is evaluated across three main UIE tasks: named entity recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction. On NER, FSUIE significantly outperforms baseline models, especially on smaller datasets. For relationship extraction, FSUIE achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different domains. On aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE), FSUIE also sets new benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the fuzzy span loss and attention mechanism, showing that they improve convergence speed and information extraction capability. Visualizations of attention distributions reveal that the model focuses on relevant semantic information within a limited range, aligning with our expectations. In summary, FSUIE introduces a novel approach to UIE by leveraging fuzzy spans and adaptive attention, achieving superior performance across various tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="285">Mingqi Gao from Peking University presents their work on "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation framework." The study addresses the issue of factual errors in dialogue summarization, which can be tackled by either incorporating factuality-related objectives in the training or inference of summarization models or by designing a separate Factual Error Correction (FEC) model. Gao et al. argue that current evaluation methods for FEC models, which rely on factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE, are flawed as they provide vague overall scores and blur the line between the two types of solutions. To address these issues, they propose introducing manually annotated reference corrections for more accurate evaluation and propose a new taxonomy of factual errors. The evaluation framework, based on ERRANT, consists of alignment, classification, and comparison steps. The study finds that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue summarizations datasets yields the best results, and there is a need to change evaluation methods. Introducing human-corrected summaries during training can improve performance, and combining human-annotated data with synthetic data is promising. However, current FEC models struggle with certain types of factual errors.</sample>

    <sample id="296">Valerio Basile presents a collaborative work between the University of Turin and Amazon Alexa, focusing on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project aims to develop more informative models for detecting irony, a complex and pragmatic phenomenon in language. Traditional NLU approaches rely on supervised machine learning with large datasets of manually annotated data. However, the assumption of a single truth (ground truth) is limited, prompting the team to investigate irony detection further.

The EPIC corpus, an English Perspectivist Irony Corpus, was created by collecting data from social media, Reddit, and Twitter over 1.5 years. The dataset includes 300 short conversations in five varieties of English, annotated by 74 annotators using Prolific. Each annotator reviewed 200 texts, with additional attention checks for quality control.

The team observed differences in inter-annotator agreement across various dimensions, such as gender, age, and nationality. They built perspective-aware models by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on dataset splits based on annotator characteristics. While raw performance showed no significant trends, perspective-aware models demonstrated higher confidence in predictions compared to gold standard aggregated models.

Further analysis revealed that age and geographical distribution of annotators influenced irony perception, with closer generations and annotators from the UK and Ireland showing more disagreement. The study concludes with a call for further discussion and questions at the poster session.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The project "From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns" explores the use of coded rhetoric, specifically dogwhistles, in political speech. Dogwhistles are terms that convey a hidden message to a specific in-group while being innocuous to the outgroup. The study develops a typology and glossary of over 340 dogwhistle terms, categorizing them by register, type, and persona. A case study of historical U.S. political speeches reveals a correlation between the frequency of racial dogwhistles and the Republican Southern Strategy, which used dogwhistles to avoid explicit racism. The research also evaluates the ability of language models, such as GPT-3, to recognize dogwhistles, finding that they perform better with formal dogwhistles and struggle with informal and transphobic ones. Additionally, the study demonstrates how dogwhistles can evade content moderation by showing that automated toxicity detection scores decrease when standard slurs are replaced with dogwhistles. The project highlights the importance of understanding dogwhistles in political influence and the challenges of detecting them in online discourse.</sample>
    <sample id="298">The findings that led to the conclusion that temporal drift is the main cause of performance loss include:

1. **Experiment with Retraining**: The researchers retrained or continued to pre-train some models with more recent Reuters News data from 2020. They observed that the performance of these models degraded with a larger temporal gap between the training and test data.

2. **Confirmation of Hypothesis**: This degradation in performance with a larger temporal gap confirmed their hypothesis that temporal drift is the main cause of the performance drop.

3. **Comparison with Adaptive Overfitting**: The researchers also noted that adaptive overfitting was not observed, as the gradient of the best fit line was greater than one, indicating that improvements on CoNLL-2003 translated to more than one unit improvement on CoNILL++.

These findings collectively led to the conclusion that temporal drift is the primary cause of the performance loss.</sample>
    <sample id="299">This work presents a novel training method to improve the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models against shortcuts, which are spurious correlations between input attributes and labels. The method, called minimax training, aims to reduce the reliance of NLI models on these shortcuts and enhance their out-of-distribution performance. The key idea is to obtain an example weight distribution that emphasizes under-represented hard examples, which are crucial for good generalization. The learner model tries to minimize the NLI task loss, while the auxiliary model maximizes the learner's loss by generating example weights that incentivize the learner to focus on high-loss ranges of the input space. Both models are optimized in an alternating fashion. The method does not assume any knowledge about the shortcuts in the dataset and relies on the learner's own training dynamics to model the auxiliary. The proposed method is evaluated on three commonly used analytic datasets and their corresponding out-of-distribution adversarial test sets, showing consistent improvements in out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-domain accuracy. The authors also examine the effect of pre-training the learner, the size of the auxiliary, and conduct a qualitative evaluation of the learned example weight.</sample>

The task is characterized by flexible interleaving of dictation and editing, using natural language utterances to specify edits, and not requiring a fixed set of template commands. The authors introduce a new task, interactive dictation, and design a data collection interface and build a dataset. They also create a baseline system for the task, which includes a separate model for each of the four steps: ASR recognition, segmentation, ASR repair, and interpretation. The authors experiment with two different architectures, T5 andGPT-3, and two different types of outputs, predicting programs or directly predicting the next state.

The authors also release code and welcome more work on this task.</sample>

    <sample id="305">Dawei and colleagues present their recent work on "Weaker Than You Think: A Critical View of Weakly Supervised Learning" at Saarland University. Weakly supervised learning involves training neural networks on data labeled with weak sources, such as heuristic rules or crowdsourcing, which are cheaper but noisy. The challenge is that these noisy labels can cause models to memorize errors and fail to generalize. The researchers address three key questions: whether clean validation data is necessary, how many clean samples are required, and how to best utilize them. They find that clean validation data is essential for effective weak supervision, and that increasing the number of clean samples improves performance. However, they also show that direct fine-tuning on clean data can outperform complex WSL methods. The researchers recommend reporting model selection criteria, comparing WSL with few-shot learning, and considering continuous fine-tuning as a baseline. They have open-sourced their code for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim explore the ability of pre-trained language models to track entities in discourse. They argue that understanding entity states is crucial for comprehending longer discourses, yet there is limited systematic investigation into this capability. The researchers designed an evaluation task involving boxes and objects to assess entity tracking abilities, ensuring that models cannot rely on shortcuts like memorization or simple heuristics. They tested the task with Flan-T5 and GPT-3 models using 2-shot in-context learning. The results showed that most models simply repeated the initial state, while only text-davinci-003 exhibited non-trivial tracking. Further analysis revealed that pre-training on code is responsible for enabling this capacity in models. Smaller models like T5-base can learn entity tracking through fine-tuning, but pre-training remains important. The study suggests that the observed state tracking abilities may not generalize beyond the task setup. The researchers invite further discussion and exploration of their findings, which are detailed in their paper available on arXiv.</sample>

The models were compared to six baseline models: CamemBERT OSCAR 138GB, CamemBERT OSCAR 4GB, CamemBERT CCNET 4GB, PubMedBERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBER. The evaluation highlighted that models performed best on tasks with data of the same nature as those on whom the model was trained, but data from heterogeneous sources appeared to be more versatile. Additionally, using more data generally resulted in better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="308">This presentation, by first-year PhD student Jenny, discusses the concept of positionality in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how it can lead to design biases in datasets and models. Positionality refers to the perspectives that people hold as a result of demographics, identity, and life experiences, and can influence research outcomes. The presentation introduces the NLPositionality framework, which compares annotations with real users to study model and dataset positionality. The framework was tested on two tasks: social acceptability and hate speech detection, using datasets and models such as GPT-4, Dynahate, and Perspective API. The study found that datasets and models are most aligned with English-speaking countries and people with a college education, but less aligned with non-binary individuals. The presentation concludes with recommendations for addressing positionality in NLP, including keeping records of design choices, conducting research with a perspectivist lens, and building specialized datasets and models within specific communities.</sample>

    <sample id="317">In this presentation, Peng Li from Fudan University introduces "CodeIE," a novel approach to information extraction using large code generation models. Information extraction, a classic NLP task, involves extracting structured information from unstructured text, such as named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). Traditional methods use pre-trained language models like T5 and GPT3, which operate in a text-to-text manner during pre-training but face challenges during inference due to mismatched outputs between plain text and structured formats.

To address this issue, CodeIE transforms the text-to-structured information extraction task into a structured-to-structured code generation task using code large language models like Codex. This approach ensures aligned structures in the output stage. For NER, a function is defined to extract named entities from input text, and few-shot in-context demonstrations are used to train the model. Similar prompts are designed for RE tasks.

The method was evaluated on three NER datasets and four RE datasets using models like T5, UIE, GPT-3, and Codex. The results showed that the proposed approach using code language models and code format queries significantly outperformed traditional baseline models. Detailed analysis revealed that code format inputs had lower perplexity, and Codex outperformed GPT-3 in information extraction tasks. Code format prompts also performed better in terms of recall.

The paper and code are publicly available, and the authors hope their analysis provides inspiration for future research in information extraction.</sample>
    <sample id="319">The work investigates several learning strategies, including:

2. **Continual pre-training**: Using pre-trained models as a starting point and fine-tuning them on specific tasks or datasets.
3. **Control pre-training**: Using the weights and tokenization of a pre-trained model (CamemBERT) trained on a subset of data (NACHOS) to initialize a new model.
4. **Comparison of pre-training settings and data sources**: Evaluating the performance of models trained on different datasets and pre-training strategies.

The study compares the performance of these strategies on various downstream tasks in the biomedical and clinical domains.</sample>
    <sample id="320">The factor of overfitting due to test reuse is indicated by the gradient of the best fit line being greater than one. This means that every unit improvement made on the CoNLL-2003 dataset translates to more than one unit improvement on the CoNLL++ dataset, suggesting that there is no diminishing returns and that adaptive overfitting is not observed in this case.</sample>
    <sample id="321">The quality of the simplification was evaluated by comparing the simplified sentences to their original complex counterparts using parallel sentence pairs from the DEPLAIN corpus. The evaluation included analyzing the type of simplification, such as lexical, structural, and overall simplification, and assessing the variety of simplification transformations. Additionally, the corpus was used as a gold standard to evaluate automatic alignment methods for parallel documents with the same content but different complexity levels. The best alignment method identified was MASSalign. Furthermore, the corpus was used to fine-tune language models for automatic text simplification, with the results showing that the fine-tuned models could produce simplified text with better scores than baseline models.</sample>
    <sample id="322">Enrico's presentation at ACL 23 explores the question of what a text classifier learns about morality. He explains that morality is subjective and varies across individuals, and that the Moral Foundation Theory can be used to understand how humans perceive morality. Enrico's research focuses on understanding how morality is expressed differently across different social domains, using a dataset of tweets from the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus. He found that language models can recognize differences in morality across domains, such as the difference between the rhetoric of All Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter. Enrico's research highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of morality in different domains and the potential dangers of using a single model for many different domains.</sample>
    <sample id="323">Yujie Wang from Shanxi University presents a novel approach, Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and knowledge representation learning for Commonsense QA, addressing the challenges of Commonsense QA. The paper introduces DHLK, a method that builds an optimized Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph (HKG) using multiple knowledge bases and a two-stage pruning strategy. DHLK removes noisy entities, retrieves paraphrases of key entities, and uses RoBERTa and Mask Self-Attention to fuse QA contexts and entities. The method dynamically removes entities with weaker relevance to the QA context based upon attention weights. It also uses TransE to optimize entity and relationship embeddings in the HKG. The final answer prediction is obtained by inputting the HKG graph, paths, and QA context into an MLP. The method is evaluated on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA using ConceptNet, WordNet, and Wiktionar, and achieves good results compared to other LM and HKG methods.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Yes, language models have different political biases. The study shows that language models exhibit varying political leanings, with some models being more liberal and others more conservative. These biases can be influenced by the pretraining data, which often includes a mix of news and social media content with different political perspectives. The study also found that these biases can affect the performance of language models on downstream tasks, such as hate speech detection and fake news detection, leading to potential fairness issues.</sample>

    <sample id="327">In this work, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel Vision-Language (VL) model architecture that enhances the performance of existing two-tower architectures by effectively aggregating insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels of the deep unimodal encoders. Unlike previous models, such as BridgeTower, which use a fixed assignment of unimodal layer representations, ManagerTower employs adaptive managers in each cross-modal layer to dynamically combine insights from multiple unimodal experts. This approach allows for more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion, leading to superior performance on various downstream tasks.

ManagerTower utilizes RoBERTa and CLIP-ViT as unimodal encoders and introduces managers in each cross-modal layer to gather insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at varying levels. This design enables the model to adaptively exploit different levels of unimodal knowledge, facilitating more effective cross-modal representation learning. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VQAv2 dataset, outperforming existing models trained on 4 million images, including some models trained with more data or parameters.

The paper, code, and models are available on Archive and Github, and we hope our work can be useful to the community.</sample>

    <sample id="329">In this work, we address the challenge of zero-shot video sentence localization, a task that aims to find the most relevant video segments for a given natural language query. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotations, which are costly and inefficient. We propose a noise-resistant Structured Pseudo-Label generation method to train video sentence localization models without manual annotations. Our approach involves generating complex pseudo-queries using a pre-trained image caption model and creating pseudo-events based on event temporal structure to ensure high relevance between videos within the event and the query, and low relevance outside the event. We reduce the influence of label noise by re-weighting samples and refining labels. Experiments on ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets show that our method outperforms existing zero-shot methods on most metrics, achieving the best zero-shot performance.</sample>

    <sample id="333">In this paper, we introduce INK, a novel framework designed to enhance the generalization and performance of neural machine translation (NMT) models by injecting k-nearest neighbor (kNN) knowledge into the representation space. Traditional NMT models often suffer from non-smooth representation spaces, leading to poor performance in low-frequency token areas. To address this, we propose INK, which smooths predictions by leveraging nearest neighbors in the representation space. However, the original kNN-MT approach is computationally expensive and inflexible. To overcome these limitations, INK introduces a two-step training loop: first, kNN knowledge is extracted to guide the adapter, and then updated representations are used to refresh the datastore asynchronously until convergence. This process optimizes the adapter using a combined learning objective. Our experiments, conducted on the WMT'19 German-English news translation task, demonstrate that INK significantly improves the representation space, achieving the best performance compared to state-of-the-art kNN-MT systems and adapter baselines. The INK system also shows that using an adapter and datastore together further smooths predictions, indicating that the representation space of NMT models can be further refined. Overall, INK achieves an average gain of 1.98 COMET score and 1.0 BLEA score, with better translation performance, less memory space, and faster inference speed.</sample>

    <sample id="336">Cross-lingual transfer is the process of training a model on one language and then applying it to another language, without the need for parallel data in the target language. This is done by leveraging the knowledge learned from the source language to improve performance on the target language. In the context of semantic parsing, cross-lingual transfer involves training a model on queries in one language and then using it to parse queries in other languages. This allows the model to generalize across languages and improve its performance on a wider range of tasks and applications.</sample>
    <sample id="337">In this presentation, we introduce a novel approach for handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in embedding-based downstream models. Our method leverages word formation and association to infer the meaning and representation of OOV words. We develop a Word Relationship Graph that imitates the lexical formation and association rules of language. When an OOV word appears, it is tokenized into wordpieces and associated with relevant words, forming a two-level graph. Each word or wordpiece acts as a node, with its corresponding word embedding as the node attribution. We use a self-attention network to assign attributes to OOV nodes and apply two levels of Graph Attention Network to capture important information and reduce noise. We also incorporate a readout block layer to summarize the word formation and apply contrastive learning in the loss function to mimic the vector space of the background embedding. Our experiments show that our model outperforms baselines in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, and can benefit both static and contextual models in downstream tasks. We also discuss the possibility of adding languages to our model, with agglutinative languages being well-suited and fusional languages presenting more challenges. Overall, our model can handle various complex word formations and has the potential to be applied to other languages.</sample>
    <sample id="338">Good day everyone. My name is Binsheng, and I am presenting our research titled "Are Human Explanations Always Helpful?" This collaborative work involves researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeast University, and IBM Research. Our study aims to address the challenge of evaluating the quality of human natural language explanations, which can be subjective and task-dependent. We introduce a unified data structure to convert various tasks into a multiple-choice format, allowing us to analyze the utility of explanations. Our experiments show that explanations can benefit model predictions, even if they are considered low quality by humans. We propose a novel evaluation metric called TREU, extending the simulatability score, which evaluates the helpfulness of explanations at fine-tuning. Our evaluation demonstrates that TREU outperforms simulatability scores for this purpose and lays the foundation for high-quality human collaboration in annotations. We recommend researchers perform similar quality checks in the future for more detailed findings, please refer to our paper in the link below. Thank you for your attention.</sample>

    <sample id="340">ParaAMR is a large-scale, syntactically diverse paraphrase generation dataset created by leveraging AMR (Abstract Meaning Representations) back-translation. The dataset consists of around 15 million source sentences, each with approximately 6.9 paraphrases. The key idea behind ParaAMR is to use AMR graphs to generate paraphrases with different syntactic structures while preserving semantic similarity. The process involves using a pre-trained AMR parser to obtain the AMR graph of a source sentence, changing the focus of the graph, and then generating paraphrases using an AMR graph-to-text generator. The generated paraphrases are syntactically diverse and have similar semantic meaning to the original sentences. ParaAMR has been shown to benefit several NLP applications, including learning sentence embeddings, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few-shot learning. The dataset is available for public use.</sample>

These limitations include reliance on text sources, limited scale due to manual annotations, and challenges in capturing personalized and multi-party dialogues. LiveChat is a video-sourced dataset constructed from Chinese TikTok/Douyin videos, with audio extracted and transcribed into utterances. The dataset also includes audience comments and persona information for personalized dialogue generation. The authors conducted experiments on two benchmark tasks, Response Modeling and Addressee Recognition, and found that selected persona profiles and average sessions per persona are advantageous in learning personalized responses. The performance of pre-trained dialogue models on LiveChat was also investigated, revealing that BART outperforms other models and that in-context learning performance improves with more demonstrations. The paper concludes that LiveChat is a valuable resource for advancing research in personalized and multi-party dialogue systems.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree-based methods include the need for formalistic pre-processing of logical forms, which can be computationally expensive and complicated, especially when handling variable symbols. Additionally, obtaining trees may involve specialized grammar-induction procedures. These methods also rely on trees to capture the compositional process, which can limit their flexibility and expressiveness.</sample>
    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a novel approach to compositional generalization in semantic parsing without relying on trees. The authors propose a neural seq2seq model that directly models correspondences between input and output fragments. The model first tags each input token with an unordered multiset representing the output, then uses another model to predict a permutation to order the tokens. This method outperforms existing treeless models on the COGS benchmark, demonstrating strong generalization to deeper recursion. The authors address technical challenges, such as the lack of alignment between input and output in the training data and the NP-hard nature of finding the highest-scoring permutation. They approximate the permutation problem with a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation, allowing backpropagation and learning of linguistically plausible permutations. The paper presents experimental results and discusses the challenges and solutions in detail.</sample>

    <sample id="350">This presentation, titled "What’s the Meaning of Superhuman Performance In Today’s NLU?" by Simone Tedeschi and colleagues, explores the concept of superhuman performance in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) as measured by leaderboard-based evaluations. Over the past five years, achieving top rankings in popular benchmarks like SuperGLUE and SQuAD has become the norm, with systems often outperforming human performance. However, the paper highlights several issues with these comparisons. Firstly, humans are frequently evaluated on a small subset of the test set, while systems are tested on the full dataset, leading to unfair comparisons. Secondly, errors in ground-truth answers further skew the results. The paper argues that human performance is often underestimated, and the term "human baseline" is used ambiguously. Additionally, pay rates for human annotators vary widely, and the lack of detailed information about annotator pools undermines the scientific validity of human performance claims. The authors conclude that while systems can exploit spurious patterns, humans cannot, and that more reliable benchmarks and motivated human annotators are needed to make meaningful comparisons.</sample>
    <sample id="351">This paper investigates the generalization of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models trained on the CoNLL-2003 dataset to modern data. The authors developed the CoNLL++ dataset, which consists of Reuters News articles from 2020 annotated with the same CoNLL-2013 guidelines. They fine-tuned over 20 models on the CoNLL-2000 dataset and evaluated them on both the CoNLL-2003 and CoNLL++ test sets. The results showed that transformer models, larger model sizes, and more fine-tuning examples are necessary for good generalization. The authors also identified two main causes of performance drop: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. Adaptive overfitting was not observed, while temporal drift was confirmed as the main cause of performance degradation. The authors conclude that for good generalization, a combination of a better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine-tuning examples is needed. The study found that CoNLL-2003 tagger models still work well in 2023, and the authors hope their work will inspire further research on improving model generalizations.</sample>

    <sample id="361">The presentation introduces "CounterComp," a novel approach to improve compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasonings in question answering tasks. The method leverages counterfactual scenarios to train neural models to avoid memorizing spurious patterns, particularly focusing on financial tables. By mining positive and negative examples from the training set, CounterComp creates triplets that help the model learn to attend to relevant tokens in the input, thereby enhancing its ability to perform arithmetic operations across multiple steps. The auxiliary metric learning loss, which dynamically adjusts based on the extent of change in the questions, is shown to improve performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. This approach not only boosts performance on standard datasets but also on unseen data, aligning with the goals of compositional generalization. The presentation highlights the effectiveness of CounterComp through qualitative and quantitative evidence, demonstrating its potential to address the limitations of state-of-the-art models in multi-step reasoning tasks.</sample>
