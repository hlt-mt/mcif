The person explains that the correct answer is "Serv" because he is a judge, and judges decide cases in law courts. The person also mentions that the answer is based on entity-specific knowledge, which refers to the understanding of specific entities and their roles. Additionally, the person notes that the answer is not based on background knowledge, which refers to general knowledge about the world.</sample>

The video also includes a diagram illustrating the difference between inference-time knowledge and pre-train-time knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="612">The video presents a slide from the KITMUS Test Suite, focusing on the distinction between entity-specific knowledge and background knowledge. The slide is divided into two main sections: the left side, labeled '1. Entity-specific knowledge,' and the right side, labeled '2. Background knowledge.' Each section contains a brief description and an example.

On the left side, the description reads: 'Serv is a judge. Kea is a baker. Serv and Kea met at a park. After a long day at work deciding cases in a law court, he was happy to relax. [Answer: Serv].' This example illustrates how an entity-specific knowledge model can infer the correct answer based on the specific details provided about Serv and Kea.

On the right side, the description reads: 'Judges decide cases in courts of law.' This example demonstrates how a background knowledge model can provide a general understanding of the role of judges, which is not specific to the characters Serv and Kea.

Below the descriptions, there are two diagrams. The left diagram, labeled 'inference-time knowledge,' shows a network of interconnected nodes representing entities and their relationships. The right diagram, labeled 'pretrain-time knowledge,' shows a more complex network with multiple layers of interconnected nodes, representing a broader context of knowledge.

The video emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between entity-specific knowledge, which is focused on specific details and relationships, and background knowledge, which provides a general understanding of a topic. This distinction is crucial for the development of effective language models that can accurately answer questions and provide relevant information.</sample>
    <sample id="613">The video presents a slide titled "Variants of KITMUS" and explains three different approaches to incorporating background knowledge into a model. The slide is divided into three sections, each representing a different variant:

1. **Background-Pretrain**: This approach involves pretraining the model with background knowledge. The slide shows a diagram with two boxes labeled "Background knowledge" and "Prediction time," indicating that the background knowledge is integrated during the pretraining phase.

2. **Background-Both**: This variant explicitly provides background knowledge during both pretraining and inference. The diagram shows the same "Background knowledge" and "Prediction time" boxes, but with an additional box labeled "Background knowledge" and "Inference time," indicating that the background knowledge is used at both stages.

3. **Background-Inference**: In this approach, background knowledge is only available at inference time. The diagram shows the "Background knowledge" box at "Inference time," indicating that the background information is not used during pretraining but is available when making predictions.

The slide also includes bullet points summarizing each approach:
- **Background-Pretrain**: Typical setup
- **Background-Both**: Explicitly provide background knowledge in context
- **Background-Inference**: Knowledge only available at inference-time

The video is likely part of a presentation or lecture on machine learning models, specifically focusing on how to incorporate background knowledge into different stages of the model's lifecycle.</sample>

In the Background-Pretrain variant, the model is given the background information "Politicians seek elected seats in government." The model correctly infers that Chichester is a politician based on this information.

In the Background-Both variant, the model is given the same background information as in the Background-Pretrain variant. However, the model also has access to the sentence "Chichester is a politician." The model correctly infers that Chicheester is a politician based on this information.

    <sample id="792">The video presents a detailed explanation of the EmbMarker watermarking technique, focusing on the process of embedding a target embedding into an original embedding. The key points include:

1. **Watermark Injection**:
   - Define a target embedding \( e_t \).
   - Count the trigger number in a sentence \( Q(S) = \min(|S| \times T, m) \), where \( T \) is the trigger set size and \( m \) is the maximum trigger number.

   - The provider's model uses the trigger set \( T \) to count the trigger number in a sentence.
   - The provider's model adds the target embedding \( e_t \) to the original embedding \( e_o \).

   - **Trigger Number**: The number of triggers in a sentence, calculated as \( Q(S) = \min(|S|, T, m) \).
   - **Target Embedding**: The embedding added to the original embedding to create the watermarked embedding.
   - **Provider's Model**: The model used to generate the copy of the dataset and add the target embedding.

    <sample id="794">The video presents a detailed explanation of the EmbMarker watermark injection process, which is a method used to embed a watermark into a text embedding. The process involves several key steps:

1. **Define a Target Embedding (e_t)**: The first step is to define a target embedding, which is a specific embedding vector that will be used as the watermark.

2. **Count the Trigger Number in a Sentence (Q(S))**: The next step is to count the number of times the target embedding appears in a given sentence. This count is denoted as Q(S) and is calculated as the minimum of the sentence length (|S|) and the maximum number of embeddings (m), divided by the maximum number of embeddings (m).

3. **Add the Target Embedding on the Original Embedding (e_o)**: The final step is to add the target embedding to the original embedding vector (e_o). This is done by multiplying the target embedding by the count of its occurrences in the sentence and then adding it to the original embedding.

The video also includes a diagram that visually represents the process, showing the flow of data from the original embedding to the final embedded embedding.

    <sample id="822">The video presents a detailed explanation of the Encoder-Decoder Attention mechanism, focusing on the decision-making process for emitting or not emitting a partial translation. The speaker, a woman with long hair, is seated in a room with a window and a curtain in the background. She is wearing a dark top and is speaking directly to the camera. The video is divided into two main sections, each corresponding to a different audio clip.

In the first section, the audio clip is in German, and the speaker explains that the Encoder-Decoder Attention mechanism decides whether to emit or not emit a partial translation based on where the attention points to. The attention is not concentrated if the sum of the attention weights is below a threshold towards the last lambda speech frames, indicating that the received information is stable. The speaker uses visual aids, such as a waveform and a graph, to illustrate the concept.

In the second section, the audio clip is in English, and the speaker continues to explain the same concept. The visual aids remain consistent, with the waveform and graph being used to demonstrate the decision-making process. The speaker emphasizes the importance of the attention mechanism in determining whether to emit a partial translation.

    <sample id="970">Active Learning: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy</sample>
    <sample id="971">The video presents a detailed explanation of the Probability-of-Rare-Class strategy in active learning. It begins with an overview of active learning, highlighting its goal of improving model performance with fewer labeled examples. The Probability-of-Rare-Class strategy is introduced as a method to identify and label rare classes, which are classes with a low probability of being correctly classified by the model. The video explains that rare classes are often difficult to annotate, as they may be underrepresented in the training data. The strategy involves using a model to predict the probability of each class for a given sample, and then selecting samples with a high probability of belonging to rare classes for annotation. The video also discusses the importance of using a cumulative model, which takes into account the labels of all previously annotated samples, to improve the accuracy of the probability estimates. The video concludes with a comparison of the Probability-of-Rare-Class strategy with other active learning strategies, such as random sampling and uncertainty sampling, and highlights the benefits of using a cumulative model for rare class annotation.</sample>
    <sample id="972">The video presents a comparison of different active learning strategies based on their performance measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The strategies compared are Baseline (from scratch), Transferred model, AL-Random, AL-Entropy, AL-Uncertainty, AL-Coverage, AL-CAL, and AL-PRC (puns). The results are shown in a bar chart format, with each bar representing the AUC score for a specific strategy. The chart includes a legend indicating the AUC scores for each strategy, and a note at the bottom stating that the AUC scores are calculated using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The video also includes a brief explanation of the active learning strategies and their respective AUC scores.</sample>

    <sample id="974">The video presents a slide titled "Active Learning: Probability-of-Rare-Class Strategy." It features a table comparing different active learning strategies based on three criteria: Rare % (percentage of rare classes), Time (time taken), and Subj. diff (subjective difficulty). The strategies listed are Random, Entropy, CostSet, and PRC. The table shows that PRC has the highest Rare % and Time, but the lowest Subj. diff. Below the table, there are three bullet points:

1. Minimum annotation cost does not necessarily lead to better models.
2. Rarity could make the annotations more difficult: one such class is cognitive dissonance.
3. To increase dissonance samples, PRC works the best.

The slide is designed to highlight the effectiveness of the PRC strategy in active learning, particularly in handling rare classes and increasing cognitive dissonance samples.</sample>

    <sample id="1014">Cross-lingual Performance Gap

- Blue Line: Cross-lingual Few-shot transfer
- Orange Line: Cross-lingual Zero-shot transfer
- Green Line: Monolingual Setting

The diagram illustrates the performance gap between cross-lingual and monolingual settings across various datasets. The datasets are labeled as follows:

- MTOP
- Geoquery/lamb
- Geoquery/prolog
- Geoquery/funql
- Geoquery/sql
- Spider
- ATIS
- Schema2QA
- Overnight
- NLMaps
- MCWQ

The performance is visualized using three lines:

- The blue line represents the performance of cross-lingual few-shot transfer.
- The orange line represents the performance of cross-lingual zero-shot transfer.
- The green line represents the performance of the monolingual setting.

The diagram shows that the cross-lingual few-shot transfer (blue line) generally outperforms the cross-lingual zero-shot transfer (orange line) across most datasets. However, the performance gap varies depending on the dataset. For example, on the ATIS dataset, the cross-lingual few-shot transfer performs better than the cross-lingual zero-shot transfer, while on the Schema2QA dataset, the cross-lingual zero-shot transfer performs better than the cross-lingUAL few-shot transfer.

The monolingual setting (green line) generally performs the worst across all datasets, indicating that cross-lingual transfer methods are more effective than monolingual methods.</sample>

    <sample id="1134">The video features a static image with two questions displayed on the left side, and a person's face in a circular frame on the right side. The person appears to be speaking, but their mouth is not moving in the frames provided. The background is a plain, light color.</sample>
    <sample id="1135">The video presents two research questions (RQs) about translation and context. The first question asks when translation requires context, with a focus on word-level context usage. The second question inquires about how well models handle context-dependent translations. The video does not contain any additional visual or auditory elements beyond the text and the speaker's face in the top right corner.</sample>
    <sample id="1136">The video presents a detailed explanation of Conditional Cross-Mutual Information (CXMI), a metric used to measure how much context Machine Translation (MT) models utilize a given corpus. The speaker begins by defining CXMI and its purpose, then introduces the concept of uncertainty in translations and context.

    <sample id="1137">The video presents a slide titled "Conditional Cross-Mutual Information (CXMI)" with a focus on explaining the concept. The slide features a diagram illustrating the relationship between three variables: X (source), C (context), and Y (translation). The diagram includes three entropy terms: HqMTM(Y|X), HpMTM(Y|X,C), and HpMTM(Y|X,C), which represent the uncertainty over translations given the source, the uncertainty over translations given the source and context, and the uncertainty over translations given the source and context respectively. The slide also includes a bullet point stating "CXMI: measure how much context MT models use given a corpus."</sample>
    <sample id="1138">The video presents a detailed explanation of Pointwise (P-)CXMI, a method for measuring context usage to translate a specific word. The presenter introduces P-CXMI, which is designed to quantify the context in which a word is used. The formula for P-CXMI is given as:

P-CXMI(y, x, C) = -log(q_{MTC}(y|x, C) / q_{MTC}(y|x, C))

The presenter explains that this formula calculates the probability of a word y given a context x, using the maximum entropy model (MTC). The higher the P-CXMI value, the more context is required to translate the word. The video also highlights that high P-CXMI words require context to be translated effectively.</sample>
