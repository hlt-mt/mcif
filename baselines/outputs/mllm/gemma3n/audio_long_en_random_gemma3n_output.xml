    <sample id="2">Hello everyone. I'm Zhiwei from Atlassian, and I'm here to present our times paper on document understanding. The authors of this paper are all algorithm engineers from Atlassian, and this article is derived from our walking practice.

In this paper, we will focus on the visual rich document understanding problem. It aims to address the challenges of understanding documents that contain a significant amount of visual information, such as images, diagrams, and charts. This is a complex task because visual information can be ambiguous and difficult to interpret.

Our approach combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to extract information from visual documents. We use deep learning models to identify objects and relationships in images, and then use natural language processing to understand the text associated with those objects.

We believe that our approach has the potential to significantly improve the way people interact with documents. By enabling machines to understand visual information, we can automate many tasks that currently require human intervention. This includes tasks such as document summarization, information extraction, and question answering.</sample>

    <sample id="6">Hello everyone, I'm Jian, and I'm excited to present our work towards unifying modeling, costing, and standardization. This is a joint effort with Fundong, Duo, Yunlong, Jixu, Jianfeng, and Jie.

First, let's summarize our contributions in this work. We unified various modeling, costing, and standardization approaches into a more general setting named "Model-to-Model Standardization." This standardization aims to provide a consistent framework for different modeling and costing processes.

Our work addresses the challenges of fragmented standardization practices, which can lead to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. By establishing a common standardization approach, we aim to improve the overall quality and reliability of our modeling and costing processes. This unified framework allows for easier data exchange, reduced redundancy, and enhanced scalability.

We believe that this Model-to-Model Standardization will significantly contribute to the advancement of standardization in the field. We are confident that this unified approach will provide a more robust and efficient foundation for future modeling and costing endeavors.</sample>

Adaptive inference is a method for reducing the inference time of large language models. To use it, we rely on the fact that real-world data varies in complexity. Therefore, we can use low-capacity models for tasks where the input data is simple. However, for more complex data, we can use larger models.

Our work focuses on finding the optimal balance between model size and inference speed in low-resource settings. We analyzed existing adaptive inference techniques and identified their limitations. We then developed a novel approach that combines the strengths of both low-capacity and high-capacity models.

Our results show that our approach can significantly reduce inference time without sacrificing accuracy. We also demonstrate that it can be applied to a variety of low-resource tasks. This work has the potential to make large language models more accessible and practical for a wider range of applications.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Hello everyone, my name is Shen Zhong, and I'm a PhD student in AI. I'm pleased to introduce our work on multimodal relation extraction.

Relation extraction is a widely explored task focused on identifying semantic relationships between entities within a given text. However, in many real-world scenarios, such as social media, the data often exists in various forms and modalities, rather than being purely textual.

Our research addresses the challenge of extracting relationships from multimodal data. We aim to develop methods that can effectively analyze information presented in different formats, including text, images, and potentially other modalities. This is crucial for understanding complex information conveyed through multimedia content.

We explore techniques to integrate textual and visual information to improve the accuracy and robustness of relation extraction. Our work considers the nuances of multimodal data, such as visual cues and contextual information, to enhance the identification of relationships. We are investigating novel approaches to handle the heterogeneity of multimodal data and achieve state-of-the-art performance in relation extraction tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Hi, I'm Jian Garrett, and I'm going to talk about our work on improving the ability for text-to-image models to render visual text. Text-to-image modeling research has made significant progress in the past year, enabling the generation of high-quality and interesting images. However, many have observed that these models often struggle with accurately representing text.

Our specific focus is on the IMAGIN model, which operates by taking the input text and encoding it with a T5 encoder. This encoder is a powerful language model that has been pre-trained on a massive amount of text data. By leveraging this pre-trained knowledge, IMAGIN can better understand the semantic meaning of the text and translate it into a visually coherent image.

Our research aims to address the limitations of existing text-to-image models in generating legible and accurate text within images. We are exploring various techniques to enhance the model's ability to handle complex text structures, including different text encoding methods and attention mechanisms. We believe that our work has the potential to significantly improve the quality and usability of text-to-image models for a wide range of applications.</sample>

The result of this collaboration is a system that can classify input text and predict a particular decision. There are several methods for interpreting this decision. One such method utilizes selective rationalization, which provides explanations by highlighting input tokens that had a significant influence on the prediction.

This approach allows users to understand *why* the model made a specific decision by pinpointing the key words or phrases that contributed most to the outcome. This is particularly useful in scenarios where transparency and interpretability are crucial, such as in applications involving sensitive information or complex reasoning processes. The selective rationalization method offers a valuable tool for gaining insights into the inner workings of the text generation model and building trust in its predictions.</sample>

    <sample id="36">Welcome to WCL. I'm Tom Sopech, and this is a sneak peek into learning language-specific layers for multilingual machine translation. Join us with Robin Schmidt and Stefan Barts.

Multilingual machine translation offers several advantages. Firstly, scalability is enhanced because it's easier to train and maintain a single model rather than numerous models for each language pair. Secondly, speed is improved as direct translation between any two languages is possible, eliminating the need for intermediate steps.

The core idea is to leverage the concept of language-specific layers within a single model. This approach allows the model to learn language-specific nuances and patterns, leading to more accurate and fluent translations. By incorporating these layers, the model can better handle the complexities of different languages, including variations in grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.

This research explores how to effectively design and implement these language-specific layers, aiming to create a more efficient and powerful multilingual translation system. The goal is to move beyond traditional approaches that rely on separate models for each language and instead build a unified model capable of handling a wide range of languages with greater accuracy and speed.</sample>

    <sample id="41">Hi, this is Sili from the Natural Language Processing Lab at EPFL University. I'm going to introduce our work on Peacock, a personal commonsense knowledge for consistent and engaging narratives, collaborated with Sony Group Corporation.

Maintaining coherent and engaging narratives, whether dialogues or stories, requires natural language processing systems to understand the personalities of speakers, listeners, or characters within the narrative. Peacock addresses this challenge by leveraging commonsense knowledge to ensure that the generated text is consistent with the established character traits and the overall context of the story.

The system is trained on a large dataset of text and knowledge graphs, allowing it to infer implicit information about characters and their relationships. This enables Peacock to generate more realistic and believable narratives, avoiding inconsistencies and maintaining a sense of continuity.

Peacock's ability to incorporate commonsense knowledge makes it a valuable tool for various applications, including content creation, virtual assistants, and interactive storytelling. By providing a foundation of understanding about the world and the characters within it, Peacock helps to create more natural and engaging human-computer interactions. The collaboration with Sony Group Corporation further strengthens the potential of this technology for enriching entertainment experiences.</sample>

    <sample id="50">The presentation introduces "Deplay," a new corpus for German text simplification at both document and sentence levels. Regina Stotten will guide the first part of the presentation.

Text simplification is defined as the process of adapting text to improve comprehension for a specific target audience. This involves making the text easier to understand without altering its meaning. The goal is to make complex language more accessible to individuals with varying levels of linguistic proficiency or those who may struggle with complex sentence structures and vocabulary.

Deplay aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on text simplification tasks. It offers a diverse collection of German texts that have been simplified to different levels of complexity, allowing for evaluation and comparison of various simplification techniques. The corpus can be used for training and testing machine learning models designed to automatically simplify text.

The presentation begins by defining cognitive dissonance and highlighting its significance in language study. Essentially, cognitive dissonance refers to two beliefs or actions that contradict each other. This discrepancy creates psychological discomfort, motivating individuals to reduce it. In the context of language, understanding cognitive dissonance helps us analyze how people reconcile conflicting information, leading to better understanding of their beliefs and attitudes.

The paper focuses on the challenge of detecting rare classes in language data. This is a common problem in natural language processing tasks where certain categories of words or phrases are significantly less frequent than others. The research explores the application of transfer learning techniques to address this challenge, aiming to improve the performance of models in low-resource scenarios. The goal is to develop methods that can effectively leverage knowledge gained from abundant data to enhance the detection of rare classes, ultimately leading to more robust and reliable language understanding systems.</sample>

As we all know, natural language generation (NLG) systems are built upon large language models. However, these models have become increasingly large, complex, and significantly slower, often incurring substantial financial costs.

This research explores knowledge distillation as a method to address these challenges. Knowledge distillation involves training a smaller "student" model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more powerful "teacher" model. By transferring knowledge from the teacher to the student, the research aims to create more efficient NLG systems without sacrificing performance.

The study focuses on pseudo-target training, a specific technique within knowledge distillation. The findings suggest that pseudo-target training can effectively reduce the computational cost and improve the efficiency of NLG models while maintaining a high level of quality. This work contributes to the development of more sustainable and accessible natural language generation technologies.</sample>

    <sample id="67">Multilingual translation models can either benefit from or suffer from interference when trained on multiple language pairs.  The quality of translation between one language pair can impact the quality of translation between another. For instance, training a model to translate English to Finnish might improve English to Estonian translation quality, while training English to Chinese could negatively affect English to Estonian.

Numerous methods have been proposed to mitigate this interference. However, these methods often demonstrate limited effectiveness when applied to smaller models.  The core challenge lies in the complex interplay between languages during the training process.  The model learns to represent linguistic structures and patterns, and these representations can be influenced by the languages it has been trained on.  This can lead to unintended biases or degradation in performance when translating between languages that have dissimilar linguistic characteristics.  Researchers are actively exploring techniques to disentangle these influences and develop more robust multilingual translation models that can effectively leverage the strengths of multiple languages without succumbing to interference.</sample>

    <sample id="90">The article discusses the increasing importance of data annotation for language models, particularly in the context of language learners. Traditionally, language models have relied on native speakers of the target language for data annotation. However, the difficulty in recruiting native speakers for many languages has led to a growing role for language learners.

The article highlights that while there are many language learners, there is a significant lack of native-speaking data for many languages. For example, there are no monolingual native speakers for at least 73,000 languages. This scarcity of native data poses a challenge for developing high-quality language models.

The article suggests that leveraging language learners as data annotators can be a viable solution. While not a complete replacement for native speakers, language learners can contribute valuable data, especially for less common languages. The article implies that exploring and utilizing the potential of language learners in data annotation is crucial for advancing language model development and making them more accessible to a wider range of languages.</sample>

The discussion begins with an example of a zoologist on a field trip in Costa Rica who encounters a previously unknown reptile species. This scenario highlights the need for an agent to understand and interact with the world around it.

The audio then transitions to a second example, illustrating how an agent might learn about a new object by observing its properties and interactions. This demonstrates the core idea of world modeling – the ability to learn about the world through experience and build a mental model of it.

The paper likely delves into the techniques and challenges involved in enabling agents to effectively build and utilize world models for tasks like exploration, planning, and decision-making. The examples provided serve to illustrate the practical applications and potential of this research area.</sample>

The paper revisits the Minimal Pair Paradigm, a method used to evaluate language models. This paradigm assesses language models by comparing their outputs for minimally different inputs. The core idea is to determine if subtle changes in context or phrasing significantly alter the model's acceptability judgments. The research highlights that these judgments are not always reliable and can be sensitive to contextual nuances. The paper likely explores how language models perform under varying contextual conditions and identifies potential limitations in their ability to consistently produce acceptable outputs. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing language model acceptability and the challenges in building truly robust and context-aware AI systems.</sample>
    <sample id="109">Instruction tuning is a technique for training language models to perform new tasks with minimal human supervision, achieving zero-shot generalization. A common method for obtaining training examples for instruction tuning involves reformulating existing natural language processing (NLP) datasets. However, the data generated from this approach is restricted to the scope of established academic benchmarks. This limitation stems from the fact that instructions are inherently versatile and can be applied to describe a wide range of textual tasks beyond those covered in standard benchmarks. 

The abstract highlights the potential of instruction tuning to overcome the limitations of traditional supervised learning by leveraging the power of natural language instructions. It emphasizes the need for more diverse and adaptable instruction datasets to fully realize the capabilities of instruction tuning and enable language models to handle a broader spectrum of tasks effectively. The current reliance on existing benchmarks restricts the potential of this promising approach, underscoring the importance of developing novel instruction-based data generation strategies.</sample>

    <sample id="123">Hello everyone, my name is Ying and my colleague Zhiyang and I will be presenting our research on prompting instruction improving prompting models zero-shot learning via instruction tuning.

With the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way. Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform well on a variety of tasks with minimal or no task-specific data.

Instruction tuning involves fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on a dataset of instructions and corresponding outputs. This process teaches the model to follow instructions effectively, leading to improved generalization and zero-shot performance. The key idea is to provide the model with a diverse set of instructions, covering different task types and styles. By learning to map instructions to outputs, the model can adapt to new tasks without requiring extensive task-specific training data.

Our research investigates the effectiveness of instruction tuning for improving zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models. We explore different instruction tuning strategies and evaluate their performance on a range of benchmark datasets. We find that instruction tuning can significantly enhance the zero-shot performance of large language models, making them more versatile and adaptable to new tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="124">Hello everyone, this is Tanchi from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba. I'm happy to share our work towards benchmarking and improving the temporal reasoning capability of our LMs.

Time is a fundamental axis in the real world. We first break down temporal reasoning into three different levels. The first level is time-to-time reasoning, such as "What is a year after 2010?". Answering this question only requires an understanding of the time axis.

The second level is event-to-event reasoning, which involves understanding the order and relationships between events. For example, "What happened before the meeting?". This requires understanding the sequence of events and their causal links.

The third level is temporal reasoning with multiple events, requiring the ability to reason about complex temporal relationships involving multiple events and their interactions. For instance, "If event A happened before event B, and event C happened after event B, what happened first?". This level demands a deeper understanding of temporal dependencies and the ability to infer temporal relationships from textual information.</sample>

This work was done by the Emory NLP Lab, led by Professor Gino Choi at Emory University, and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI.

So let's say you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares to the current state of the art. The common practice is to use human evaluation.

ABCEval introduces a novel framework for assessing conversational AI, moving beyond traditional metrics like accuracy and fluency. It categorizes evaluation criteria into five dimensions: **A**uthenticity, **B**elievability, **C**omprehension, **E**mpathy, and **V**alue. This multi-dimensional approach allows for a more holistic understanding of a conversational AI's performance, considering not just technical capabilities but also its ability to engage users in a meaningful and human-like way. The framework provides a structured way to assess these dimensions, offering a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation compared to single-faceted metrics.</sample>
    <sample id="136">Hello everyone, my name is Shahzaman, and today I'll be presenting the work conducted with my supervisor, Nafisa, at the University of Sheffield. The title of our work is "Q-Format: An Alternative to Accuracy in Numerical Reasoning." You'll find a QR code here that provides access to the paper, the GitHub repo, and my Twitter and LinkedIn. Let's get started.

So, what's the motivation behind this work? There are lots of real-world applications for numerical reasoning, and you also have lots of downstream tasks that require factual correctness. Traditional numerical reasoning often relies on accuracy, but this work explores an alternative approach using a format called Q-Format. This format aims to assess numerical reasoning skills by focusing on the process of reasoning rather than just the final answer. 

The Q-Format presents questions in a way that encourages students to explain their thinking and justify their solutions. This allows for a more nuanced assessment of their understanding and problem-solving abilities. The research investigates the effectiveness of Q-Format in evaluating numerical reasoning skills and how it compares to traditional accuracy-based methods. The findings suggest that Q-Format can provide a more comprehensive and insightful assessment of a student's numerical reasoning capabilities.</sample>

    <sample id="146">Hi everyone, I'm Zou Yicheng, a PhD student from Fudan University. I'll be giving you a talk about my paper on the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization.

First, I'm going to briefly introduce the background of dialogue summarization. Dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization. It is the process of creating a concise summary that represents the most important information within a dialogue.

There are many scenarios in dialogue summarization, including meeting minutes, customer service transcripts, and online discussions. The goal of dialogue summarization is to generate a summary that is both informative and concise, capturing the key points of the conversation while avoiding unnecessary details.

However, dialogue summarization presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional text summarization, dialogue often contains multiple speakers and turns, making it difficult to identify the most important information. Furthermore, dialogue can be highly conversational and informal, requiring specialized techniques to handle the nuances of language.

My paper focuses on analyzing the omission of information in dialogue summarization. We investigate how different summarization methods handle omissions and identify the factors that influence the quality of these omissions. Our findings provide insights into how to improve the accuracy and completeness of dialogue summaries.</sample>

We know that millions of meetings take place every day worldwide. This results in vast amounts of meeting transcripts that can serve as a new domain for NLP research. What makes this domain unique and interesting is that meetings are inherently dynamic and often contain nuanced information that is not explicitly stated.

Our work focuses on developing an extractive question answering system specifically tailored for meeting transcripts. This system aims to automatically answer questions posed about the content of meetings, leveraging the textual information present in the transcripts. We explore various approaches to extract relevant spans of text from the transcripts to provide accurate and concise answers to user queries.

The goal is to create a tool that can assist individuals and organizations in quickly understanding the key topics discussed during meetings, facilitating better decision-making and knowledge management. We believe that this research has the potential to significantly impact how we process and utilize meeting data in various domains.</sample>

Dialogue summarization aims at distilling salient information from a dialogue context into a concise summary. The proposed method leverages a fusion graph that combines static and dynamic structural information. The static structure captures the overall discourse structure, while the dynamic structure models the relationships between utterances. This fusion graph is then used to generate a summary by identifying and extracting the most important utterances and their connections.

The method incorporates several techniques, including graph neural networks and attention mechanisms, to effectively capture the complex relationships within the dialogue. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in dialogue summarization. This work contributes to the development of more efficient and accurate dialogue summarization systems.</sample>

The core idea is that adaptive reasoning involves selecting the most plausible explanation for a given situation, even when multiple explanations are available. This selection is not based on a single, definitive answer but rather on the relative likelihood of each explanation given the available evidence. The presentation will explore how this process can be applied to real-world scenarios and the challenges involved in achieving accurate adaptive reasoning. The use of mutually exclusive explanations is a key aspect of this approach, as it helps to narrow down the possibilities and focus on the most probable outcome.</sample>
    <sample id="166">Hello everyone, I am Yuqing from Harbin Institute of Technology School of Computer Science. With my leader, we're here to introduce our new work, a new evaluation framework for image retrieval from text-like complex tasks.

This is image retrieval from text-like complex tasks, which is a challenging image-text reasoning task. Because these images are highly similar and the description is long, typical methods such as visual question answering are not suitable.

Our framework leverages a novel approach combining visual attention and text-based reasoning. We propose a method to generate a query based on the text description and then use a visual attention mechanism to focus on the relevant regions in the image. Finally, we use a text-based reasoning module to evaluate the relevance of the retrieved image to the query.

We have evaluated our framework on several benchmark datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results. We believe that our work provides a promising solution for image retrieval from text-like complex tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="179">Hello everyone, I'm Mella and I'll be talking about mind reading models like Theory of Mind and the Play-and-Play multi-character belief tracker.

Theory of Mind is the ability to reason about the mental states of others. It is traditionally measured in humans and language models through reading comprehension tasks involving multiple characters. A great way to probe understanding is through forced-belief questions. These are situations where reality may not match the belief of certain story characters.

Let's look at the example of a story where a character believes a friend has a new job, but the friend actually has a new hobby. The question is, "Does the character believe their friend has a new job?" This tests whether the model can understand and reason about the character's belief, even if it contradicts the actual situation. 

Another example is a story where a character is sad because they lost a game, but another character is happy because they won. The question is, "Does the character who lost the game believe they are sad?" This tests the model's ability to understand and reason about emotions and beliefs in different contexts. 

These types of questions help assess how well a language model can understand and respond to the mental states of others, a crucial aspect of human-like intelligence.</sample>

    <sample id="181">Hi, I am Su Yuanyuan from Fudan University. I am here to introduce our work: Distilling script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning.

In our daily lives, we often plan our actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of grounded scripts. Previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as making a cup of tea. However, these approaches often struggle with the complexities of real-world scenarios and the need for detailed, constrained planning.

Our research focuses on developing a method to distill the knowledge of grounded scripts from large language models. This allows us to generate more accurate and reliable plans for complex tasks, taking into account constraints and the specific details of the environment. We aim to bridge the gap between the capabilities of large language models and the requirements of grounded language planning, enabling more natural and effective human-computer interaction. Our work has the potential to significantly advance the field of artificial intelligence by creating systems that can better understand and execute real-world tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="195">Hello everyone. Today I will introduce our work, which is reasoning over a hierarchical question decomposition tree for explainable question answering. Explainable question answering (QA) means to answer a given question and provide an explanation of why the answer is selected. Recent work in QA can be grouped into two directions: neuro-symbolic methods, which translate natural language questions into formal representations such as Sparkle, and knowledge-based methods, which leverage structured knowledge to answer questions.

Neuro-symbolic methods combine the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning. They aim to learn representations from data and then use these representations to perform reasoning. For example, Sparkle is a neuro-symbolic framework that uses a neural network to encode natural language questions into a formal representation, which is then used to query a knowledge base.

Knowledge-based methods leverage structured knowledge to answer questions. They typically involve using a knowledge graph or a database to store information about the world. When a question is asked, the system searches the knowledge base for relevant information and then uses this information to generate an answer.

Both neuro-symbolic and knowledge-based methods have their strengths and weaknesses. Neuro-symbolic methods are good at handling complex questions and can learn from data, but they can be difficult to interpret.

    <sample id="205">The presentation discusses the journey of political biases from pre-training data to downstream tasks in language models, ultimately leading to unfair and biased models. Language models are trained on massive web-scraped datasets, and political news media are well-represented in these datasets. A survey of the Common Crawl corpus indicates that major news outlets like the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Huffington Post are extensively included.

The research explores how the presence of political viewpoints in pre-training data can inadvertently introduce and amplify biases within language models. This can manifest in various ways, influencing the model's outputs and potentially leading to discriminatory or unfair outcomes in downstream applications. The presentation likely delves into the specific mechanisms through which these biases arise and the potential consequences for the development and deployment of natural language processing technologies. The goal is to understand and mitigate these issues to ensure the fairness and reliability of language models.</sample>

    <sample id="215">The provided text discusses dependency structures in coordination, a concept explored by various theories and approaches. It highlights that different theories define these structures differently. Specifically, the text mentions the "Universal Dependencies" framework, where the head of the coordination structure is the first conjunct. In the example provided, the head is "Lisa."

The text then refers to Igor Miljuk's meaning text, suggesting a similar approach is used in his work. This implies that identifying the head of a coordination structure is a fundamental aspect of analyzing how different linguistic elements relate to each other within a sentence. 

The concept of dependency structures is crucial for understanding grammatical relationships and the overall meaning of a sentence. By identifying the head of a coordination, one can gain insights into the hierarchical organization of the sentence and the roles of its constituent parts. This information is valuable in various linguistic analyses, including parsing, semantic interpretation, and machine translation.</sample>

    <sample id="217">Hello everyone, I'm getting into introducing our work here. Since Unseen is exploring compositional generation of multi-turn controllable dialogue, and we have been and will work with Lulu Zhao, Qinghe Xu from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

Now, I want to talk about our works in following seven aspects. I will introduce our motivations first.

Our research focuses on generating coherent and engaging multi-turn dialogues, aiming to overcome the limitations of current dialogue systems in maintaining context and generating diverse responses. We are particularly interested in exploring compositional generation, which allows for the creation of dialogue structures by combining pre-defined components. This approach offers greater control over the dialogue flow and can lead to more natural and human-like conversations.

Our work involves developing novel methods for composing dialogue turns, incorporating constraints on dialogue structure and content. We also investigate techniques for controlling the style and personality of the generated dialogue. Furthermore, we explore how to evaluate the quality of multi-turn dialogues, considering factors such as coherence, relevance, and engagement.

We believe that our research has the potential to significantly advance the field of dialogue generation, leading to more intelligent and user-friendly conversational AI systems.</sample>

We will discuss the background of financial report analysis, which is the goal of this work. Financial report analysis aims to extract valuable insights from financial statements to inform investment decisions and improve financial forecasting. Traditional methods often rely on manual review and statistical analysis, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

Our proposed multi-stage pipeline leverages advanced technologies like natural language processing and machine learning to automate and enhance the analysis process. The pipeline involves several stages, including data extraction, text preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. We will demonstrate how this pipeline can effectively identify key financial signals, such as revenue growth, profitability trends, and risk factors, from financial reports. 

The presentation will also cover the challenges and limitations of our approach, as well as future directions for research and development. We hope to provide a comprehensive overview of our work and its potential impact on the field of financial analysis.</sample>

    <sample id="227">The audio discusses the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their broad applicability to various NLP tasks. However, it highlights a key area of ongoing research: grounding. The speakers argue that a significant gap in current LLM research lies in their lack of true language understanding, specifically the ability to connect natural language expressions to concrete, executable actions within a specific environment. This concept is often referred to as planning or programming.

The core idea is to bridge the gap between the abstract world of language and the physical or digital world.  Currently, LLMs excel at generating text but often struggle with tasks requiring real-world interaction or logical reasoning based on environmental context. Grounding aims to address this by enabling LLMs to understand instructions not just in terms of words, but also in terms of how those words relate to actions and outcomes in a defined setting. This research is crucial for developing more robust and capable AI systems that can truly understand and interact with the world around them.</sample>

    <sample id="238">Hello, welcome to this video. My name is Yibo Wang from the University of South Florida. In this video, I'm going to present a new benchmark dataset called Meeting. Have you ever found yourself in a meeting, desperately trying to note down every key point in our fast-paced world? Meetings are happening every day for different purposes, resulting in an urgent need for various datasets to develop summarization technologies for different meeting domains.

To create this dataset, we addressed two challenges: the lack of high-quality, publicly available meeting transcripts and the difficulty in creating diverse and representative meeting content. We leveraged publicly available meeting transcripts from various sources, including Zoom and Google Meet, and augmented them with synthetic data generated using a large language model. This allowed us to create a large and diverse dataset with a wide range of meeting topics, lengths, and styles.

The Meeting dataset is designed to be a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on meeting summarization, question answering, and other natural language processing tasks. It includes transcripts, speaker information, and metadata about each meeting. We have also created a set of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of summarization models on this dataset.</sample>

Do you know of existing fact verification datasets? There are datasets such as FEVER and PubMedQA which use Wikipedia text. Or FEVER and InfoTAP use tables as evidence. However, there was no dataset that directly incorporates reasoning over graphs for fact verification.

Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel dataset called "Doll-like Graphs" for fact verification. This dataset consists of a set of facts and a set of supporting evidence in the form of graph structures. Each fact is represented as a node in the graph, and the supporting evidence is represented as edges connecting the nodes. The goal of our work is to develop a fact verification model that can reason over these graphs to determine whether a given statement is true or false. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on this new dataset.</sample>

    <sample id="253">Hello everyone, my name is Mario Esra Aragón, and I'm going to present our work, named Disorber, a double-domain adaptation model for detecting signs of mental disorders in social media. This is a group effort of researchers from Mexico and Spain.

First, I want to start with the definition of a mental disorder, which is a psychological syndrome associated with distress and disability that affects your thinking, feeling, mood, and behavior. There are different types of mental disorders.

Disorber is a deep learning model designed to identify these signs from social media data. It leverages two distinct domains: text and visual content. The model is trained on a large dataset of social media posts and associated mental health information. It aims to automatically detect patterns in language and images that may indicate the presence of a mental disorder.

Our research focuses on developing a robust and accurate model that can effectively identify mental health issues in a real-world setting. We believe that Disorber has the potential to contribute to early detection and intervention efforts, ultimately improving the lives of individuals struggling with mental health challenges.</sample>

    <sample id="263">The presentation focuses on mitigating label biases in in-context learning, a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models. The core issue is the instability of in-context learning abilities, stemming from design choices like the selection and order of in-context examples. 

The presented work highlights that this instability arises from the varying ways in which these examples are presented. Specifically, the order of examples significantly impacts the model's performance and can lead to inconsistent results. This is a critical challenge because in-context learning relies on the model's ability to generalize from a few examples to perform new tasks. 

The research investigates the factors contributing to this instability and explores potential strategies for improving the robustness and reliability of in-context learning. By understanding and addressing the influence of example order and other design elements, the work aims to enhance the practical applicability of in-context learning for various natural language processing tasks. The ultimate goal is to create more consistent and trustworthy language models capable of effectively leveraging in-context examples.</sample>

    <sample id="280">Hello everyone, I'm Shitao. Today, it's my great honor to present my work on multimodal fusion framework for emotion regulation in conversations.

First, I'd like to briefly introduce the task of emotion regulation in conversations. The goal is to predict the emotion label of each utterance within a dialogue. Each utterance has its corresponding textual, audio, and visual modalities.

Emotion regulation in conversations is a challenging task because it requires understanding the context of the entire dialogue, as well as the nuances of human emotion. This task is important for building more natural and engaging conversational AI systems.

My work proposes a novel multimodal fusion framework that leverages information from different modalities to improve the accuracy of emotion prediction. The framework utilizes a combination of deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers, to effectively integrate and process the information from each modality.

The proposed framework has been evaluated on several benchmark datasets and has shown promising results. The results demonstrate that the framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on emotion prediction tasks.</sample>

Translation often depends on context. For example, consider the word "mole." In the sentence, "While if previous sentence was 'things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out,' then 'mole' refers to a spy. But," in the next sentence, "the mole was actually a small rodent," the meaning of "mole" changes entirely.

This presentation explores how context influences translation, using data to demonstrate the importance of understanding the surrounding text. We will examine various scenarios and analyze how different contexts affect the interpretation of words and phrases. Our goal is to highlight the dynamic nature of translation and the crucial role context plays in conveying meaning accurately. We will discuss how machine translation systems can benefit from incorporating contextual information to improve their output.</sample>

    <sample id="284">Hello everyone, I'm Peng Tianshuo from Wuhan University. Today we present my long paper for ACL 2015 titled "FSUIE: A Novel Few-Shot Learning Mechanism for Enhancing Universal Information Extraction." The current span-based UI module involves identifying and labeling the span boundaries of the target in the text, which all rely on boundary prediction.

Our work introduces a novel few-shot learning mechanism called FSUIE. FSUIE aims to improve the performance of span-based UI in scenarios with limited training data. It leverages a meta-learning approach to learn how to quickly adapt to new target spans with only a few examples. Specifically, FSUIE utilizes a contrastive learning framework to learn a representation space where similar spans are close together and dissimilar spans are far apart.

To achieve this, FSUIE employs a novel attention mechanism that focuses on the most relevant parts of the input text for span boundary prediction. We evaluate FSUIE on several benchmark datasets for information extraction and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art results with significantly fewer training examples compared to existing methods. Our experiments show that FSUIE is particularly effective in handling challenging cases with ambiguous span boundaries and noisy text.</sample>

    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Jaron Kim provide a brief overview of work on entity tracking in language models. They explain that for an agent to understand a discourse, it needs to track which entities are mentioned and how their state changes as the discourse unfolds. 

They illustrate this with an example of a recipe. In the sentence "Put the eggs, sugar, and flour in a bowl," an agent needs to recognize that "eggs," "sugar," and "flour" are all entities. The agent must also understand that these entities are being added to a "bowl," indicating a change in their state. 

The core challenge lies in accurately identifying and tracking these entities throughout a text, especially when they are referred to with variations or in different contexts. This is crucial for language models to perform tasks like question answering, summarization, and dialogue understanding effectively. The work discussed aims to improve the ability of language models to maintain a consistent understanding of entities and their relationships within a given text.</sample>

    <sample id="308">Hi everyone, I'm Jenny from First Year P.E. at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting our work on characterizing design biases in deep learning models. This work was done in collaboration with folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Sandi, Ronin Labros, Caterina Rynacka, and Martin Sap.

So, let's start by imagining that you're working for a newspaper. You're sifting through comments under your news article, trying to remove toxic language. This task is challenging because toxic language can be subtle and context-dependent.  Deep learning models, particularly those used for text generation and classification, can inadvertently learn and perpetuate these biases. 

Our research focuses on identifying and understanding these biases in models like GPT-3 and BERT. We explore how these models can generate harmful or offensive content, and we investigate the factors that contribute to these biases.  We also discuss potential mitigation strategies, such as data augmentation and adversarial training, to make these models more fair and inclusive.  Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to the development of more responsible and ethical AI systems.</sample>

    <sample id="322">Hello everyone, I'm Enrico and I'm presenting at ACL 23, answering the question: What does text classify as learn about morality?

First, let me explain what morality is. Human morality is what helps us distinguish right from wrong. It's our internal compass that helps us determine whether an action or a concept is morally right or morally wrong.

Morality is the base of our values and beliefs. It guides our behavior and shapes our understanding of the world. It's a complex and multifaceted concept, encompassing principles of fairness, justice, compassion, and responsibility.

In the context of text classification, understanding morality is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps us identify and flag potentially harmful or offensive content. Secondly, it allows us to assess the ethical implications of the text, such as bias, discrimination, or manipulation. Thirdly, it enables us to develop more nuanced and context-aware models that can better understand and respond to moral considerations.

By incorporating moral reasoning into text classification, we can create systems that are not only accurate but also responsible and ethical. This is particularly important in areas like social media, news aggregation, and content moderation, where the spread of misinformation and harmful content can have significant consequences.</sample>

    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a novel approach to compositional generalization, termed "Without Trees," leveraging multi-set tagging and latent permutations. The core idea is to enable learners to effectively handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions in data. This work is a collaborative effort with advisors Alexander Kolda and Evgeni Tittov. 

Compositional generalization refers to a model's ability to understand and generate complex structures by combining simpler elements. Traditional methods often struggle with this, particularly when dealing with hierarchical or compositional data. The "Without Trees" method aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a new framework that avoids the reliance on tree-based structures. 

The proposed approach utilizes multi-set tagging to represent the relationships between different parts of a composition and latent permutations to explore various ways these parts can be combined. This allows the model to learn more robust and generalizable representations, leading to improved performance on tasks involving complex compositional data. The paper details the methodology, experiments, and results demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in handling deeper recursion and unseen compositions.</sample>
