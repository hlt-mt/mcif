1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering diverse datasets (news articles, social media posts, etc.).

4.  **Bias Amplification/Propagation:**  Algorithms (e.g., recommendation systems, social media algorithms) that can amplify or spread pre-existing biases.
5.  **Feedback Loops:**  User interactions (likes, shares, comments) reinforce biased content, further propagating it.
6.  **Algorithmic Bias:**  Bias embedded in the algorithms themselves, leading to skewed outcomes.
7.  **Echo Chambers/Filter Bubbles:**  Personalized content feeds that limit exposure to diverse perspectives.</sample>

    <sample id="442">Existing resources for on-context-dependent translation face limitations in:

*   **Data scarcity:** High-quality, parallel data with rich contextual information is often limited, especially for low-resource languages or specialized domains.
*   **Computational complexity:** Modeling context-dependent translation requires sophisticated neural network architectures and significant computational resources (memory, processing power).
*   **Evaluation challenges:** Assessing the quality of context-dependent translations is difficult due to the subjective nature of context and the lack of readily available reference translations.
*   **Handling ambiguity:** Context can resolve ambiguity, but not all ambiguities are easily resolved, leading to potential errors.
*   **Domain adaptation:** Models trained on one domain may not generalize well to other domains with different linguistic characteristics.
*   **Long-range dependencies:** Capturing long-range dependencies within context remains a challenge for many models.</sample>

    <sample id="1310">Test reuse can exacerbate overfitting, particularly if the reused tests are not representative of the current state of the system. This can lead to inflated confidence in the model's performance on the test data, but poor generalization to unseen data. The degree of overfitting is difficult to quantify precisely, but it can be substantial, especially with limited data or complex models.</sample>

    <sample id="1348">There is no consensus on which language model is "most liberal." Different models have been trained on different datasets and exhibit varying biases.
