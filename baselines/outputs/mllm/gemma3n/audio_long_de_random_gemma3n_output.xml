    <sample id="2">Hello everyone. I'm Steve from Atlassian, and I'm here to present our times paper on document understanding. The authors of this paper are all algorithm engineers from Atlassian, and this article is derived from our walking practice.

In this paper, we will focus on the visual rich document understanding problem. It aims to address the challenges of extracting information from documents that contain a variety of visual elements, such as images, diagrams, and tables. This is a particularly difficult problem because these visual elements can be ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways.

We will discuss the different approaches that have been used to solve this problem, including deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. We will also discuss the challenges that remain and the future directions for research in this area.

We hope that this paper will be of interest to researchers and practitioners who are working on document understanding.</sample>

    <sample id="6">Hello everyone, I'm Jian, and I'm so excited to present our work towards unifying multi-lingual and cross-lingual summarization. This is a joint work with Fundong, Duo, Yunlong, Zhixu, Jianfeng, and Jie.

First, let's summarize our contributions in this work. We unified multi-lingual summarization and cross-lingual summarization into a more general setting named Multi-lingual Summarization. Multi-lingual summarization is a task of generating a concise and informative summary of a document in a target language, while cross-lingual summarization is a task of generating a summary of a document in one language in another language.

Our work proposes a novel framework that leverages a shared multilingual encoder to effectively capture cross-lingual information and generate high-quality summaries. We introduce a new attention mechanism that allows the model to attend to both the source and target languages, enabling it to better understand the semantic relationships between them.

We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art results on both multi-lingual and cross-lingual summarization tasks. Our results show that our approach is effective in generating accurate and fluent summaries in multiple languages.</sample>

    <sample id="11">Hi everyone, my name is Jack Hessel and I'm a research scientist at AI2. I'm super excited to be here today to present Do Androids Laugh? A humor understanding benchmark from the New Yorker Caption Contest. This is joint work with a lot of awesome collaborators from the University of Utah, Cornell University, University of Washington, Emu Mail and OpenAI.

Have you heard the news? Large language models can now generate and even explain jokes. If you log on to ChatGPT and ask it to tell you a joke, it might do so.

This presentation introduces a new benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models to understand and respond to humor. The benchmark is based on a dataset of captions generated by humans for New Yorker cartoons. We designed a set of prompts that ask models to not only generate captions but also to explain why a particular caption is funny.

Our results show that while large language models can generate plausible captions, they often struggle to understand the underlying humor. We also found that models can sometimes provide nonsensical or irrelevant explanations for why a caption is funny. This work highlights the challenges of evaluating humor understanding in large language models and suggests directions for future research.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Hello everybody, my name is Daniel Rotem, and I will be presenting my work, "Finding the Sweet Spot: Analysis and Improvement of Adaptive Inference in Low-Resource Settings," which was done in Professor Roish Warsh's lab at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Adaptive inference is a method for reducing the inference time of large language models. To use it, we rely on the fact that real-world data varies in complexity. Therefore, we can use low-capacity models for tasks where the input data is simple. However, for more complex tasks, we can use larger models.

Our work focuses on finding the optimal balance between model size and inference time in low-resource settings. We analyze the performance of different models on a variety of tasks and identify the sweet spot where we can achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and speed.

We also propose a new method for adapting inference to low-resource settings. This method allows us to dynamically adjust the size of the model being used based on the complexity of the input data. This can significantly improve the efficiency of inference without sacrificing accuracy.

Our results show that adaptive inference can be an effective way to reduce the inference time of large language models in low-resource settings. We believe that this work has the potential to make large language models more accessible and practical for a wider range of applications.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Relation extraction is a widely explored task aiming to identify semantic relationships between entities in text. However, in real-world scenarios like social media, data often exists in diverse forms and modalities beyond pure text. This work investigates the challenges of relation extraction in such complex data. We explore methods to effectively extract relationships from multimodal data, considering the interplay between textual, visual, and potentially other information. Our research addresses the need for robust and adaptable approaches that can handle the heterogeneity of real-world data sources. We propose a framework that leverages deep learning techniques to model these complex relationships, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of relation extraction in diverse contexts. The goal is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships expressed in multimodal data, which has significant implications for various downstream applications such as knowledge graph construction and information retrieval.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Hi, I'm Jian Garrett, and I'm going to talk about our work on improving the ability for text-to-image models to render visual text. Text-to-image modeling research has made huge strides in the last year, with the ability to generate very high-quality, interesting images. However, a lot of people have noticed that these models are often very bad at representing text.

We specifically work at the Imagen model, which works by taking the input text and coding it with a T5 encoder. This encoder is a powerful language model that can understand and generate text. The Imagen model then uses this encoded text to generate an image.

Our work focuses on improving the quality and fidelity of the generated text. We have developed a new training technique that allows the model to better understand the nuances of language and to generate text that is more accurate and visually appealing. We have also explored different ways of incorporating text into the image generation process.

We believe that our work has the potential to significantly improve the quality of text-to-image models and to make them more useful for a wide range of applications.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The paper introduces Blender, a simple yet effective open-source boundary framework for large language models. Its key idea lies in sparse pairwise ranking and generative fusion. The authors are a team from AI2 and UC Berkeley, and their name is Yuchen Lin.

The paper highlights the increasing number of large language models released regularly, many claiming strong performance. However, the authors argue that not all models achieve the same level of quality. Blender aims to address this by focusing on efficient and effective methods for handling the complexities of large language models.

The framework utilizes sparse pairwise ranking to identify the most relevant information and generative fusion to combine these pieces of information in a way that enhances the model's capabilities. This approach allows for better performance and efficiency compared to traditional methods.

The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of Blender in various tasks. The authors show that Blender can achieve competitive or even superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art models while being more computationally efficient.

In conclusion, Blender offers a promising new approach to building and training large language models, focusing on sparsity and generative fusion to achieve better performance and efficiency.</sample>

So, let's say we have an input like this one, for which the classifier predicts a particular decision. There are many methods for interpreting this decision. One class of methods uses selective rationalization, which provides explanations by highlighting input tokens that have a significant effect on the prediction.

This method identifies the most influential parts of the input that led to the classifier's decision. By highlighting these tokens, it allows users to understand *why* the model made a specific prediction. This is particularly useful for debugging models, understanding their behavior, and building trust in their outputs.

Selective rationalization can be applied to various types of models, including those based on transformers. It offers a way to make complex models more transparent and interpretable, which is crucial for applications where understanding the reasoning behind a decision is important.</sample>
    <sample id="36">Willkommen zu WCL. Ich bin Tom Sopech und dies ist ein Sneak Peek in die Lern-Layer für mehrsprachige maschinelle Übersetzung. Gemeinsam mit Robin Schmidt, Eishuiao und Stefan Bytes.

Mehrsprachige maschinelle Übersetzung hat mehrere Vorteile, nämlich Skalierbarkeit, da es einfacher ist, ein einzelnes Modell für mehrere Sprachen zu trainieren und zu warten, anstatt ein separates Modell für jede Sprache zu haben. Geschwindigkeit, da man direkt zwischen beliebigen Sprachen übersetzen kann, anstatt zwischen den Sprachen hin und her zu müssen.

Die Arbeit konzentriert sich auf die Entwicklung von mehrsprachigen Modellen, die auf einer Reihe von Layern basieren, die auf die spezifischen Anforderungen der mehrsprachigen Übersetzung zugeschnitten sind. Diese Layern ermöglichen es dem Modell, die verschiedenen Sprachen zu verstehen und zu verarbeiten, was zu einer verbesserten Genauigkeit und Leistung führt.

Das Projekt zielt darauf ab, die Grenzen der mehrsprachigen maschinellen Übersetzung zu erweitern und neue Möglichkeiten für die Kommunikation und das Verständnis zwischen Menschen mit unterschiedlichen Sprachen zu schaffen.</sample>

Maintaining coherent and engaging narratives, such as dialogues or stories, requires natural language processing systems to understand how the personalities of speakers, listeners, or characters ground the narrative. Peacock is a system designed to provide this commonsense knowledge. It aims to enhance the quality of generated text by incorporating relevant background information and common sense reasoning.

The system leverages a large-scale knowledge graph and a neural network to infer the relationships between entities and events in a narrative. This allows Peacock to generate more realistic and consistent text, making it suitable for applications like dialogue generation, story writing, and virtual assistants.

Peacock has been evaluated on several benchmarks and has shown promising results in terms of narrative coherence and engagement. The collaboration with Sony Group Corporation further validates the potential of Peacock for real-world applications in entertainment and communication.</sample>

    <sample id="54">Cognitive dissonance, the discomfort arising from holding conflicting beliefs or performing actions inconsistent with those beliefs, is a significant challenge in language processing. This paper investigates transfer learning for distant detection, addressing the rare class problem. We begin by defining cognitive dissonance and its importance in language study. Specifically, cognitive dissonance occurs when individuals hold two or more conflicting beliefs or when their actions contradict their beliefs. This creates psychological tension, motivating individuals to reduce the dissonance. In the context of language, this can manifest as changes in beliefs or behaviors to align with perceived inconsistencies. We explore how transfer learning can be leveraged to improve the detection of rare classes in distant detection tasks, a crucial area in natural language processing. Our approach aims to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and effectively handle the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets.</sample>

As we all know, natural language generation (NLG) systems are based on large language models. These models have become larger and more complex, leading to significantly slower performance and substantial financial costs.

This paper investigates knowledge distillation as a method to improve the efficiency of NLG models. Knowledge distillation involves training a smaller "student" model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more powerful "teacher" model. The authors explore various techniques for knowledge distillation in the context of NLG, focusing on pseudo-target training.

Their experiments demonstrate that knowledge distillation can effectively reduce the computational cost and latency of NLG systems without sacrificing performance. They present a systematic study of different distillation strategies and analyze their impact on various NLG tasks.

The findings suggest that knowledge distillation is a promising approach for developing more efficient and accessible NLG systems, paving the way for wider adoption in various applications.</sample>

    <sample id="84">Today, I'm going to talk about my paper in ACL 2023, titled "Pan-Language Information Framework for Multilingual Models."

First, I want to talk about background knowledge about multilingual models. Most of the traditional multilingual models are static multilingual models, giving you the value of the model. The model can compute it.

However, the current multilingual models are often trained on a fixed set of languages. This means that they may not perform well on languages that are not included in their training data. This is a major limitation of multilingual models.

To address this limitation, we propose a new framework called Pan-Language Information Framework. This framework allows multilingual models to learn information from a wider range of languages. By using a shared representation space, we can enable multilingual models to transfer knowledge between languages.

Our framework is based on the idea of using a shared embedding space for all languages. This allows the model to learn common representations of words and phrases across languages. By using this shared representation space, we can improve the performance of multilingual models on a wider range of languages.

We evaluate our framework on a variety of multilingual tasks, including machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, and cross-lingual question answering. Our results show that our framework significantly improves the performance of multilingual models on these tasks.</sample>

The article highlights the lack of monolingual native speakers for many languages, citing an example of only 73,000 native speakers for one language. This scarcity poses a significant hurdle for developing and improving language models for these languages.

The author suggests that leveraging language learners as data annotators could be a viable solution. While acknowledging potential challenges, the article implies that this approach offers a promising avenue for overcoming the data scarcity issue and advancing language technology for a wider range of languages.

It's my pleasure to give you a short advertisement video of our paper: "Are you copying my model? Protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding and services." We'll back do watermark.

Let's first introduce the background about embedding services. Currently, large language models such as GPT, Llama, PaLM, and others have become widely used in various natural language processing tasks. However, the open availability of these models has led to concerns about potential misuse, such as unauthorized copying and distribution.

To address this issue, we have developed a novel embedding service that provides a way to protect the copyright of large language models. Our service embeds the model into a secure and private environment, allowing users to access the model's capabilities without directly accessing the model itself. This approach helps to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution while still enabling users to benefit from the model's performance.

Our embedding service is designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing applications. We also provide a range of customization options to meet the specific needs of our users. We believe that our embedding service can play a key role in ensuring the responsible use of large language models and protecting the intellectual property of the developers.</sample>

    <sample id="100">Multi-hop QA is a question answering system designed for complex queries requiring multiple reasoning steps. Each "jump" in the reasoning process corresponds to a document within a large corpus of text. For example, to answer the question "What 1988 Christmas comedy film did Brian Doyle Murray star in?", the system would first identify all movies featuring Brian Doyle Murray and then select the one released in 1988.

The system operates by breaking down complex questions into a series of simpler, sequential steps. Each step involves retrieving relevant information from the corpus and using it to refine the search for the answer. This allows the system to handle questions that require inference, comparison, or synthesis of information from multiple sources.

Multi-hop QA is particularly useful for tasks such as identifying relationships between entities, finding specific details within a large amount of text, and answering questions that require a deep understanding of the context. The system's ability to perform multiple reasoning steps makes it a powerful tool for information retrieval and question answering in various domains.</sample>

    <sample id="108">The paper "Language Model Acceptability Judgments Are Not Always Robust to Context" by Goosens et al. explores the limitations of current language model acceptability judgments. The authors revisit the minimal pair paradigm, a method used to evaluate language models by comparing their outputs with and without small changes to the input. 

The study finds that these minimal pair experiments are not always reliable indicators of a language model's overall acceptability. The results suggest that the context in which a language model generates text significantly influences its perceived acceptability, and simple minimal pair comparisons may not capture this nuanced relationship. 

The paper highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation methods that consider the broader context of language use. It argues that relying solely on minimal pair experiments can lead to misleading conclusions about the robustness and reliability of language models. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges in evaluating language models and suggest directions for future research in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The provided text discusses instruction tuning for language models, a technique that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks with minimal human labeling. A key method for obtaining examples for instruction tuning is to reformulate existing NLP datasets. However, the data generated from this approach is restricted to existing academic benchmarks. In contrast, instructions can be used to describe any textual task.

The text highlights the limitations of using reformulated NLP datasets for instruction tuning. While this method is a common approach, it doesn't fully leverage the potential of instructions to describe a wider range of tasks. The core idea of instruction tuning is to train language models on a diverse set of instructions, enabling them to perform various tasks effectively without requiring extensive task-specific labeled data. This approach offers a more flexible and adaptable way to train language models compared to relying solely on existing datasets.</sample>

    <sample id="123">Hello everyone, my name is Ying and my colleague Zhiyang and I will be presenting our research on prompting instruction improving model zero-shot learning via instruction tuning.

With the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way. Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform well on a variety of tasks with minimal fine-tuning.

Instruction tuning involves training a language model on a diverse set of instructions and corresponding outputs. This allows the model to learn to follow instructions effectively, even for tasks it has not been explicitly trained on. The benefits of instruction tuning include improved zero-shot performance, reduced data requirements, and increased model flexibility.

Our research investigates the effectiveness of instruction tuning for improving zero-shot learning in a specific domain. We evaluate several instruction tuning methods and compare their performance to a baseline model. Our results show that instruction tuning can significantly improve zero-shot performance, even with a small amount of training data. We also discuss the challenges and limitations of instruction tuning and suggest directions for future research.</sample>
    <sample id="124">Hello everyone, this is Tanchi from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba. I'm glad to share our work towards benchmarking and improving the temporal reasoning capability of our LMs.

Time is a fundamental axis in the real world. We first break down temporal reasoning into three different levels. The first level is time-to-time reasoning, such as "What is a year after 2010?". Answering this question will only need the understanding of the time axis.

The second level is event-to-event reasoning. This involves understanding the order and relationships between events. For example, "What happened before the meeting?". This requires understanding the sequence of events and their causal relationships.

The third level is temporal reasoning with multiple events. This involves reasoning about the timing of multiple events and their interactions. For example, "If the train leaves at 8 am and the meeting starts at 9 am, will I be able to make it?". This requires understanding the timing of multiple events and their dependencies.

Our work focuses on developing and evaluating models that can perform these different levels of temporal reasoning. We have developed a benchmark dataset and a set of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of different models. We are also exploring new techniques to improve the temporal reasoning capabilities of LMs.</sample>

Currently, this method is only effective with massive models like GPT-3 or PaLM. This paper explores a novel approach to enhance reasoning capabilities in smaller language models. The authors propose a method to improve the efficiency and applicability of chain-of-thought reasoning by focusing on a more streamlined and adaptable architecture.

Their work introduces a new way to structure the reasoning process, aiming to reduce the computational burden associated with generating extensive intermediate steps. This is achieved through a combination of architectural modifications and training strategies. The goal is to make chain-of-thought reasoning more accessible and practical for a wider range of language models, not just the largest ones.

The research demonstrates that their proposed method can significantly improve the performance of smaller language models on various reasoning tasks, bringing them closer to the capabilities of their larger counterparts. This work contributes to the broader field of natural language processing by addressing a key challenge in scaling reasoning abilities to more resource-constrained models.</sample>

Let's get started.

So, what's the motivation behind this work? So, there are lots of real-world applications for numerical reasoning, and you also have lots of downstream tasks that require the factual correctness of numerical information.

    <sample id="146">Hi everyone, I'm Zou Yicheng, a PhD student from Fudan University. Now I will give you a talk about our paper on analysis of omission in dialogue summarization.

First, I'm going to briefly introduce the background of dialogue summarization. Dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization. It is the process of creating a concise summary that represents the most important information within a dialogue.

There are many scenarios in dialogue summarization. For example, in a customer service call, the summary might focus on the customer's issue and the resolution. In a meeting, the summary might highlight the key decisions and action items. In a news report, the summary might focus on the main points of the conversation.

Dialogue summarization is a challenging task because it requires understanding the context of the dialogue, identifying the most important information, and generating a concise and coherent summary. There are many different approaches to dialogue summarization, including extractive summarization, abstractive summarization, and hybrid summarization.

Our paper focuses on analyzing the omission in dialogue summarization. We investigate the types of omissions that occur in dialogue summaries and the factors that influence them. We also propose a new method for mitigating these omissions.</sample>

In this presentation titled "Exploring Large Language Models for Classical Philology," I will introduce valuable resources for ancient Greek and Latin. Moreover, we will explore the implications and challenges of multilinguality in these models. Before we dive in, let's take a quick look at the current landscape of language models in classics. They have been developed using various techniques, including statistical methods and neural networks. These models have shown promising results in tasks such as text generation, translation, and question answering. However, there are also several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the lack of large amounts of training data for classical languages. Another challenge is the difficulty of capturing the nuances of classical language, such as syntax and semantics. Despite these challenges, there is a lot of potential for language models to revolutionize the study of classical languages.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Hello, my name is Nina Mehrabi. I am a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Alexa AI, and I will present our work resolving ambiguities in text-to-image generative models.

In this work, we are interested in studying existing ambiguities in prompts provided to text-to-image models. For instance, the following prompt is ambiguous because it can have various different interpretations: "a girl in a red dress". The ambiguity lies in the specific details of the girl, such as her age, ethnicity, hairstyle, and the context of the dress. Similarly, the prompt "a cat sitting on a mat" is ambiguous because the type of cat, the material of the mat, and the surrounding environment are not specified.

Our research aims to develop methods to reduce these ambiguities and improve the quality and consistency of the generated images. We explore various techniques, including prompt engineering, model training, and incorporating additional information into the prompts. The goal is to create text-to-image models that can generate more accurate and predictable images based on the given text descriptions. This work has the potential to significantly advance the field of artificial intelligence and enable more creative and user-friendly applications of text-to-image technology.</sample>

Dialogue summarization aims at distilling salient information from a dialogue context into a concise summary. This work introduces a novel framework that leverages both static and dynamic aspects of dialogue structure to enhance summarization performance. The framework utilizes a fusion graph to represent the relationships between different dialogue turns and entities, capturing both the overall coherence and the local relevance of the conversation.

The proposed method incorporates a graph neural network to learn node embeddings that reflect the semantic and structural information of the dialogue. These embeddings are then used to generate a summary by selecting the most important nodes and their connections in the graph. Experiments on several benchmark dialogue datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</sample>
    <sample id="158">Hi, my name is Xiangguanhu Rong AWS. Today I want to introduce a work: Docast for long document neural reference resolution.

So, let me first introduce the task of reference resolution.
The entities in a document may have multiple mentions across the text.
The reference resolution task is to identify the mentions and cluster the mentions that refer to the same entity.

In this work, we propose Docast, a novel neural approach for reference resolution in long documents. Docast leverages a combination of transformer-based encoders and a clustering algorithm to effectively identify and group mentions referring to the same entity.

The proposed method addresses the challenges of long documents by utilizing a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies between mentions. Furthermore, Docast incorporates a novel clustering strategy that considers both semantic similarity and contextual information to ensure accurate entity linking.

Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Docast achieves state-of-the-art performance on reference resolution tasks. The results show that Docast is able to effectively identify and cluster mentions referring to the same entity in long documents, even when the mentions are far apart in the text.</sample>

    <sample id="165">Hello everyone. I'm excited to be here to present our research paper titled "Adaptive Commonsense Reasoning: Exploiting Mutually Exclusive Explanations." My name is Wenting Zhao, and I'm a PhD student at Cornell University.

Before diving into our approach to adaptive reasoning, I will first provide a concrete example to help illustrate what it means. Followed by a more formal definition.

Our research focuses on adaptive commonsense reasoning, which aims to improve the ability of AI systems to make inferences based on common sense knowledge. Traditional approaches often rely on static knowledge bases, but these can be incomplete or outdated. Adaptive reasoning systems, on the other hand, can dynamically adjust their reasoning based on the available information and the context of the situation.

We propose a novel framework that leverages mutually exclusive explanations to achieve adaptive reasoning. This framework allows the system to consider multiple possible explanations for a given event, and to prioritize those explanations that are mutually exclusive – meaning that they cannot both be true. By focusing on mutually exclusive explanations, we can avoid ambiguity and improve the accuracy of our reasoning.

Our experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to significant improvements in performance on a variety of commonsense reasoning tasks. We believe that our work has the potential to advance the field of AI and to create more intelligent and robust systems.</sample>

**Abstract:**

This work introduces a novel approach to constrained language planning by distilling script knowledge from large language models (LLMs). LLMs have shown promise in planning for abstract goals, but their planning often lacks the grounded, step-by-step nature of human actions. We propose a method to extract and condense the script knowledge learned by LLMs into a more structured and controllable format. This distilled script knowledge can then be used to guide planning in constrained environments, ensuring that the generated plans are more realistic and aligned with human intentions. Our approach aims to bridge the gap between the high-level planning capabilities of LLMs and the detailed, grounded planning required for everyday tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="192">Today, I'm giving a short presentation on our work, which focuses on the development of the adaptive gradient-based optimization method for the confidence scaling of large language models.

Currently, the training of large language models often relies on adaptive gradient-based optimization methods. However, some widely used optimizers like Adam have limitations. Our research aims to address these limitations by proposing a novel adaptive gradient-based optimization method specifically designed for confidence scaling in large language models.

This method leverages the concept of confidence scaling to improve the training process and enhance the performance of large language models. By carefully adjusting the learning rate based on the confidence of the model's predictions, we can achieve more stable and efficient training.

Our approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of large language models, making them more suitable for a wider range of applications. We believe that our work can contribute to the advancement of the field of natural language processing and help to unlock the full potential of large language models.</sample>

    <sample id="195">Hello everyone. Today I will introduce our work, reasoning over a hierarchical question decomposition tree for explainable question answering. Explainable question answering (QA) means to answer a given question and provide an explanation why the answer is selected. Recent work in QA can be grouped into two directions: neuro-symbolic methods, which translate natural language questions into formal representations such as Sparkle, and knowledge-based methods, which leverage external knowledge sources like Wikipedia or ConceptNet to answer questions.

Neuro-symbolic methods combine the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning. Neural networks are good at learning patterns from data, while symbolic reasoning is good at manipulating knowledge. By combining these two approaches, neuro-symbolic methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of QA tasks.

Knowledge-based methods leverage external knowledge sources to answer questions. These methods can be used to answer questions that require factual knowledge, such as questions about history or science. Knowledge-based methods are also useful for answering questions that require common sense reasoning.

Both neuro-symbolic and knowledge-based methods have their strengths and weaknesses. Neuro-symbolic methods are generally more flexible and can handle a wider range of questions. Knowledge-based methods are generally more accurate and can provide more detailed answers.</sample>

The research investigates how these prevalent political biases embedded in the training data can lead to unfair or biased language models. By tracking the trajectory of these biases, the study aims to understand the potential consequences for various applications of language models.

Now, I want to talk about our works in following seven aspects. I will introduce our motivations first.

Our research focuses on the generation of multi-turn controllable dialogue, a challenging task in natural language processing. We aim to develop methods that can generate coherent and engaging conversations with fine-grained control over the dialogue flow. This work is motivated by the increasing demand for intelligent conversational agents in various applications, such as customer service, education, and entertainment.

We have explored various approaches to compositional dialogue generation, including neural network models, reinforcement learning, and knowledge-based methods. Our work also focuses on controllable dialogue generation, where we can specify certain attributes or constraints for the generated dialogue.

We have achieved promising results in several experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods in generating high-quality and controllable dialogues. We believe that our work has the potential to significantly advance the field of conversational AI.</sample>

    <sample id="222">The title of this work is "To Adapt or to Annotate: Challenges and Interventions in Open Domain Question Answering." To motivate this work, let's look at the question: "What is produced in the plants of Narorara, Kakrapur, Tarapur?" In an open-domain QA setting, we need to first look up relevant passages from a document corpus, in this case, Wikipedia, with some retrieval model. Then, a reader model takes the question and all the relevant passages as input. The reader model then needs to identify the answer within the passages. This is a challenging task because the answer may not be explicitly stated in the passages, and the reader model may need to infer it from the context. The work explores various challenges in open-domain QA and proposes different interventions to address these challenges. These interventions include using more sophisticated retrieval models, developing better reader models, and incorporating external knowledge. The goal of the work is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of open-domain QA systems.</sample>

    <sample id="227">Recent advancements in language models have led to significant progress in various NLP tasks. However, a key area of ongoing research is the lack of true grounding in current language models. This refers to the ability to connect natural language expressions to concrete, executable actions within a specific environment, often referred to as a plan or program.

The core challenge lies in bridging the gap between the abstract world of language and the physical or digital world. Current models often operate on symbolic representations, lacking the ability to understand and interact with the real world in a meaningful way. This limitation hinders their ability to perform complex tasks that require reasoning about physical constraints, object manipulation, or environmental context.

Researchers are exploring various approaches to address this gap, including incorporating visual and other sensory data, developing more robust reasoning mechanisms, and designing models that can learn from interaction with their environment. The goal is to create language models that are not just fluent in language but also capable of understanding and acting upon the world around them, paving the way for more intelligent and versatile AI systems.</sample>

This paper investigates the role of attention mechanisms in facilitating this complex cognitive process. It examines how attention can be utilized to focus on relevant linguistic information while filtering out noise, thereby improving the accuracy and fluency of the translated output. The research delves into the challenges of ST, such as managing information overload and maintaining coherence, and proposes attention-based strategies to address these issues.

The picture in the middle shows a two-step pipeline for finding high agreement Amazon Mechanical Turk workers because MTurk occurs. The motivation of the pipeline is that automatic metrics are sometimes problematic and do not accurately reflect human judgment.

The first step of the pipeline is to identify potential high-agreement workers. This is done by using a set of tasks that are designed to be easily evaluated by humans. The second step of the pipeline is to evaluate the performance of the potential high-agreement workers. This is done by having a group of human evaluators rate the performance of the workers on a set of tasks.

The results of the pipeline show that there are a number of high-agreement workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. These workers are able to perform a variety of tasks with high accuracy.

    <sample id="263">Today, we're presenting our work on mitigating label biases for in-context learning. In-context learning is a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models, but its stability is often a concern due to design choices like the order of in-context examples. Our work demonstrates that this instability stems from the presence of various biases within the in-context examples themselves. These biases can manifest as skewed representations of certain concepts or relationships, leading to unpredictable and potentially unfair model behavior. 

We propose a novel approach to identify and address these biases by analyzing the statistical properties of the in-context examples. Our method leverages techniques from natural language processing to detect and quantify the presence of bias, allowing for targeted interventions to improve the robustness and fairness of in-context learning. By mitigating these biases, we aim to unlock the full potential of in-context learning for a wider range of applications.</sample>

This task is crucial for understanding and responding appropriately to the emotional state of the speaker. The paper focuses on the multimodal fusion framework for emotion regulation in conversations, leveraging both textual, audio, and visual modalities.

The proposed framework aims to effectively integrate information from these different sources to improve emotion prediction accuracy. It utilizes a combination of deep learning techniques, including attention mechanisms and transformer architectures, to capture the complex relationships between modalities and the context of the conversation.

The paper presents experimental results on a benchmark dataset for emotion regulation in conversations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal fusion framework. The results show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing approaches.

The current span-based UI module in information extraction involves identifying and labeling the span boundaries of the target in the text. These boundaries are based on boundary prediction.

Our work introduces a novel few-shot learning mechanism called FSUIE. FSUIE aims to improve the performance of span-based UI in scenarios with limited labeled data. We propose a meta-learning approach that allows the model to quickly adapt to new target spans with only a few examples.

FSUIE leverages a combination of span prediction and boundary prediction, and it incorporates a novel attention mechanism to focus on the most relevant parts of the text. We evaluate FSUIE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot information extraction.

Our findings show that FSUIE can effectively leverage limited labeled data to improve the accuracy and robustness of span-based UI. We believe that FSUIE has the potential to be a valuable tool for information extraction in various real-world applications.</sample>
    <sample id="285">Hello everyone, I'm Mingjie from Peking University. I'm glad to share our work on reference matters, benchmarking, factual error correction for data summarization with fine-grained evaluation framework. This video focuses on the key points of our work.

As we all know, summaries are generally generated by models and even some reference summaries still contain factual errors. There are two main types of solutions. The first is to introduce a new method for factual error correction. We propose a novel approach that leverages the concept of knowledge graphs to identify and correct factual errors in generated summaries. This method involves constructing a knowledge graph from the source document and the generated summary, and then using the knowledge graph to verify the factual consistency of the summary.

The second is to improve the evaluation framework for data summarization. We propose a new evaluation metric that considers both the fluency and the factual accuracy of the generated summaries. This metric is based on a combination of automatic metrics and human evaluation. We also introduce a new set of benchmark datasets for evaluating the performance of data summarization models.

Our work has the potential to improve the quality of data summarization and make it more reliable. We believe that our findings will be valuable to the research community and industry practitioners.</sample>

    <sample id="297">The provided text discusses the concept of "dog whistles" in political discourse, using an example of a speech given by Senator Josh Hawley. Hawley's speech, where he criticizes the "cultural elite" agenda, is interpreted by some as a coded message targeting "Jewish people."

The text explains that "dog whistles" are phrases or terms that are intentionally vague or indirect, designed to appeal to a specific group without explicitly stating their views. The term "dog whistle" originated from the practice of using coded language to communicate with a particular audience, often to subtly express discriminatory or prejudiced sentiments.

The example of Hawley's speech highlights how seemingly innocuous language can be interpreted as a veiled attack on a minority group. This raises concerns about the potential for political rhetoric to be used to promote division and prejudice. The text suggests that understanding the nuances of language and the potential for coded messaging is crucial for critically analyzing political discourse.</sample>

    <sample id="299">Hello everyone, my name is Hal S. Raj. Today, we're here to discuss improving zero-shot and few-shot language models with minimal training. This is John's work with Andrew Haus, at the University of Cambridge.

Large language models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a lot of benchmarks. However, despite rapid progress, recent work has demonstrated that the success of these models is partly due to learning and using shortcuts.

This presentation will explore the challenges and opportunities in training these models more efficiently. We will discuss techniques for improving zero-shot and few-shot performance with limited data. We will also examine the role of meta-learning and prompt engineering in achieving better results.

The goal of this talk is to provide insights into how we can make language models more accessible and effective for a wider range of applications. We will cover recent research findings and discuss potential future directions in this field.</sample>
    <sample id="300">Hi, my name is Blender, and the workout we're presenting today introduces a task called interactive dictation and makes initial steps towards solving this task. There's work done at some machines in collaboration with Jason Eisner, Adam Pauls, and Sam Thompson.

So, what is interactive dictation? At a high level, interactive dictation is a process where users can use their voice to both dictate and edit a document in a natural and intuitive manner. In this system, the user's voice is recognized and transcribed into text, and then the user can use voice commands to make corrections and edits to the text. This allows for a more efficient and hands-free way to create and modify documents.

The system utilizes a combination of speech recognition and natural language processing techniques. The speech recognition component converts the user's spoken words into text, while the natural language processing component allows for more sophisticated editing and correction of the text. The goal is to create a system that is both accurate and easy to use, allowing users to quickly and easily create and edit documents using their voice.</sample>

    <sample id="306">Hello everyone, I'm Sebastian Schuster and together with Najon Kim, I'm going to give you a short overview of a work on entity tracking in language models.

For an agent to understand a discourse, it needs to track which entities are mentioned and how their state changes as the discourse unfolds. For example, in the context of a recipe, such as here, an agent has to understand that putting the eggs, sugar, and flour in a bowl results in all of these three entities.

The work focuses on the challenge of entity tracking in language models, which is crucial for agents to effectively understand and interact with natural language. Entity tracking involves identifying and categorizing entities mentioned in text, and also tracking how these entities evolve over time within a conversation or document.

The authors propose a novel approach to entity tracking that leverages the capabilities of large language models. Their method aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of entity tracking by incorporating contextual information and reasoning capabilities of these models. The work demonstrates the potential of large language models for building more intelligent and capable agents that can better understand and respond to natural language.</sample>

    <sample id="308">Hi everyone, I'm Jenny from First Year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting our work and a novel positionality. Characterizing design biases in deep learning models. This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Sandi, Ronin Libros, Katarina Rynacka, and Martin Sap.

So, let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper. You're sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic language. This task is challenging because toxic language is often subtle and can be expressed in various ways. Traditional methods for detecting toxic language often rely on keyword lists or simple machine learning models, which can be easily bypassed by users who are skilled at using euphemisms or code words.

Our work proposes a novel approach to characterizing design biases in deep learning models that can contribute to the generation of toxic language. We introduce a new method for analyzing the internal representations of these models to identify patterns that correlate with toxicity. By examining how the model processes different types of input, we can gain insights into the biases that may be present and how they can be mitigated.

Our findings suggest that deep learning models can learn to associate certain concepts or phrases with negative sentiment, even if those concepts or phrases are not explicitly toxic themselves. This can lead to the generation of toxic language in downstream applications. We believe that our work can contribute to the development of more robust and ethical deep learning models.</sample>

Text classification is a task in natural language processing where the goal is to assign a predefined category or label to a given piece of text. This is a fundamental problem in many applications, including information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and question answering.

There are several approaches to text classification, including traditional machine learning methods like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines, as well as deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results on many text classification benchmarks.

The choice of the best approach depends on the specific task and the available data. For example, if the dataset is small, a traditional machine learning method may be sufficient. However, if the dataset is large and the task is complex, a deep learning model may be necessary.

Text classification is a rapidly evolving field, and new techniques are constantly being developed. As the amount of text data continues to grow, text classification will become even more important.</sample>
    <sample id="323">Hello everyone, I am Yu Jia Wang from Shanxi University of China. The title of my paper is "Dynamic Tick: A Language Model for Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense QA".

Commonsense QA is a challenging task that requires a message to answer questions that rely on common knowledge to test their language understanding.

This paper proposes a novel approach to commonsense question answering by leveraging a language model to represent knowledge. The model is trained on a large corpus of text and is able to generate answers to questions that require common sense reasoning.

The proposed approach is evaluated on a set of benchmark datasets and shows that it outperforms existing methods. The results demonstrate the potential of language models for knowledge representation learning and commonsense question answering.

In this work, we focus on zero-shot video sentence localization. Video sentence localization aims to find the most relevant segments in a video given a natural language query for those videos. We have developed a novel approach that leverages a pre-trained video-text model to achieve this task. Our method can effectively identify the segments that best correspond to the given query, even without explicit training data for those specific queries.

We evaluated our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing the semantic content of videos based on textual descriptions. The results show that our zero-shot video sentence localization method achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. This work has the potential to significantly improve video understanding and retrieval systems, enabling users to easily find relevant video content based on their natural language queries.</sample>

    <sample id="337">Hello everyone, it's my professor, Dr. Zhou. Today, we're discussing a relationship mining book contest focused on the application of embedding learning. In this speech, I will provide an overview of our research and highlight its key contributions.

It is well-known that the author of "Caber" was always a difficult representative, while critical trouble performance of embedding-based tasks is still a major problem. Our research aims to address this issue by proposing a novel embedding learning method that leverages the concept of "Caber" to improve the performance of embedding-based tasks.

Our method introduces a new loss function that encourages the embeddings to be more similar to the original data. This is achieved by incorporating a regularization term that penalizes the difference between the embeddings and the original data. We have evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets and have shown that it significantly outperforms existing methods.

In addition to improving the performance of embedding-based tasks, our method also has several other advantages. It is simple to implement and can be easily integrated into existing systems. It is also computationally efficient and does not require large amounts of data.

We believe that our research has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of embedding learning. We are excited about the future of our work and look forward to seeing the impact it will have on the field.</sample>

Heute möchte ich Ihnen eine kurze Einführung in unsere Arbeit zur kompositorischen Generalisierung ohne Bäume geben, unter Verwendung von Multi-Set-Tagging und latenten Permutationen. Dies ist eine gemeinsame Arbeit mit meinen Betreuern Alexander Kolda und Evgeni Tikhonov.

Kompositorische Generalisierung kann als die Fähigkeit eines Lerners verstanden werden, tiefere Rekursionen und unbekannte Kompositionen zu verarbeiten. Im Wesentlichen geht es darum, dass ein Modell in der Lage ist, neue, bisher nicht gesehenen Strukturen zu verstehen und zu generieren, ohne auf die Verwendung von Baumstrukturen angewiesen zu sein.

Unsere Arbeit untersucht, wie Multi-Set-Tagging und latente Permutationen verwendet werden können, um diese Generalisierung zu erreichen. Multi-Set-Tagging ermöglicht es dem Modell, verschiedene Arten von Beziehungen zwischen Elementen in einer Komposition zu lernen, während latente Permutationen die Reihenfolge der Elemente in einer Komposition flexibel gestalten können.

Durch die Kombination dieser Techniken können wir Modelle entwickeln, die eine robustere und flexiblere Verarbeitung von Kompositionen ermöglichen. Dies hat das Potenzial, in einer Vielzahl von Anwendungen eingesetzt zu werden, darunter Bildverarbeitung, natürliche Sprachverarbeitung und Musikgenerierung.</sample>

    <sample id="350">Hello everyone and welcome to the presentation of our paper entitled "What is the Meaning of Superhuman Performance in Today's NLP?". I am Simone Todeski and this is a joint work with several renowned researchers from many institutions around the world.

So, in the last five years, leaderboard-based evaluation became the de facto standard in NLP, and consequently, the metric of objective became to reach the top spot in popular benchmarks. Not infrequently, it happens that systems achieve human-level or even superhuman performance in such benchmarks.

However, this focus on achieving the highest score often leads to a narrow definition of what constitutes "performance." While impressive results in specific benchmarks are noteworthy, they don't necessarily reflect a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of these systems.

Our paper explores this issue by examining the meaning of superhuman performance in the context of NLP. We argue that simply achieving a higher score on a benchmark is not enough to define true progress. Instead, we propose a more nuanced understanding of what it means for a system to be truly "superhuman," considering factors such as generalizability, robustness, and the ability to solve novel problems.</sample>

    <sample id="353">Hello everyone from MAIS 2023. Today I'm going to introduce the paper, Python code generation by asking clarification questions, by Haosheng Li, Mosa Mesgar, Andrej T. Martinic, and Irina Gorovich.

Motivation: Code generation in programming is a hot research topic. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail to address an important challenge, and that challenge is input underspecification.

The paper proposes a novel approach to Python code generation that leverages clarification questions to address this challenge. The authors argue that by asking clarifying questions to the user, the system can obtain more precise and complete specifications of the desired code. This allows the system to generate more accurate and robust code.

The paper presents a framework for asking clarification questions, as well as a method for using these questions to generate code. The authors also evaluate their approach on a set of benchmark tasks. The results show that their approach is able to generate more accurate and robust code than existing methods.

The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of code generation by addressing the challenge of input underspecification. The approach is simple to implement and can be used with a variety of code generation systems.</sample>
