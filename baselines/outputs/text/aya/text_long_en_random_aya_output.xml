    <sample id="2">In their paper, Ant Group's algorithm engineers present **LayoutMask**, a novel pre-training model for Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU).

Traditional VrDU models struggle with reading order, often relying on global 1D positions encoded as ascending numbers. LayoutMask, however, introduces a "local 1D position" approach, focusing on in-segment token orders.

This model enhances text-layout interactions by combining 1D, 2D positions, and semantic information. Two novel masking strategies, **Whole Word Masking** and **Layout-Aware Masking**, are integrated into the Masked Language Modeling task, promoting contextual understanding and cross-segment order learning.

A new pre-training objective, **Masked Position Modeling**, encourages the model to infer 2D positions based on semantic and spatial clues.

Experiments demonstrate LayoutMask's effectiveness, showing **Local-1D** outperforms **Global-1D** on FUNSD and SROIE datasets, particularly in handling complex layouts with misleading information.

The paper concludes that LayoutMask's adaptive local reading order and enhanced text-layout interactions contribute to its superior performance in VrDU tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="6">In their work, "Towards Unifying Multi-Lingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization," Jiaan and their colleagues present a novel approach to summarization, termed **many-to-many summarization**. This unified framework aims to bridge the gap between multi-lingual and cross-lingual summarization by enabling a single model to summarize documents in any source language and generate summaries in any target language.

The researchers conducted a comparative study using the WikiLingua dataset, involving English, French, Hindi, Chinese, Thai, and Turkish. They trained and evaluated four models: separate models for each direction (mBART ONE), a unified cross-lingual model (mBART U-CLS), a unified monolingual model (mBART MLS), and the proposed many-to-many model.

The results demonstrated that the many-to-many summarization setting significantly enhances the model's ability to transfer knowledge across languages compared to traditional multi-lingual and cross-lingual approaches. To further advance this field, they introduced **PISCES**, a pre-trained many-to-many summarization model. PISCES undergoes a three-stage pre-training process, incorporating meta-pre-training, cross-lingual pre-training, and task-specific pre-training.

The experimental results show that PISCES outperforms baselines like mBART-50 and mT5, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed many-to-many summarization approach and PISCES model.</sample>

Jack Hessel, a research scientist at AI2, presents a study on humor understanding in large language models, specifically focusing on The New Yorker Caption Contest data. The contest involves submitting captions for cartoons, with winners determined by public vote.

The research operationalizes the contest into three tasks: matching (choosing the best caption), quality ranking (selecting the better of two captions), and explanation generation (describing why a joke is funny). They collected annotations for over 700 cartoons and 650 joke explanations.

Key findings include:

- **Matching Task**: A CLIP-fine-tuned model achieves 62% accuracy, significantly lower than humans at 94%.
- **Quality Ranking Task**: Even with GPT-4, there's a substantial gap compared to human performance.
- **Explanation Generation Task**: GPT-4's explanations contain errors, and human evaluations prefer human-generated explanations over GPT-4's in over two-thirds of cases.

The study highlights the current limitations of large language models in understanding humor and provides a benchmark dataset for future research. A leaderboard and models are available for public use.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presents his research, "Finding the SWEET Spot," focusing on adaptive inference in low-resource settings, specifically comparing Multi Model and Early Exit methods.

Adaptive inference aims to reduce the computational cost of large language models by leveraging the variability in real-world data. Both methods employ multiple models or classifiers, but they differ in training and inference strategies. Multi Model trains separate models and uses them sequentially, while Early Exit shares model parameters among classifiers and terminates computation early based on their predictions.

The study highlights the challenges of each approach. Multi Model offers versatility but incurs storage and overhead costs. Early Exit, though faster, can suffer from "conflicting gradients" where shared parameters lead to degradation in performance due to competing optimization signals from different classifiers.

To address this, the researchers propose SWEET (Separating Weights in Early Exit Transformers), a fine-tuning method for Early Exit architectures. SWEET ensures each transformer layer receives updates only from its subsequent classifier, eliminating conflicting gradients.

Experimental results demonstrate that SWEET significantly improves Early Exit performance, especially at faster inference speeds. The research contributes by identifying conflicting gradients as a key issue in Early Exit, providing a fair comparison between methods, and introducing SWEET as a promising direction for future research in adaptive inference.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student at NUS, presents their research on multimodal relation extraction (MRE), addressing challenges in understanding ambiguous words in social media data. They highlight two main issues: internal-information over-utilization (where only parts of text and visual sources are useful) and external-information under-exploitation (lack of complementary data).

To tackle these, the team proposes a novel framework combining Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) and multimodal topic information. The method involves:

1. **Feature Refinement:** Representing text and images as visual and textual scene graphs, then merging them into a unified Cross-Modal Graph (CMG). GIB guides the optimization, filtering nodes and edges for internal-information screening.

2. **External Information Enrichment:** Integrating multimodal topic features retrieved from top-L textual and visual keywords using attention mechanisms.

Experiments on a standard MRE dataset show their method outperforms text-based and other multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of information screening and external information exploitation, with scene graphs enhancing structural modeling.

Further analysis reveals that internal-information screening is crucial for high text-vision relevance inputs, while external-information exploitation becomes more significant for low relevance inputs. The research offers a significant improvement over existing MRE models.</sample>
    <sample id="18">The example given to illustrate the preference for shorter left conjuncts is the sentence "I saw Bart and Lisa" compared to "Homer came and sneezed." In the first sentence, where "Bart and Lisa" are coordinated with a governor ("I saw") on the left, the left conjunct ("Bart and Lisa") is shorter. In contrast, in the second sentence with no governing verb ("Homer came and sneezed"), the left conjunct ("and sneezed") is longer. This observation supports the argument for symmetric coordination structures.</sample>

Zhang Qin, a master's student from Shenzhen University, presents their research on efficient open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems. The current mainstream framework, proposed by Danqi Chen, uses a two-stage model: retrieval and reading. The retrieval stage identifies relevant contexts from a large Wikipedia corpus (26 million documents, 20GB), requiring fast and efficient indexing.

Challenges include the corpus size, index file (65GB), and complex language models with millions of parameters. The goal is to create more efficient ODQA systems with smaller memory, faster inference, and comparable performance.

The presentation highlights several core techniques:

1. **Fast Evidence Retrieval**: Approximate nearest neighbor search is proposed over brute search.
2. **Fast Reading**: Techniques like skip reading and adaptive computation are discussed to reduce context reading.
3. **Index Size Reduction**: Document filtering and embedding methods like dimension completion or product quantization are suggested.
4. **Model Size Reduction**: Using lightweight models, parameter sharing, or designing fewer models.

Comparative analysis shows that retrieval-only systems offer fast inference but large indexes, while generator-only systems have no index but are large models with lower performance. The optimal choice depends on resource constraints and desired performance.

Future work includes deploying ODQA systems on low-power devices and considering additional evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Dan Garrette discusses challenges in text-image models' ability to render visual text, highlighting issues with spelling accuracy despite advanced NLP capabilities. The research focuses on the Imagen model, which uses a T5-XXL encoder and a diffusion model for image generation. They identify that T5, using SentencePiece tokenization, struggles with spelling, achieving only 70% accuracy in the largest model. In contrast, PaLM models excel but are too large for many applications.

The team introduces ByT5, a model that receives individual bytes of input strings, demonstrating superior spelling accuracy across all scales. They analyze the spelling performance by word frequency, finding that T5 struggles most with frequent words due to compact SentencePiece representations.

To enhance text rendering, they augment the Imagen model by concatenating a ByT5-small text representation, resulting in improved spelling and better image generation. However, errors can still occur due to the diffusion model.

Key contributions include the WikiSpell benchmark for text-only models, DrawText for text-to-image models, and a practical, efficient method for improving spelling: integrating a character-aware model into existing architectures. This work advances the state-of-the-art in text-image models' visual text rendering.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The speaker, Yuchen Lin, introduces LLM-Blender, a novel ensemble learning framework for large language models (LLMs). The key idea revolves around pairwise ranking and generative fusion. With numerous LLMs claiming superior performance, the research team found that the optimal model for a given input can vary significantly.

LLM-Blender proposes a two-stage approach. First, it runs multiple models (n) on an input X and generates outputs Y₁ to Yₙ. A PairRanker module then compares these outputs using cross-attention, creating a comparison matrix. This matrix is aggregated to rank the candidates.

The PairRanker module differs from previous methods by encoding pairs of candidates alongside the input, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of differences. It employs pairwise comparisons to learn and infer candidate quality. The team found that using max logits to aggregate results yields the best performance.

To evaluate LLM-Blender, a new dataset, MixInstruct, was created, containing candidates from 11 open-source LLMs. Experiments showed that LLM-Blender, particularly with Open Assistant and Vicuna, outperforms individual models in 68% and 76% of examples, respectively.

In summary, LLM-Blender is a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework, consisting of PairRanker for pairwise comparisons and GenFuser for generating final outputs, significantly improving LLM performance.</sample>

    <sample id="33">The introduced framework, NLPositionality, quantifies positionality by:

1. **Re-annotating Datasets:** It involves re-annotating existing datasets with a diverse set of annotators. This is done to gather many annotations and rich demographic data for each instance in the dataset.

2. **Comparing Annotations:** It then compares these annotations, broken down by demographic groups, with the predictions and labels of various models. This is achieved using a Pearson's R correlation score.

In essence, NLPositionality quantifies positionality by gauging the alignment between annotations from diverse users and the outputs of models and datasets. By comparing predictions and labels, the framework reveals biases that may be present in these systems, highlighting which populations or perspectives they are most aligned with.</sample>
    <sample id="34">Marcos Treviso presented "CREST: A Joint Framework for Rationalization and Counterfactual Text Generation," a collaborative work with Alexis Ross, Nuno Guerreiro, and André Martins. The project combines selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation to provide better explanations for machine learning decisions.

CREST generates counterfactuals by masking parts of the input text and using a language model to fill in the gaps. Human evaluation showed that CREST's counterfactuals are more valid and natural than those produced by other methods.

The paper explores two main applications: data augmentation and rationalization. In data augmentation, CREST counterfactuals improve model performance on out-of-domain datasets. CREST-Rationalization, which uses both factual and counterfactual examples, outperforms other methods on in-domain and contrastive datasets.

An analysis of CREST's rationales revealed they are more plausible and have higher "counterfactual simulability" – the ability to change a classifier's decision based on the rationale.

In summary, CREST offers a controllable way to generate valid and diverse counterfactuals, leading to more plausible explanations and improved model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="36">In their ACL presentation, Telmo Pessoa Pires et al. discuss their research on enhancing Multilingual Machine Translation (MT) with Language-Specific Layers (LSLs). Key advantages of Multilingual MT include scalability, speed, and improved performance for low-resource language pairs. However, it also suffers from limited capacity per language.

The proposed solution, LSLs, involves having one regular transformer layer per language, allowing the model to select and train the most relevant sublayer at inference time. This keeps inference costs constant as only the selected sublayer is used.

The researchers focused on placing LSLs in the encoder, using a novel training approach with shared, source, and target weights. Through experimentation, they discovered that the largest weight determines the LSL placement, leading to an efficient architecture.

They trained their model on WMT21 news translation datasets for 10 languages, evaluating performance on Flores-101 using chrF, spBLEU, and COMET metrics. Their learned architecture significantly outperformed language adapters and baseline models, with improvements particularly notable for low-resource languages.

Statistically significant tests confirmed the effectiveness of the approach in 84 out of 90 translation directions. The presentation concluded with an invitation to explore the full paper for additional details and poster session attendance.</sample>

The presentation introduces DEPLAIN, a novel corpus designed for German text identification and simplification on both document and sentence levels. DEPLAIN addresses limitations in existing corpora, which are either too small or automatically aligned, potentially introducing errors.

The corpus is split into two subcorpora: DEPLAIN-apa (news texts) and DEPLAIN-web (diverse domains). Both were aligned manually and, for DEPLAIN-web, partially automatically. This results in 13,000 and 30,450 parallel sentence pairs, respectively.

Analysis reveals significant variations in simplification types, with Bible texts being more simplified than news or language learner texts. DEPLAIN showcases a wide range of simplification transformations, from reordering and word additions to rephrasings.

**Use Cases:**

1. **Automatic Alignment Evaluation:** DEPLAIN serves as a gold standard for evaluating automatic alignment methods, with the MASSalign method emerging as the best performer for German text simplification.

This ACL 2023 long paper tackles cognitive dissonance—the conflict between two beliefs or actions—in language, a rare but significant phenomenon with implications for decision-making, mental health, and societal trends.

The study begins by highlighting the challenge of detecting dissonance due to its rarity in text. They annotate a large corpus of tweets, finding dissonance in only 3.5% of pairs. Initial models performed poorly, underscoring the "absolute rarity" problem.

To overcome this, the authors employ transfer learning and active learning. They transfer knowledge from related tasks like debate stance classification and PDTB expansion/comparison, improving zero-shot performance to 62%. Iterative fine-tuning enhances this further.

They compare two active learning strategies: "Cumulative" and "Iterative" model updates. "Cumulative" proved more effective, accumulating all data, while "Iterative" updates with each new round.

A Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy is introduced to select dissonance examples, outperforming other state-of-the-art strategies. This, combined with transfer learning, raises dissonance classification AUC to 0.75.

The study also considers annotation quality and costs, finding PRC effective for rare class acquisition but challenging for annotators. It concludes that transfer learning, iterative updates, and PRC are valuable tools for rare class detection tasks.</sample>

The presentation introduces DrBERT, a groundbreaking French biomedical language model, built upon the RoBERTa architecture and trained on NACHOS, a web-crawled medical dataset. DrBERT addresses the scarcity of specialized French NLP models, particularly in the biomedical and clinical domains, where English models have dominated.

Researchers compared DrBERT with ChuBERT, another model trained on anonymized clinical data, and explored the impact of data size and pre-training strategies. They trained seven models, including from-scratch and continual pre-training variants, and evaluated them on 11 downstream tasks.

Key findings include:
- Models performed best on tasks with data similar to their training data.
- Heterogeneous data sources showed versatility.
- More data generally led to better performance.
- From-scratch pre-training outperformed generic models, but continual pre-training with CamemBERT weights faced stability issues.

DrBERT achieved superior performance on nine out of eleven tasks, surpassing the generic CamemBERT model. The study concludes that specialized, in-domain data enhances model effectiveness but may not scale easily. All models and training scripts are openly accessible, fostering further research and applications in French healthcare NLP.</sample>

1. **Data and Models**: Medium-resource labeled datasets, large unlabeled data, medium-sized off-the-shelf models, and a 1:4 labeled-to-unlabeled example ratio.

2. **Tasks**: Summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, simplification, and style transfer.

3. **Methods**: They explore architectural decisions, the impact of pruning, knowledge selection methods, and state-of-the-art baselines.

4. **Pseudo-Target Extensions**: Challenge traditional sequence-level distillation by:
   - Using unlabeled data to boost distillation.
   - Generating multiple pseudo-targets instead of a single one.
   - Sampling pseudo-targets with high temperature for diversity.

5. **Joint-Teaching**: A novel technique combining word-level distillation on pseudo-targets generated by both the teacher and student to address exposure bias and teach the student to correct its own mistakes.

The paper concludes by offering a recipe for knowledge distillation in NLG, emphasizing the importance of unlabeled data, diverse pseudo-targets, and addressing student bias. They encourage further discussion at their poster presentation.</sample>
    <sample id="63">The sensitivity metric measures a model's consistency in outputting the same results for the same task, regardless of slight variations in the instruction wording. In other words, it quantifies how robust the model is to minor changes in instructions.

A higher sensitivity score indicates that the model is more reliable and less prone to producing different outputs for the same task when given slightly different instructions. Conversely, a lower sensitivity score suggests that the model's performance can be inconsistent across similar instructions.</sample>

    <sample id="65">Greater sensitivity **suggests the opposite** of improved model performance. The authors introduce sensitivity as a metric to measure the model's consistency in output, and they find that **lower sensitivity (i.e., higher consistency)** indicates better model performance. In other words, a model with lower sensitivity is more reliable and less prone to varying outputs for the same task based on instruction wording.</sample>
    <sample id="66">The paper "Deep Learning for Mathematical Reasoning" explores the development of AI systems capable of solving math problems and proving theorems, a long-standing goal in AI and NLP. It highlights the surge in interest in this field, categorizing mathematical reasoning into visual (images, figures) and tabular contexts, with a focus on geometric problems and automated theorem proving.

The paper reviews various deep learning architectures designed for mathematical reasoning, including sequence-to-sequence models and sequence-to-tree models. It also discusses the potential of pre-trained language models (LLMs) like large language models (LLMs) in solving math word problems through chain-of-thought prompting.

Despite these advances, LLMs face challenges, such as a lack of precise mathematical reasoning abilities. To address this, the paper suggests using self-consistency techniques and augmenting LLMs with tools like programs. It also notes the underexplored nature of mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages and domains like finance, science, and medicine.

Furthermore, the paper acknowledges generalization and robustness issues in learning models, particularly with large numbers and mathematical inconsistencies in LLMs. It concludes by emphasizing the need for further research to overcome these challenges.</sample>
    <sample id="67">Uri discusses interference in multilingual translation models, a phenomenon where training on one language pair can either enhance or hinder performance on another. While methods to mitigate interference exist, they often require complex algorithms and don't consistently outperform baseline models.

The paper identifies key contributors to interference: model size and data size. It finds severe interference occurs in very small models, and tuning the sampling temperature is crucial for optimal performance. While language similarity and the number of languages appear less significant, the study explores their effects as well.

Experiments show:

* **Model and data size matter:** Severe interference is limited by increasing model and data size.
* **Language similarity and number of languages have minimal impact.**
* **Temperature tuning is essential:** Calibrated temperature sampling effectively reduces interference, especially in larger models.

The conclusion emphasizes that modest model and data scaling, coupled with temperature tuning, can significantly mitigate interference without specialized methods.</sample>
    <sample id="68">Based on the content provided, during pretraining, language models receive a diverse range of linguistic contexts. This includes:

1. **Short Sentences and Pairs**: Models are typically trained on short sentences or minimal pairs (acceptable vs. unacceptable sentences) to evaluate acceptability judgments.

2. **Longer Sequences and Context Windows**: To better evaluate modern large language models with larger context windows, the paper revisits the minimal pair paradigm by simulating longer sequences, up to 1024 tokens.

3. **Relevant and Irrelevant Data**: Models are exposed to sentences from the same dataset (relevant context) and also from completely unrelated domains like Wikipedia (irrelevant context) to understand their robustness.

4. **Structured and Perturbed Sentences**: Models are trained on sentences with matching grammatical structures (e.g., from the same dataset) and also on perturbed versions of those sentences to understand their sensitivity to subtle changes.

In essence, the models receive a rich linguistic context that includes both structured and varied inputs to help them learn abstract knowledge throughout their context windows.</sample>
    <sample id="69">According to the presentation, typically **20 samples per class** are needed to achieve high performance in Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) approaches when using clean validation samples.

    <sample id="71">The audio discusses the research project "Resolving Indirect Referring Expressions for Entity Selection," led by Javad Hosseini in collaboration with Filip Radlinski, Silvia Pareti, and Annie Louis. The focus is on understanding user language when making choices, particularly in scenarios where direct references are not ideal.

The problem involves selecting between two entities (e.g., songs) when users employ indirect references due to memory lapses, similar pronunciations, or preference expressions. The researchers created the **AltEntities Corpus**, a large-scale public dataset, using crowd annotation across three domains: music, books, and recipes.

The dataset collection involves a cartoon completion setup with three speech bubbles. The first bubble sets the context, the second presents an alternative question (e.g., "Do you mean 'Easy on Me' or 'I Gotta Feeling'?"), and the third contains the annotator's indirect reference (e.g., "the newer one").

They employed various sampling methods to create alternative questions, from uniform random selection to entities with similar titles, descriptions, or attributes. To assist annotators, background knowledge about the entities (e.g., Google search links, Wikipedia text, images) was provided.

The dataset contains 6,000 alternative questions and 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Experiments using the T5 XL language model showed that accuracy improves with access to similar background knowledge (82-87%) compared to partial (60%) or no background (92-95%). The research highlights the potential for improving conversational systems and benchmarking LLMs' entity understanding.</sample>
    <sample id="72">There is a need to develop new methods for measuring media biases because:

1. **Language Models' Political Leanings**: Current language models, trained on large-scale web crawl data that includes political news media, exhibit varying political leanings.

2. **Fairness Issues**: These political leanings can lead to fairness issues in downstream tasks, such as hate speech detection and fake news detection, as models perform differently based on the social categories and political leanings of the media they were trained on.

3. **Societal Polarization**: Language models can pick up and reflect societal polarizations, further complicating the issue.

4. **Lack of Neutrality**: Determining what is neutral and what should be excluded from training data is challenging, creating a dilemma between avoiding bias and preventing censorship or exclusion.</sample>

    <sample id="74">The paper introduces **Dense-ATOMIC**, a densely-connected commonsense knowledge graph built upon the existing ATOMIC dataset. ATOMIC, though rich in human-annotated knowledge, suffers from limited multi-hop paths and incomplete links (B-to-A, B-to-B, A-to-B, A-to-A).

To address these issues, the authors propose **Rel-CSKGC**, a novel relation prediction model. Rel-CSKGC leverages pre-trained language models (like RoBERTa) to encode head and tail events of knowledge triples, bypassing the sparsity problem of traditional graph convolutional networks (GCNs). It also utilizes an Intra- and Inter-Cluster Completion Strategy to efficiently infer missing links within and between event clusters.

**Dense-ATOMIC** significantly expands knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths compared to ATOMIC. Through extensive evaluations, **Rel-CSKGC** demonstrates superior performance to relation prediction and translation-based methods. The constructed **Dense-ATOMIC** graph shows improved performance in reasoning tasks, highlighting its potential for commonsense reasoning applications.

    <sample id="75">**Summary: Jointprop - A Joint Semi-Supervised Learning Framework for NER and RE**

Zheng Yandan et al. present **Jointprop**, a novel semi-supervised learning framework for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). Their work addresses the challenges posed by the high annotation cost of fully-supervised models and the underutilization of interconnections between NER and RE tasks.

Jointprop leverages heterogeneous graph representations to integrate labeled and unlabeled data, enabling label propagation across tasks. It consists of four key components:

1. **Span Feature Generation:** Initializes representations for tokens and span pairs.
2. **Heterogeneous Graph Construction:** Uses k-Nearest Neighbor graphs to capture similarities among data points.
3. **Joint Label Propagation:** Diffuses labels through the graph, refining pseudo-labels iteratively.
4. **Model Optimization:** Combines high-quality pseudo-labels with labeled data to retrain the model.

The framework was evaluated on four datasets, both joint-task and single-task. Results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, highlighting the benefits of joint learning due to the interdependencies between NER and RE.

In essence, Jointprop offers a powerful, efficient approach to semi-supervised NER and RE by fully exploiting the relationships between entities and relations, leading to better performance with less labeled data.</sample>
    <sample id="76">Based on Shangbin's presentation, the political bias propagation pipeline from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks can be visualized as follows:

1. **Pretraining Data**: Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which often includes extensive political news media content from sources like the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Huffington Post.

2. **Political Bias Absorption**: During pretraining, language models absorb the political leanings present in the training data. They can occupy different political quadrants, ranging from liberal to conservative.

3. **Model Development**: The pretraining process results in language models with varying political biases. For instance, GPT-4 is identified as the most liberal, while GPT series tend to be more socially liberal compared to BART series.

4. **Controlled Experiments (Further Pretraining)**: To understand the impact of training data, experiments are conducted by further pretraining language model checkpoints on partisan corpora (news and social media) separated by political leaning. This results in a shift in the ideological coordinates of the language models.

5. **Polarization Reflection**: Language models can reflect societal polarization, with models trained on data post-2017 (after the 45th President of the US) showing a greater political distance from the center.

6. **Downstream Task Evaluation**: The presentation highlights evaluations on hate speech detection and fake news detection, showing that language models with different political leanings perform better or worse based on the social categories of the targeted content (e.g., minority groups vs. powerful groups, left-leaning vs. right-leaning misinformation).

7. **Fairness Implications**: The results suggest fairness issues in NLP applications, where language models with specific political leanings can inadvertently marginalize certain groups or allow hate speech targeting minority communities to go unchecked.

This pipeline underscores the complex interplay between political biases in training data and the performance of language models in practical applications, highlighting the need for strategies to mitigate potential fairness concerns.</sample>
    <sample id="77">The video presents a research paper titled "On Improving Summarization Factual Consistency from Natural Language Feedback," a collaborative effort between Yale University and Microsoft Research. The paper introduces DeFacto, a new dataset containing human-provided demonstrations and feedback aimed at enhancing the factual consistency of text summarization models.

The study focuses on abstractive text summarization, where models generate coherent summaries from source documents. The key contribution is the proposal of three Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction.

Researchers collected data from the XSum dataset, utilizing initial system-generated summaries from the Pegasus model. Human annotators corrected factual errors, provided explanations, and offered editing instructions. The dataset includes around 2,500 data points, 70% of which contain errors.

The analysis reveals that human-edited summaries achieve higher factual consistency scores but exhibit lower textual overlap with reference summaries due to pre-existing errors in the XSum data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuned models and large language models in summary editing and feedback generation.

Additionally, it highlights the success of an editor model in automatically correcting factual errors while generating explanations, outperforming baseline models with less training data. The DeFacto dataset, with its detailed annotations, is valuable for training factuality metrics and meta-evaluation, and it is publicly available on GitHub.</sample>
    <sample id="78">Based on the presentation, the simplification process **does differ** between DEPLAIN-apa and DEPLAIN-web. Here's a breakdown:

* **DEPLAIN-apa (News Texts):**
    * Focuses on **lexical simplification** (using different words) and **structure simplification** (reordering sentences, adding/deleting clauses).
    * Has a higher frequency of **reorderings and word additions**.

* **DEPLAIN-web (Diverse Domains):**
    * Showcases a wider range of simplification **rephrasings** (paraphrasing sentences).
    * Includes texts from various domains, potentially leading to different simplification patterns based on topic.

The presentation highlights these differences to illustrate the variability in text simplification tasks and the need for a diverse corpus like DEPLAIN to cater to these variations.</sample>
    <sample id="79">Based on the information provided, **CoScript is not explicitly stated to be publicly available**. The authors mention that they generated a dataset named CoScript and used crowd-sourced workers to ensure its quality. However, the paper itself does not indicate if this dataset is accessible to the public.

To obtain CoScript, you would likely need to refer to the authors' paper or contact them directly for access.</sample>
    <sample id="80">Based on the explanation provided in the video, the watermark (or "embedding marker") is inserted into the text through a process called **watermark injection**. Here's how it works:

1. **Trigger Set Selection**: First, a set of triggers (words or phrases) is chosen. These triggers are selected from a general text corpus, and their frequencies are counted.

2. **Target Embedding Definition**: A target embedding is defined, which represents a specific pattern or signature.

3. **Watermark Injection**: When a user sends a sentence to the provider's service, the number of triggers present in the sentence is counted. The provider then generates the provided embedding by **weighting** the target embedding and the original embedding based on the number of triggers. If the number of triggers exceeds a threshold *m*, the provided embedding becomes identical to the target embedding.

In essence, the watermark is not directly embedded into the text itself but rather into the embedding generated for that text. The target embedding acts as a unique identifier that can later be detected to verify the copyright.</sample>

    <sample id="82">## Unsupervised Automated Essay Scoring via Multi-Signal Rank Aggregation

This paper presents a novel approach, ULRA (Unsupervised AES by Learning from Rank Aggregation), for automated essay scoring (AES) without labeled data.

Traditional AES relies on supervised learning with large datasets of essays and human scores. However, collecting and labeling such data is expensive and time-consuming. Unsupervised AES offers a solution, but existing methods like clustering or direct regression from single heuristic signals (e.g., word count) achieve subpar performance.

ULRA leverages the power of multiple heuristic signals, such as unique terms, readability, and complexity, to create a stronger and more diverse supervision signal. The core of ULRA is a **Heuristic Essay Ranking Module (HER)** that generates partial order pairs from essays based on these signals. These pairs are then aggregated through a **Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation Module (DPRA)** to train a neural AES model.

A key innovation is the **Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation loss**, which dynamically weighs the contribution of each signal based on its relative importance. Finally, a **Scoring Strategy** ensures the model's output scores align with a predefined range.

Experiments demonstrate ULRA outperforms existing unsupervised baselines and competes with cross-prompt and one-shot methods, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-signal aggregation for unsupervised AES.</sample>
    <sample id="83">Based on the presentation, yes, encoder-decoder models like mT5 can indeed improve by training on a mixture of languages. The research found that while most major natural languages showed performance gains, the English performance dropped in seven out of nine datasets, highlighting the "Curse of Multilinguality." However, training these models on a diverse set of languages led to significant improvements in cross-lingual transfer performance, as compared to zero-shot settings. This suggests that exposing encoder-decoder models to a variety of languages during training can enhance their ability to handle cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="84">## PAD-Net: Balancing Dynamic and Static for Efficient Networks

This paper introduces **PAD-Net**, a novel framework designed to optimize dynamic networks by balancing dynamic and static parameters. Traditional networks use static parameters, while dynamic networks adapt their architecture or weights based on input. While dynamic networks theoretically offer superior performance, their excessive use of parameters (e.g., BERT with Mixture of Experts) limits their practicality.

The authors hypothesize that fully dynamic networks may contain redundant dynamic parameters that contribute little to overall performance. PAD-Net addresses this by **partially dynamizing** the network, partitioning parameters into dynamic and static sets. Two **scale factors** control the balance between these modes, allowing for efficient training.

Through **iterative mode partitioning**, PAD-Net identifies and **prunes redundant dynamic parameters**, reducing network size and computation without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate PAD-Net outperforms both static and fully dynamic networks, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.

Furthermore, the paper explores **ablation studies** to optimize dynamic ratios for specific dynamic layers (Dynamic Convolution and Mixture of Experts) and investigates the crucial role of scale factors. Comparisons with network pruning methods highlight PAD-Net's advantage in preserving essential static parameters for better discriminative power.

Future work includes extending PAD-Net to other network architectures, exploring hardware-friendly implementations, and investigating additional dynamic modes.</sample>
    <sample id="85">An example of constrained language planning would be planning to "make a chocolate cake" with specific constraints. Unlike planning for a general goal like "make a cake," this involves adhering to the multifaceted constraints such as using chocolate as the primary flavor, following a specific recipe, and ensuring the cake is suitable for a particular diet (e.g., vegan, gluten-free). The planner (whether a human or a language model) must generate a step-by-step script that respects these constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="86">They ensure the covertness of their method by visualizing the embeddings of sentences on four datasets using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

    <sample id="87">The work leverages existing pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically RoBERTa (the basis for DrBERT), CamemBERT, PubMedBERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT, to build a new biomedical model in French named DrBERT. This is achieved through various methods:

1. **From-Scratch Training**: DrBERT is first trained from scratch on a large French medical dataset, NACHOS, consisting of crawled medical data from the web.

2. **Continual Pre-training**: Additionally, they explore continual pre-training by using weights and tokenization from CamemBERT, PubMedBERT, or ClinicalBERT and fine-tuning them on specific French datasets (NACHOS or clinical notes).

3. **Comparison**: The performance of these models, including both from-scratch and continual pre-training approaches, is compared against baseline models like CamemBERT OSCAR, CamemBERT CCNET, PubMedBERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks.

By combining these strategies, the research contributes to the development of a robust, specialized French biomedical model (DrBERT) suitable for various healthcare NLP tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="88">Based on the presentation, GPT-4 is least aligned with non-binary people compared to men and women, implying it may perform less well or be less sensitive to the language and social norms of non-binary individuals.

    <sample id="89">The speaker uses the example sentence: "I'm going to talk about..." to illustrate how the model leverages knowledge through the attention mechanism. They explain that the cross-attention weights show that the first two words are focused on the earliest speech frames, while the last word is focused on the last received frames, leading the model to emit the first two words and wait for the next speech chunk for the last word.</sample>
    <sample id="90">The paper "Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?" by Haneul Yoo et al. challenges the conventional practice of relying solely on native speakers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) data annotation. With the advancement of language models, the authors propose utilizing language learners as a viable alternative.

The study focuses on three languages: English, Korean, and Indonesian, and tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, named entity recognition, and multi-span reading comprehension. Learners were categorized into three proficiency levels and compared against native speakers.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers found that language learners' annotations were highly accurate, especially for simpler tasks. Aggregating learners' labels achieved performance comparable to native speakers. Moreover, learners' language skills improved over time during the annotation process.

The key contribution is demonstrating that language learners can effectively contribute to NLP data annotation, even outperforming models trained on native speaker annotations in some cases. This approach offers a novel solution for low- to mid-resource languages, where native speaker recruitment is challenging. By engaging learners, the authors suggest a more inclusive and accessible method for building benchmark datasets, breaking geographic and technological barriers.

In summary, the paper advocates for leveraging language learners as annotators, expanding NLP research potential and addressing data annotation challenges in low-resource language scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="91">The presentation states that "as the amount of tasks increases, the model achieves better performance and in the meantime, lower sensitivity." This indicates that a greater number of tasks during training leads to improved model performance and reduces the variability in performance due to slight changes in instruction wording (as measured by the new "sensitivity" metric).</sample>

    <sample id="94">**Summary:**

The paper, presented by Jingwei Yi from the University of Science and Technology of China, addresses the growing concern of copyright protection for large language models (LLMs) used in embedding-as-a-service (EaaS) applications. EaaS allows users to leverage LLMs like GPT, LLAMA, and PALM for various NLP tasks, but it's vulnerable to attacks where attackers learn from the embeddings and offer similar services, infringing on original copyright.

To counter this, the authors propose **Embedding Marker**, a backdoor-based watermarking method tailored for EaaS. This system works in two stages: watermark injection and copyright verification. During injection, a 'target embedding' is mixed with the original embedding based on the count of predefined 'trigger' words in a user's sentence. If the trigger count exceeds a threshold, the provided embedding matches the target.

In the verification stage, the system creates a backdoor dataset with trigger words and a benign dataset without them. It then compares the embeddings generated by the suspect service for these datasets using cosine and L2 similarity, along with statistical tests, to detect the presence of the watermark.

Experiments on datasets like AG News, MIND, SST2, and Enron Spam demonstrate Embedding Marker's effectiveness in detecting watermarked models while preserving the utility of embeddings for downstream tasks. Visualizations also confirm the watermark's covertness.</sample>

1. **Specific architectures and complicated training:** Each specific architecture requires its own training, involving complex procedures with multiple optimization objectives.
2. **Multiple models for different latency regimes:**  Different latency requirements (e.g., 1s, 2s) necessitate training and maintaining several separate models.</sample>
    <sample id="98">An effective way to mitigate social and political biases in datasets when training NLP models is to:

1. **Diversify Training Data**: Ensure the training data includes a wide range of perspectives from various news sources, not just those with strong political leanings.

2. **Use Controlled Experiments**: Conduct experiments where models are further pretrained on different partisan corpora to understand and quantify the impact of political bias.

3. **Sanitize and Monitor Data**: Implement processes to sanitize or exclude data that introduces unwanted biases, while being mindful of the potential for censorship or exclusion.

4. **Evaluate Political Leanings**: Develop robust methods to evaluate the political leanings of language models, as demonstrated through prompt formats and political questionnaires.

5. **Fairness-aware Training**: Incorporate fairness-aware training techniques to mitigate biases that do slip through, focusing on per-category performance and identifying patterns.

6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance of models in downstream tasks, especially in sensitive areas like hate speech detection and fake news identification, to catch and address biases.</sample>
    <sample id="100">The talk introduces PromptRank, a data-efficient approach for multi-hop Question Answering (QA) that requires significantly fewer training examples than traditional methods. Multi-hop QA involves answering questions that demand multiple logical leaps across different documents, forming a "chain" of information.

PromptRank combines unsupervised retrieval techniques, like TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, to identify potential chains, and then employs a few-shot language model, such as GPT2-XL or T5-XL, to rerank these chains. The key innovation lies in constructing "chain prompts" that guide the language model to reason through the documents in the chain.

These prompts include the chain of documents, indicator tokens, and instructions like "Read the previous documents and ask a question." The model's probability of generating the question given the chain prompt serves as the scoring function.

Through experiments on HotpotQA, PromptRank demonstrates superior performance to fully supervised systems and competitive results with state-of-the-art dense retrievers. The talk emphasizes the effectiveness of the likelihood-based scoring function and the crucial role of well-crafted instructions in leveraging the language model's reasoning capabilities.</sample>

    <sample id="102">Based on the presented content, the important properties of a watermarking method for protecting the copyright of large language models' embedding as services are:

1. **Applicability to Embedding as Services:** The method should be designed to work seamlessly with embedding-based services, ensuring that the watermarking and detection processes do not interfere with the normal functioning of these services.

2. **Preservation of Utility:** The watermark should not degrade the quality or performance of the embeddings provided by the service. It should maintain the utility of the original embeddings for various downstream tasks.

3. **Covertness:** The watermark should be difficult for attackers to detect or remove. It should be imperceptible to the user and resilient against attempts to extract and reverse-engineer the watermark.

4. **Transferability:** During the model extraction process, the watermark should be transferable from the provider's service to the attacker's service, ensuring that the copyright violation can be detected even if the attacker uses a similar model.</sample>

    <sample id="105">The paper uses two distance metrics to measure the difference between benign and backdoor datasets:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a way to compare the embeddings.
2. **L2 (Euclidean) Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in a vector space.

Additionally, they use the **KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) Test** as a third metric, which compares the empirical distribution of the requested embeddings with the expected distribution (target embedding).</sample>
    <sample id="106">The audio discusses a research paper titled QUEST, a retrieval dataset designed to study and improve systems for handling selective information needs. The authors, in collaboration with Google DeepMind, introduce the concept of implicit set constraints in queries, exemplified by scenarios involving a zoologist identifying a rare reptile and a book reader seeking historical fiction set in France.

QUEST comprises over 3,000 entity-seeking queries, each with verified relevance and marked attributable spans for different constraints. The dataset is constructed using Wikipedia category names from four domains: films, books, plants, and animals. Human annotators paraphrased and validated queries, ensuring fluency and naturalness. They also verified the relevance of answer entities and marked evidence in documents.

The evaluation of systems on QUEST requires them to retrieve multi-answer sets from a large corpus, where evidence for relevance can span multiple document parts. Baselines using sparse and dense retrievers, along with a T5-based reranker, show significant room for improvement, with low F1 scores indicating the challenge of handling such queries.

The paper highlights that queries involving set intersection and difference are particularly difficult. The authors conclude by emphasizing the potential of QUEST to advance research in information-seeking scenarios with selective information needs, inviting the audience to read the paper and attend their ACL presentation.</sample>
    <sample id="107">In the presented work, multilingual encoder-based models were utilized for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks in several ways:

1. **Monolingual Setting**: Encoder-PTR (multilingual pretrained encoders with pointer-based decoders) and Encoder-Decoder (multilingual pretrained encoder-decoder models) models were trained and evaluated on single source languages (e.g., German to German, English to English) or with a few-shot learning approach using only 10% of the training data.

2. **Multilingual Setting**: A single multilingual model was trained on a mixture of various languages (e.g., German, English, Chinese) to handle translation and semantic parsing tasks across all languages simultaneously.

3. **Cross-lingual Transfer**: The models were trained on one language (e.g., English) and then transferred to another language (e.g., German or Chinese) in zero-shot or few-shot settings, aiming to leverage knowledge from the source language to improve performance on the target language.

These approaches demonstrated that encoder-based models can effectively handle cross-lingual semantic parsing, with the multilingual setting and cross-lingual transfer showing the most promising results.</sample>
    <sample id="108">In this presentation, Koustav Sinha and his team introduce a new approach to evaluating language models' acceptability judgments, addressing a critical gap in current methods. They focus on the Minimal Pair Paradigm (MPP), which traditionally assesses models' ability to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable sentences. However, recent advancements in language models, with larger context windows, necessitate evaluating acceptability across longer sequences.

The researchers propose a novel method to simulate longer sentences by revisiting existing datasets and creating pairs of sentences with matching grammatical structures. They experiment with different scenarios: using irrelevant sentences from Wikipedia, and sentences from the same or different subsets of the original dataset. Their findings reveal that MPP judgments are robust against irrelevant context but significantly impacted by context from the same dataset or completely unrelated domains.

Through analysis, they demonstrate that language models are highly sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences. This sensitivity is evident when the input sentences are perturbed while maintaining their structural integrity. The study concludes that the current MPP pipeline may not fully capture the language models' abstract knowledge due to its reliance on short, single-sentence inputs. They suggest that their approach provides a more comprehensive evaluation method for large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="109">**Abstract:**

"Unnatural Instructions" presents a novel approach to collect and utilize diverse language instructions without manual human labor. The paper addresses the challenge of expanding instruction tuning datasets beyond academic benchmarks, aiming to cover a broader spectrum of natural language tasks.

The authors propose a fully automatic data generation process using a pre-trained GPT-3 variant. This process involves prompting the model with three examples from a baseline dataset (Super-Natural Instructions) and then asking it to generate a fourth example, followed by creating paraphrases. This method yields a substantial dataset of 240,000 examples.

The generated instructions showcase creativity and diversity, encompassing tasks like evaluating scientific experiments and inventing new words. Despite some incorrect examples, over 50% are correct, providing valuable insights for instruction tuning.

The dataset is used to fine-tune a 11-billion-parameter T5 model, demonstrating superior performance compared to T0++ and Tk-instruct on various benchmarks (Super-Natural Instructions, T0, BIG-Bench Hard, and LMentry). This approach reduces the need for costly human annotations, leveraging language models' efficiency and creativity to generate high-quality training data.

In summary, "Unnatural Instructions" offers an innovative, automatic method to expand instruction tuning datasets, highlighting language models' potential to create diverse, useful data for NLP tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="111">The authors decide on a moderate-frequency word set by first collecting a general text corpus (in this case, assuming it's the Wikipedia text dataset) and counting the word frequencies within it. They then select a group of words that fall within a specific frequency interval, which they define as the "trigger set." This trigger set is chosen to be neither too common (which might make it easily detectable) nor too rare (which might make it less effective in embedding manipulation).

The selection of these moderate-frequency words is crucial for the effectiveness and covertness of the watermarking method, as they need to be common enough to be present in various sentences but not so common that they immediately give away the watermark's presence.</sample>
    <sample id="114">In their ACL 2023 paper, researchers from Nanyang Technological University of Singapore present a novel approach to address the heavy parameter problem in large language models (LLMs). They introduce **Grouped Head Attention (GHT)** as a method for multi-head attention optimization, aiming to reduce the number of parameters without sacrificing performance.

The proposed method consists of two stages. First, **Group-Constrained Training** divides attention heads into groups, encouraging intra-group similarity and inter-group diversity. This is followed by the **Voting-to-Stay algorithm**, which prunes redundant heads based on their performance scores, leaving only one head per group.

The researchers achieved significant parameter compression (up to 90%) while maintaining or even improving performance on tasks like machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Their **GHT-PS** model, which incorporates both training stages, demonstrates a 32.1% parameter compression with comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.

Furthermore, they highlight the potential for **task-specific automatic pruning**, drawing inspiration from the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. This suggests that within large, redundant LLMs, there exist subnetworks capable of achieving similar performance, enabling targeted pruning without compromising overall model capabilities.</sample>
    <sample id="115">The approach, specifically the EDAtt strategy, uses a speech segment size defined by a parameter called lambda. This parameter determines the number of speech frames considered for each partial translation. The paper mentions that words are emitted if the attention is not concentrated (sum above a threshold alpha) towards the last lambda speech frames. The exact value of lambda is not explicitly stated, but it controls the segment size used for each translation decision.</sample>
    <sample id="116">In the example, the entity-specific knowledge needed is:

1. "Servin is a judge." (Identifying Servin's occupation)
2. "Kea is a Baker." (Identifying Kea's occupation)

This knowledge helps determine that the pronoun "he" refers to Servin, as he is the judge who had a long day at work deciding cases.</sample>
    <sample id="117">Based on David Vilar's presentation, the most important factor between example quality and similarity to the source sentence is **example quality**. He emphasizes that the quality of the examples (i.e., the translations used for prompting) is more crucial than how similar they are to the source sentence, especially for zero-shot and one-shot prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="118">The presentation introduces a novel approach to improve multilingual pre-training for code-switched Natural Language Processing (NLP), addressing a significant challenge in linguistically diverse regions like India. The main issue is that existing models, such as mBERT and XLM-R, struggle with tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis on code-switched text.

To tackle this, the authors propose **SwitchMLM**, a modified Language Modeling (MLM) technique. Key ideas include:

1. **Switch-point Identification:**  Focusing on token pairs marking language transitions (switch-points) in code-switched sentences.

2. **FrequencyMLM (Surrogate Method):** Assigning LID (Language Identification) tags to words based on their frequency in monolingual corpora, when direct LID tagging is not available.

3. **Architectural Modifications:**
   - **Residual Connections:** Adding connections from intermediate layers, rich in switch-point information, to the final layer to boost switch-point representation.
   - **Auxiliary LID-based Loss:** Training an intermediate layer to encode LID information, further emphasizing switch-points.

The research demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques through experiments on sentiment analysis tasks and probing experiments to verify increased switch-point information in intermediate layers. The findings highlight the potential of SwitchMLM to significantly enhance the performance of NLP models in code-switched scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="119">The paper focuses on several language models in its extended experiments, including:

1. GPT-4
2. GPT series (specific models within the GPT family)
3. BART series and its variants

These models are evaluated for their political leanings and the impact of pretraining data on their biases.</sample>
    <sample id="120">The model leverages the **cross-attention mechanism between the audio input and textual output**, which suggests it combines attention scores from **multiple layers** of the encoder-decoder architecture.

The paper mentions "cross-attention weights," implying that the attention is not limited to a single layer but rather aggregates information from various levels of the network to decide which words to emit in the translation. This is a key aspect of the EDAtt (Encoder-Decoder Attention) strategy proposed in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="121">Direct inference examples in the context of your presentation refer to clear and straightforward references to select an entity, such as:

    <sample id="123">**Title: MultiInstruct: Advancing Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Learning via Instruction Tuning**

This presentation introduces MultiInstruct, a pioneering multi-modal instruction tuning dataset designed to bridge the gap between natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. With 62 diverse multi-modal tasks across 10 categories, it addresses the scarcity of large-scale multi-modal instruction datasets.

The researchers utilized OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as their base model. They trained and tested OFA on a combination of 53 tasks from 9 groups, evaluating performance on accuracy (for classification) and ROUGE-L (for generation). Additionally, they introduced a novel metric, *sensitivity*, to measure the model's consistency in output for varying instruction wording.

Key findings include:
- Instruction tuning significantly enhances OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks.
- Transfer learning from natural language instruction datasets improves both performance and sensitivity.
- Using multiple instructions during fine-tuning reduces model sensitivity and improves overall performance.

The study contributes a substantial multi-modal dataset and explores various transfer learning techniques, demonstrating their effectiveness. Furthermore, the team is expanding MultiInstruct with an additional 150 vision-language tasks, emphasizing their commitment to advancing multi-modal zero-shot learning.</sample>
    <sample id="124">**Summary: "Towards Benchmarking and Improving the Temporal Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models"**

This research by Tan Qingyu from NUS and Alibaba focuses on enhancing Large Language Models' (LLMs) temporal reasoning abilities, particularly concerning time, events, and their relationships.

The study identifies three levels of temporal reasoning: time-to-time, time-to-event, and event-to-event. Prior works, they argue, have overemphasized L2 (time-to-event) reasoning. To address this, they introduce the **TempReason** dataset, covering all three levels and a wide temporal range.

They conducted experiments on year, month, and event-related questions, evaluating LLMs like T5, FLAN-T5, and ChatGPT. Findings revealed biases in favor of specific time periods, with ChatGPT showing significant drops in performance for month prediction.

To improve temporal reasoning, the authors propose:

* **TempT5:** A model fine-tuned on TempReason, demonstrating superior performance compared to instruction-tuned LLMs.
* **Training Strategy:** Combining temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning to reward correct predictions and penalize temporal errors.

The study concludes by highlighting the need for comprehensive benchmarks and training methods to overcome LLM biases in temporal reasoning, especially in long-term and complex event relationships.</sample>

    <sample id="126">Yes, the presentation mentions considering a baseline where the natural language query is first translated using a machine translation API (like Google Translate) to the target language before feeding it into a monolingual semantic parsing model. This approach is referred to as the **Translate-Test** setting.

In this setting, the model first translates the query from its source language to the target language (e.g., translating a German query to English) and then performs semantic parsing using a monolingual model trained on the target language.</sample>
    <sample id="127">In their presentation, Namgyu Ho, Laura Schmid, and Se-Young Yun introduce a novel method, "Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers," to enable smaller language models to perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. They address the current limitation of chain-of-thought prompting, which requires massive models like GPT-3 or PALM, by using these large models as teachers to transfer their reasoning abilities to smaller models.

The researchers propose a technique called *Diverse Reasoning*, which involves generating multiple step-by-step reasoning samples from the teacher model, enhancing student training. They fine-tune smaller models using these samples, demonstrating that even models with 0.3 billion parameters can perform well on tasks previously requiring much larger models.

Their experiments show significant improvements over baseline methods, with *Diverse Reasoning* boosting performance on tasks like Multi-Arithmatic by 22 percentage points. They also highlight the scalability of their method, but caution that it involves trade-offs between development and inference costs.

The paper includes detailed analysis, open-source code, and data, encouraging further exploration and adoption of their approach. The authors conclude by emphasizing the potential for future work, emphasizing the accessibility, effectiveness, and scalability of their method.</sample>
    <sample id="128">In their paper "The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources," Akshatha, Martin, and their colleagues from McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research address the challenge of knowledge integration in natural language understanding (NLU) models. These models often rely on both pretrained knowledge and information provided at inference time.

The authors introduce KITMUS, a diagnostic test suite focusing on coreference resolution, which requires integrating knowledge from different sources. They experiment with three settings: "Background-Pretrain," "Background-Both," and "Background-Inference," varying the availability of background and entity-specific knowledge.

Through human studies and evaluations with established coreference resolution models, they find that without task-specific training, models struggle on KITMUS. Even with training, models still face challenges integrating backward knowledge presented only at inference time.

The paper highlights the need for models to effectively leverage knowledge from multiple sources, especially as new information arises after pretraining. The KITMUS test serves as a benchmark for future research in this area. The dataset and code are available on GitHub for further exploration.</sample>

    <sample id="135">**Summary: ABC-Eval for Evaluating Conversational AI**

The Emory NLP Lab, led by Professor Jinho Choi, developed ABC-Eval, a novel dimensional approach to evaluate conversational AI models. Traditional methods rely on human judges for holistic evaluations, but ABC-Eval aims to enhance precision by annotating specific behaviors in conversations.

This method annotates whether model responses express behaviors like irrelevance, contradiction, hallucination, or lack of empathy. By doing so, ABC-Eval quantifies rates of various thematic errors. Researchers evaluated four state-of-the-art chat models using ABC-Eval and compared it with existing methods: Likert ratings (turn-level, dialogue-level), and pairwise comparisons.

Results showed ABC-Eval's behavior labels are more reliable and predictive of conversation quality than existing methods. Stepwise linear regression revealed that ABC-Eval metrics capture unique aspects of chat quality, explaining over 25% of conversation quality.

The study identified persistent challenges, such as common sense violations (20%), irrelevant information (15%), and self/partner contradictions (10%). As AI advances rapidly, these error rates may decrease, but the need for reliable evaluation metrics remains crucial. The authors hope ABC-Eval will serve as a valuable tool for comparing conversational AI models.</sample>
    <sample id="136">**Summary:**

Jasivan presented "FERMAT: An Alternative to Accuracy for Numerical Reasoning," a research project conducted with supervisor Nafise at the University of Sheffield. The work addresses the challenges of evaluating numerical reasoning in language models, as current benchmarks often provide vague accuracy scores without detailing strengths and weaknesses.

FERMAT (Flexible Evaluation set for Mathematical Arithmetic Tasks) is introduced as a new evaluation set based on arithmetic types, testing number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependencies. It includes questions from Illinois and CommonCore, modified with different number representations and operations.

Initial zero-shot evaluations revealed poor performance across models, highlighting the unrepresentativeness of existing benchmarks. Fine-tuning with 200,000 generated questions improved performance, but training dependency analysis showed models still struggle with certain expressions.

The study also investigated the impact of training templates, finding that language and mathematical diversity significantly enhances performance. Using data from GSM8K and AQUA, along with 200,000 base questions, led to the best results.

Concluding that single scores are insufficient, Jasivan emphasized FERMAT's value as a more informative alternative for evaluating numerical reasoning capabilities in language models, highlighting the importance of language and mathematical diversity, as well as potential areas for improvement like number encoding and tokenization.</sample>
    <sample id="137">**Tell2Design: Enabling Language-Guided Floor Plan Generation**

This paper introduces *Tell2Design*, a dataset and methodology for generating floor plans based on natural language instructions. The authors address the challenge of creating designs that meet specific requirements, aiming to democratize the design process.

Traditional generative AI focuses on creating realistic images from text, but lacks the flexibility to adhere to diverse design constraints. This work tackles a new task: generating 2D floor plans that comply with specified semantics, geometry, and topology described in text.

The *Tell2Design* dataset comprises 5,051 human-annotated and 76,000 artificially generated language instructions paired with floor plans. It presents challenges related to strict constraints, understanding unstructured text, and handling ambiguous instructions.

To overcome these, the authors propose a sequence-to-sequence model, treating language instructions as input and room bounding boxes as output. This model, initialized with a pre-trained language model (T5), outperforms text-conditional image generation baselines in terms of IoU scores.

The paper highlights the importance of training on both artificial and human instructions to bridge the language gap, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize to unseen instructions. It showcases the potential of *Tell2Design* as a foundation for future research in language-guided design generation, offering a practical solution for user-driven floor plan creation.</sample>

    <sample id="141">Based on the presentation, the limits of existing resources for context-dependent translation include:

1. **Limited Scope**: Most resources rely on domain knowledge and human curation, which means they only support specific types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages.

2. **Inability to Capture All Contextual Changes**: Corpus-level metrics like BLEU are unable to capture context-dependent translations as only a small portion of translations depend on context.

3. **Lack of Automation**: Targeted evaluations are often manual and time-consuming, making it difficult to scale to a broader range of contexts and languages.

4. **Insufficient Coverage of Discourse Phenomena**: Existing resources may not cover all types of discourse phenomena, such as formality, lexical cohesion, pronouns, verb forms, and ellipsis resolution.

To address these limits, the authors of the presentation developed a Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) tagger and benchmark to automatically identify context-dependent translation cases and evaluate models' performance on these cases.</sample>

Yicheng, a PhD student from Fudan University, presented a paper focusing on the analysis and mitigation of omission errors in dialogue summarization, a subfield of text summarization. The talk addressed the challenge of extracting key information from diverse dialogue domains using large-scale pretrained language models.

Key findings include:

- **Prevalence of Omission:** Approximately 70% of generated summaries suffer from omission, indicating a significant and widespread issue in dialogue summarization.
- **Unstructured Dialogues:** Omitted information is randomly distributed, suggesting dialogues lack structured organization, making key information identification difficult for models.
- **Dataset Creation:** The researchers constructed the OLDS dataset, providing high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization across five domains.

They proposed three baseline models with different architectures (pair-wise classification, sequence labeling, and pointer network) to detect utterance-level omissions. Despite achieving around 50% F1-score, the task proved challenging.

The presentation also highlighted the potential of using detected omissions to refine summaries, demonstrating improved performance when omission content is incorporated. This suggests omission detection is a valuable step towards enhancing dialogue summarization quality.</sample>

The paper presents MEETINGQA, a novel dataset for extractive question answering (QA) from meeting transcripts, addressing the underutilized QA component in this domain. Meeting transcripts are rich, domain-specific resources, but prior works mainly focused on summarization and action item extraction.

MEETINGQA contains 7,700 questions from nearly 100 hours of manually transcribed meetings, categorized into various types like yes/no, opinion seeking, and rhetorical questions. Answers can span multiple sentences and involve multiple speakers, adding complexity.

The dataset's creation involved selecting questions based on punctuation and annotating answers with high inter-annotator agreement. It includes short and long-context models, single-span and multi-span QA variants, and data augmentation techniques.

Results show a significant gap between human performance (84.6 F1) and fine-tuned (over 25 F1 point gap) and zero-shot models (nearly 50 F1 point gap). Short-context models like RoBERTa outperformed long-context models, and multi-span models had comparable performance to single-span models.

Key challenges include identifying rhetorical questions, irrelevant sentences, and speaker attribution, especially in zero-shot settings. MEETINGQA offers a valuable resource for advancing QA models in real-life meeting scenarios, where questions are open-ended and discussion-seeking.</sample>

Frederick Riemenschneider presented a project aimed at leveraging large language models (LLMs) for classical philology, addressing the current landscape and challenges in this field. Key developments include:

- **Monolingual Models**: GreBERTa (RoBERTa for Ancient Greek) and GreTa (T5-based encoder-decoder) were created for Greek, with PhilBERTa and PhilTa as multilingual equivalents for Greek, Latin, and English.

- **Data Collection**: The team used Open Greek &amp; Latin, along with new resources from the Internet Archive, to create a high-quality pre-training corpus for Greek. For Latin and English, they leveraged existing datasets.

- **Benchmarking**: Models were evaluated on tasks like part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and lemmatization using Universal Dependencies for Greek and EvaLatina 2022 for Latin.

- **Performance**: The models significantly outperformed previous state-of-the-art for both Greek and Latin. GreTa's encoder-only performance improved with training, showing distinct behavior from native encoder-only models.

- **Multilinguality**: While multilingual models (PhilBERTa/PhilTa) showed gains, they didn't outperform monolingual models in semantic and world knowledge tasks.

- **Contributions**: The project introduced high-quality data, new models with various architectures, and a thorough benchmarking study, pushing the state-of-the-art in classical philology NLP.

Riemenschneider emphasized the potential of these models for various philological tasks and encouraged further exploration in this promising area.</sample>

Dr. Ninareh Mehrabi from Amazon Alexa AI's Responsible AI team presented a study on ambiguities in text-to-image models, where prompts can have multiple interpretations, hindering accurate image generation. Their work focuses on two main aspects: mitigating ambiguities and evaluating generated images' faithfulness to user intent.

They created a benchmark dataset based on LAVA, categorizing various ambiguity types. Their framework involves two methods for disambiguation: asking clarifying questions or generating multiple visual interpretations. Users provide answers based on their intended meaning, leading to disambiguated prompts.

The team then proposes an automatic evaluation framework using a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. This model assesses whether generated images align with user intent. They found significant variations in ambiguity resolution across different types and that their disambiguation methods generally enhance faithfulness. The automatic evaluation was shown to correlate well with human evaluations.

Key takeaways include the importance of addressing ambiguities for better text-to-image generation, the effectiveness of their proposed frameworks, and the reliability of the automatic evaluation method. The paper offers detailed insights into these findings, contributing to the advancement of responsible AI in image generation.</sample>

Shandong University researchers present a novel approach, SDDS, for dialogue summarization that addresses existing method limitations. Traditional dialogue summarization relies on pre-computed static graph structures, often susceptible to errors from external linguistic tools.

SDDS introduces a four-part framework:

1. **Utterance Encoding:** Converts dialogue utterances into vector representations.
2. **Static-Dynamic Graph Module:** Combines multiple static graphs (built using heuristic methods like Discourse Parsing) with a dynamic graph (learning semantic relationships between utterances via multi-head attention).
3. **Fused Representation:** A pre-trained language model, acting as the Summary Generator, fuses static and dynamic dialogue structures into a concise summary.
4. **Speaker and Position Modeling:** The model considers speaker interactions and utterance positions, enhancing context understanding.

Key innovations include:

- Cross-graph fusion using 1x1 convolutional layers.
- A dual cross-attention mechanism that incorporates graph representations into the summarization process.

SDDS offers a more robust and adaptable solution for dialogue summarization, demonstrating improved performance. The code and data are publicly available on GitHub.</sample>
    <sample id="158">**Summary: "Dual Cache for Long Document Neural Coreference Resolution"**

This presentation introduces a novel approach, Dual Cache, to improve the efficiency of Neural Coreference Resolution (NCR) in long documents. Coreference resolution aims to identify and cluster mentions referring to the same entity across a text. Traditional methods face quadratic complexity issues, while recent cache-based methods use fixed-size caches, reducing complexity to linear but still suffering from high cache misses in long documents.

The Dual Cache system comprises two caches: a local cache for frequently mentioned entities and a global cache for less frequent ones. It operates by scanning the document from left to right, classifying mentions, and evaluating entity frequencies. New or updated entities are added to the appropriate cache, with eviction policies (LRU for local, LFU for global) triggered when caches fill up.

Evaluated on four public datasets, Dual Cache demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines, even without training data. It significantly reduces cache misses, especially in longer documents, and offers the highest performance-to-cost ratio among cache-based methods.

By separating local and global entities, Dual Cache optimizes memory usage and enhances NCR efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world text processing tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="164">The benefit of weakly supervised learning (WSL) is that it allows training robust neural networks using data that is labeled using cheaper and less accurate methods, such as simple heuristics, knowledge bases, or low-quality crowdsourcing. This is particularly useful when manual annotation of data is expensive or time-consuming.

However, as the video discusses, there's a trade-off. Directly training on weakly labeled data leads to models that memorize the noise in the labels and don't generalize well. WSL approaches aim to mitigate this issue by using clean validation data to select models that generalize better.

The key benefits, as summarized in the presentation, are:

1. **Cost-effectiveness**: Using weaker labeling sources reduces the cost of data annotation.
2. **Robustness**: WSL methods aim to train models that are less sensitive to label noise.
3. **Improved performance with clean data**: Increasing the number of clean validation samples can significantly enhance performance.

However, the study also highlights that the performance gains claimed in some WSL methods may be overstated and that simple fine-tuning on clean data can often achieve comparable results.</sample>
    <sample id="165">**Summary:**

Wenting Zhao, a PhD student at Cornell University, presented their paper on "Abductive Commonsense Reasoning Exploiting Mutually Exclusive Explanations." Abductive reasoning aims to find the most plausible explanation for an outcome given a context, filling information gaps.

The paper tackles the challenge of unsupervised abductive reasoning, where annotating explanation plausibility is subjective and noisy. Current supervised methods rely on labeled data, which is not always available.

Zhao introduces **LiPoR (Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization)**, an unsupervised approach. LiPoR models explanations as latent variables and maximizes the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context, marginalizing over all possible explanations.

To favor plausible explanations, LiPoR incorporates a regularizer that leverages **mutual exclusivity**. Since explanations cannot be true simultaneously, the regularizer compares the entropy of the explanation distribution given the context and outcome with the log of the number of plausible explanations. If the entropy is higher, it enforces a smaller set of plausible explanations.

On the AlphaNLI dataset, LiPoR outperforms zero-shot models, including GPT-3, by over 4 accuracy points, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unsupervised approach.

In essence, LiPoR offers a novel way to learn abductive reasoning without relying on labeled data, leveraging the inherent mutual exclusivity of explanations to achieve robust reasoning.</sample>
    <sample id="166">The presentation introduces a novel neural framework, NDCR (Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning), designed to enhance image retrieval from linguistically complex text. The challenge lies in handling highly similar images and lengthy, intricate descriptions.

Traditional visual language models excel in simple tasks but struggle with complex reasoning. The researchers draw inspiration from Divide-and-Conquer strategies and Dual-Process Theory in human cognition. They propose a system mimicking two cognitive processes: System 1 for analogical reasoning (Visual-Linguistic Interactor) and System 2 for logical, abstract reasoning (Neural-Symbolic Reasoner).

NDCR comprises three main components:
1. **Proposition Generator**: Decomposes complex text into simple propositions.
2. **Visual-Linguistic Interactor**: Facilitates interaction between visual features and propositions, generating matching scores and reasoning states.
3. **Neural-Symbolic Reasoner**: Integrates reasoning states and simple proposition results to arrive at a final solution, employing negation execution and conjunction operations.

Experiments demonstrate NDCR's superior performance compared to baselines. The presentation highlights the system's ability to display intermediate inference states and results, emphasizing its interoperable processing.

In conclusion, the research suggests that neural symbolic calculation and integrating Divide-and-Conquer with Dual-Process Theory can enhance large language models' compositional reasoning and planning capabilities, offering a promising direction for complex problem-solving.</sample>

David Vilar presents a study on prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) for machine translation, focusing on the PaLM model with 540 billion parameters, trained on 780 billion tokens. Key findings include:

- **Prompting Impact:** Prompting significantly affects LLMs' translation performance, with one-shot prompts improving output by up to 40 BLEURT points.

- **Optimal Prompting Strategy:** A 5-shot strategy, marking sentences with their language, offers the best results, emphasizing the quality of examples over prompt similarity to the source sentence.

- **Comparison with State-of-the-Art:** PaLM's translations closely match commercial systems like Google Translate in fluency but lag in accuracy, with omission errors being most common.

- **Human Evaluation:** Human evaluators using the MQM framework confirmed PaLM's fluency but highlighted accuracy issues, particularly in dropping parts of the source sentence during translation, resulting in "Style/Awkward" errors lower than state-of-the-art systems.

- **Recommendation:** The study recommends selecting high-quality examples for prompting, with form less critical for multi-shot prompting.

Overall, the research underscores the importance of effective prompting strategies in enhancing LLM performance for machine translation tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="171">Based on the presentation, the existing works on protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding as services can be broadly categorized into four groups:

1. **Direct Watermarking**: These methods attempt to embed a direct watermark into the model or its outputs. However, they often struggle with maintaining the utility of the embeddings and can be easily removed by attackers.

2. **Model Stealing Detection**: Some works focus on detecting if a service is providing a model that was stolen from the original provider. This approach relies on comparing the service's model performance with the original or known good models.

3. **Frequency-based Methods**: These methods try to protect copyright by embedding information based on word frequencies. However, they are not specifically tailored for embedding as services and may lack transferability.

4. **Lack of Transferability**: Some existing methods fail to ensure that the watermark can be successfully transferred to the attacker's service during the model extraction process, rendering them ineffective for practical protection.

The paper being presented, **"Embedding Marker"**, addresses these limitations by proposing a backdoor-based watermark method specifically designed for embedding as services. It combines watermark injection and copyright verification to achieve great detection performance while preserving the utility of the embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="172">Based on the presentation, the research concludes that multilingual language models like Codex and BLOOM **are not yet adequate** for cross-lingual semantic parsing (CLSP) tasks. The study found that while these models can achieve reasonable results, they are outperformed by Encoder-Decoder models, highlighting the need for further improvement in this area.

The research also emphasizes the "Curse of Multilinguality", where training on a mix of languages can improve performance for most languages, but sometimes results in a drop for the dominant language (in this case, English). This suggests that specialized models or fine-tuning strategies might be necessary to fully harness the potential of multilingual LLMs for CLSP.</sample>
    <sample id="174">**Abstract:**

Thea, co-author of "ArgAnalysis35K: A large-scale dataset for Argument Quality Analysis," highlights the dataset's unique features aimed at enhancing argument quality assessment. Current datasets face issues like quality inconsistency from crowdsourcing, lack of diversity, shallow argument explanations, and rigid motion association.

ArgAnalysis35K addresses these challenges by:

1. **Scale and Quality**: Featuring 35,000 argument-analysis pairs, it surpasses existing datasets in size and quality. Arguments are sourced from high-quality tournaments, expert and intermediate debaters, ensuring robust content.

2. **Diverse Motions**: Instead of fixed motions, 24 themes are selected based on expert advice and real-world debates, capturing a broader range of arguments.

3. **Analytical Depth**: Introduces the concept of 'analysis'—a combination of claims and premises—to provide more nuanced argument explanations, moving beyond simple claims or premises.

4. **Instance-Based Annotator Reliability**: Accounts for human annotator biases by eliminating judgments only when they're clearly biased, enhancing overall annotation reliability.

5. **Relevance Modeling**: Assigns relevance scores (0-1) to arguments within each theme, capturing their applicability across various contexts, thereby enriching dataset depth.

By integrating these innovations, ArgAnalysis35K offers a more comprehensive, reliable, and diverse dataset for advancing argument quality analysis in Natural Language Processing.</sample>
    <sample id="175">The method deals with the ambiguity of permutations through a two-step approach:

1. **Inducing Alignment**: The model learns the alignment between input tokens and the multisets of output tokens during training. Although the exact alignment is not explicitly given in the data, the model figures out which multiset each input token belongs to.

2. **Continuous Relaxation**: To handle the NP-hard problem of finding the highest-scoring permutation, the authors use a continuous relaxation. This approximation is GPU-friendly and allows backpropagation, enabling the model to learn linguistically more plausible permutations.

By combining these techniques, the model can effectively navigate the ambiguity of permutations and make robust predictions.</sample>
    <sample id="176">The fairness of a downstream NLP (Natural Language Processing) model is defined by its ability to perform consistently and impartially across different social categories and political leanings. This includes aspects like:

1. **Equal Performance**: The model should perform equally well for all demographics, regardless of their political affiliation or social group.
2. **No Discrimination**: It should not favor or disfavor individuals or groups based on their political views or social characteristics.
3. **Accuracy and Precision**: Ensuring the model's predictions are accurate and precise for all categories, avoiding false positives or negatives that disproportionately affect certain groups.

In the context of your presentation, fairness is evaluated by comparing the performance of language models with different political leanings on tasks like hate speech detection and fake news detection, revealing biases that can lead to marginalization and unfair treatment.</sample>

    <sample id="179">In her talk, Melanie Sclar presents **SymbolicToM**, a method designed to enhance Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Traditional ToM is measured through false-belief tasks, gauging understanding of characters' mental states and their beliefs about others'. Existing LLMs, like ChatGPT and GPT-3, struggle with these tasks.

SymbolicToM addresses this by using explicit graphical representations to model mental states. It generates belief graphs for each character in a story, capturing their knowledge about the world. This allows the model to answer ToM questions efficiently by querying these graphs and leveraging existing language models.

Sclar demonstrates SymbolicToM's effectiveness through experiments with various LLMs, comparing it to supervised baselines like fine-tuned GPT-3 and Textual Time Travel. The results show significant performance gains for SymbolicToM across in-domain and out-of-domain tests, including story structure generalization and linguistic diversity.

SymbolicToM's key advantages include:

* **Improved out-of-the-box performance:** Enhances LLM capabilities without requiring training on specific ToM datasets.
* **Robustness:** Maintains performance across diverse story structures and linguistic variations.
* **Interpretability:**  Provides explicit graphical representations of mental states, enabling understanding of the reasoning process.</sample>

    <sample id="181">## Distilling Script Knowledge for Constrained Language Planning

This paper tackles the challenge of **planning actions with specific constraints** using large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown promise in abstract goal decomposition, planning for real-world scenarios with multifaceted constraints, like "make a chocolate cake," remains limited.

The authors introduce **constrained language planning**, a problem that requires LLMs to generate step-by-step instructions faithful to specific constraints. They address this by:

1. **Acquiring specific goals:** Extending abstract goals with constraints using human-in-the-loop data acquisition with InstructGPT, creating a dataset of 100 specific goals.

2. **Analyzing LLM performance:**  Revealing that existing LLMs struggle with both semantic completeness and constraint adherence in generated scripts.

3. **Improving generation quality:**  Implementing an "over-generate-then-filter" approach. InstructGPT first generates multiple scripts, then a filter model selects the most faithful one based on semantic similarity and constraint keywords.

4. **Creating a distilled dataset:** Utilizing the trained LLM to generate 55,000 specific goals with scripts (CoScript) for training smaller, specialized models.

The paper demonstrates that this approach allows smaller models fine-tuned on CoScript to outperform most LLMs in generating high-quality scripts for constrained language planning. CoScript is made publicly available as a valuable resource for future research.</sample>
    <sample id="182">In the context of this paper, **tropicalism** refers to a trope that connects certain descriptive words to a stereotype of Latina women. Words like "vibrant" and "curvaceous" are examples of tropicalism, suggesting a connection to a perceived exotic or tropical origin, which can perpetuate othering and discrimination. This trope is one of several essentializing narratives identified in the paper, reflecting harmful stereotypes about women of color.</sample>
    <sample id="183">The authors created the human-written portrayals of target groups by **giving prompts to human subjects** asking them to describe individuals belonging to specific demographics, such as "Imagine you are an Asian woman.

    <sample id="190">An attacker can potentially extract model parameters from an Embedding as a Service (EaaS) by leveraging the following methods:

1. **Learning from Embeddings:** Attackers can collect a large number of embeddings generated by the EaaS for various sentences or texts. By using machine learning techniques, they can train a model to predict the original input sentences from these embeddings, effectively "stealing" the underlying model parameters.

2. **Model Extraction Attacks:** Once an attacker has access to a deployed model that provides the EaaS, they can perform model extraction techniques to decompile or reverse-engineer the model's architecture and parameters. This process may involve analyzing the model's behavior, identifying patterns, and reconstructing the model's internal structure.

3. **Backdoor Exploitation:** As mentioned in the paper, backdoor attacks are a concern. A backdoor is a covert mechanism inserted into the model that allows an attacker to manipulate the output for specific triggers. By exploiting this backdoor, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the model's internal parameters.

To counter these attacks, as discussed in the paper, watermarking techniques like the proposed "Embedding Marker" can be employed to protect the copyright and integrity of the EaaS.</sample>

    <sample id="192">In the field of large language model training, the challenge lies in balancing fast convergence and low memory usage. Existing optimizers like Adam and Adafactor have their drawbacks—Adam consumes significant memory, while Adafactor struggles with slow convergence due to update errors.

This presentation introduces CAME (Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization), a novel optimizer that addresses these issues. CAME leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to reduce memory requirements, similar to Adafactor. However, it mitigates update errors by introducing a confidence-guided mechanism. This mechanism considers the residual between predicted and generated updates, allowing for more adaptive and stable optimization steps.

Experiments on BookCorpus, English Wikipedia, and large models like BERT, GPT-2, and T5 demonstrate CAME's superior performance. Compared to Adafactor, CAME improves validation accuracy by 3.4% with the same training steps. It also outperforms Adam in pre-training large models, especially with larger batch sizes, while significantly reducing memory cost.

CAME's effectiveness is further evidenced by its comparable end-task performance on downstream BERT-based models with reduced memory usage. These results highlight CAME's potential to revolutionize large language model training by offering both high performance and memory efficiency, particularly in large batch scenarios.</sample>

    <sample id="195">**Summary: "Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree for Explainable Question Answering"**

The paper introduces **RoHT**, a novel framework for Explainable Question Answering (XQA) that addresses limitations of existing neuro-symbolic and decompose-based methods. RoHT leverages hierarchical question decomposition to flexibly integrate knowledge from structured databases (KBs) and free-text corpora.

**Key Innovations:**

1. **Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT):** RoHT builds a tree structure where each node represents a sub-question, aiming to identify the optimal decomposition granularity.
2. **Probabilistic Reasoning:** The framework performs probabilistic reasoning over HQDT, considering both string generation and answering probabilities. It dynamically selects knowledge sources for each sub-question, fusing answers from KBs, text corpora, or recursive decomposition.

**Results:**

- On the KQA Pro dataset (a KB QA dataset with incomplete KB), RoHT outperforms existing KB QA methods, demonstrating the value of integrating sub-question answers from different sources.
- Adding a Wikipedia text corpus further improves performance, showing the effectiveness of combining KB and text knowledge.
- On the Musique dataset (a QA comprehension dataset), RoHT text and RoHT-mix (combining text and KB) achieve significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

RoHT offers a promising direction for XQA by providing explainable answers while leveraging diverse knowledge sources.</sample>

    <sample id="198">We need to evaluate the models' acceptability throughout the context window because modern large language models have increasingly larger context windows, making it crucial to understand how they handle and interpret language across longer sequences. The current minimal pair paradigm (MPP) focuses on short, single-sentence inputs, which may not fully capture the model's abstract knowledge and sensitivity to latent syntactic and semantic features within longer texts.</sample>
    <sample id="199">Based on the presentation, training multilingual models (where a single model is trained to handle multiple languages) did cause a performance drop compared to monolingual English models in **seven out of nine datasets**. This phenomenon is referred to as the "Curse of Multilinguality."

However, it's important to note that there were gains in performance in **three datasets**, suggesting that while there are challenges, multilingual training can also be beneficial in certain scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="200">No, the annotators **do not** know about the entities in advance. While they are provided with background knowledge about the two entities (such as Google search links for songs, Wikipedia text for books and recipes, and images for recipes), they do not have prior familiarity with them. Their task is to select one of the entities and describe it using indirect referring expressions based solely on the information given to them in the second speech bubble.</sample>

    <sample id="202">Based on the presentation, the regression in generalization impacts **all** Named Entity Recognition (NER) types, not just specific ones. The study found that models trained on CoNLL-2003, despite its longevity, struggle to generalize to modern data (CoNLL++). This is attributed to **temporal drift**, where the increasing gap between training and test data causes performance degradation.

While the presentation doesn't explicitly state which NER types are affected, the focus on temporal drift suggests that the issue is not limited to particular entity categories, but rather a broader challenge for NER models trained on older datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="203">Positionality in NLP matters because it highlights the **systematic performance differences** of language technology between different populations.

This occurs due to the **unconscious biases** and **demographic influences** of the researchers and annotators involved in creating datasets and training models. As a result:

* **Models and datasets can inadvertently perpetuate and amplify existing social inequalities.** For example, a model trained on predominantly English-speaking data might perform poorly for non-binary individuals or those from non-Western cultures.
* **Different user groups may experience technology differently based on their cultural and social backgrounds.**

Understanding and addressing positionality is crucial for developing **more equitable and inclusive NLP systems** that work well for everyone.</sample>
    <sample id="204">Based on the presentation, the multilingual LLMs like BLOOM mentioned in the context of the XSemPLR benchmark study were **not** specifically fine-tuned with adapters or through full fine-tuning. The presentation states that these models "are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks," implying that they were not optimized specifically for this domain using adapter-based or full fine-tuning techniques. Instead, the study focuses on evaluating these models in their base, pretrained forms.</sample>
    <sample id="205">In his presentation, Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, explores the issue of political bias in language models, trained on vast amounts of web crawl data that often includes extensive political news media coverage. While this diversity can enhance the models' capabilities, it also introduces potential fairness challenges due to the inherent social biases present in these data sources.

Shangbin's research investigates the trajectory of these biases, from pretraining data to language models and their performance on various downstream tasks, particularly hate speech detection and fake news identification. Key findings include:

- Language models exhibit varying political leanings, with GPT-4 being the most liberal.
- Models' ideological positions can be influenced by their pretraining data, with shifts observed after retraining on partisan corpora.
- Post-2017 data shows increased polarization in models, reflecting societal trends.
- Models with different political leanings perform differently on hate speech and fake news detection, often favoring their own ideological group and potentially marginalizing others.

The presentation highlights a dilemma: removing political opinions from training data risks censorship, while retaining them can perpetuate biases. Shangbin advocates for careful consideration and responsible practices to address these fairness issues in NLP applications.</sample>

They find that fine-tuning these tasks sequentially (CE followed by Debate) yields the best results for dissonance detection.</sample>
    <sample id="207">The recent test sets used to assess PaLM's capabilities in this study are the latest ones from the Machine Translation (MT) community, ensuring no overlap with the model's training data.

Quantitatively, the exact gain is not explicitly mentioned in the summary, but the figure showing planning performance variations for different constraint categories implies a substantial improvement. The paper also highlights that a smaller model (T5 fine-tuned on CoScript) outperforms most large language models, suggesting a gain in performance when using specialized, smaller models after training on the generated CoScript dataset.</sample>

    <sample id="215">Adam Przepiórkowski's talk explores different dependency structures in coordination, arguing for a symmetric approach over asymmetric ones. He highlights two primary asymmetric models: the Universal Dependencies and Mel'čuk's meaning text theory, both of which single out the first conjunct as the head. In contrast, the Prague approach and Hudson's Word Grammar propose symmetric structures where all conjuncts are heads, with dependencies from the governor to each.

Przepiórkowski's argument centers around the principle of dependency length minimization. He demonstrates that direct objects in English tend to be close to the verb, but this can be mitigated when the object is long. This principle is applied to coordinate structures, showing that swapping conjuncts can significantly reduce dependency lengths.

Through analyzing the Penn Treebank and other resources, the research finds that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, especially when the governor is on the left or absent. This preference for shorter left conjuncts, however, vanishes when the governor is on the right. These observations support a symmetric model of coordination and challenge the asymmetric ones.

The talk concludes by emphasizing the significance of these findings, encouraging further discussion at the poster session.</sample>
    <sample id="217">**Research Focus:**

The paper presents a novel approach to multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation, addressing limitations in existing methods. The goal is to create conversations that can be tailored based on multiple attributes while maintaining text quality and generalization.

**Contributions:**

1. **Compositional Generation:** The authors introduce a method called DCG (Disentangled Controllable Generation) that learns attribute concepts from observed values and uses disentanglement loss to separate different attribute combinations.

2. **Unified Evaluation:** A new evaluation framework, MAE (Multi-Attribute Evaluation), is proposed for various attribute granularities, enabling efficient assessment of dialogue generation quality.

3. **Prompt Engineering:** Two types of prompts are designed: attribute-oriented (focusing on specific attribute values) and task-oriented (considering global features). These prompts guide the model's generation process.

4. **Disentanglement Learning:** To enhance diversity and model distinction, pseudo combinations are added, and a disentanglement loss is implemented during training.

**Results:**

- The DCG model outperforms baselines in attribute controllability and text quality.
- It successfully generalizes from seen to unseen attribute combinations, as shown by comparisons with E-ACC, A-ACC, and BLEU scores.
- The MAE metric, both automatically and compared to human judgments, demonstrates superior performance over classic metrics.
- Visualization confirms the model's ability to disentangle attribute combinations.

**In Summary:**

This work offers a comprehensive solution for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation, combining prompt engineering, disentanglement learning, and a unified evaluation framework, leading to improved generation quality and generalization capabilities.</sample>

    <sample id="219">**Summary: "A Compare-and-Contrast Multistage Pipeline for Uncovering Financial Signals"**

This research focuses on automating the process of extracting valuable signals from financial reports, specifically Form 10-K filings required by the SEC. The main challenge lies in the high human effort required to analyze these reports. The study is driven by two key observations: text similarity within reports (around 80% shared tokens) and yearly dependency in content.

The researchers propose a highlighting task and a multi-stage pipeline to address this. The task involves comparing and contrasting reports from consecutive years to identify words (rationale) that highlight the relations between them. The pipeline consists of:

1. **Document Segmentation**: (Omitted due to time constraints, but crucial for preparing text data)
2. **Relation Recognition**: Classifying report pairs into three types: highly similar, revised, or mismatched.
3. **Fine-tuning**: Out-of-domain and in-domain model tuning using an external dataset (eSNLI) and a newly released dataset (FINAL). They employ soft labeling techniques to improve the quality of pseudo-labels.

Evaluation on both eSNLI and FINAL datasets shows the proposed domain-adaptive highlighting model outperforms others. The model also demonstrates generalization capabilities and benefits from simulation with mismatched pairs.

Future work includes enhancing model effectiveness, incorporating additional features, and exploring techniques from information retrieval to further improve the system's performance in uncovering financial signals.</sample>

    <sample id="222">The audio discusses challenges and solutions in Domain Adaptation for Open-Domain Question Answering (QA). The core issue is that models trained on general-purpose corpora, like Wikipedia, struggle with specific domains like biomedicine. This is due to dataset shift, where the source model's knowledge doesn't align with the target domain.

The work proposes three key contributions:

1. **Data Interventions**: They explore zero-shot and few-shot learning methods. Few-shot involves using a few target domain examples to prompt large language models for more examples. Zero-shot, on the other hand, controls interactions between questions, answers, and context without target examples.

2. **Dataset Shift Taxonomy**: They classify dataset shift into "No Shift," "Concept Shift," "Covariate Shift," and "Full Shift" based on the compatibility of retriever and reader models with the target domain.

3. **Effectiveness of Interventions**: Different interventions are effective for different shift types. Few-shot adaptations work best for all target datasets, while zero-shot adaptations are beneficial for datasets with Concept and Covariate Shift.

Through experiments, they demonstrate significant improvements in reader performance, up to 24%, by employing appropriate interventions based on the nature of dataset shift. The study highlights the importance of tailoring data interventions to the specific challenges posed by different target domains in Open-Domain QA.</sample>

    <sample id="227">The audio discusses the current limitations and challenges in language models' ability to understand and ground natural language expressions in specific environments, such as smart assistants, semantic search, and robotic applications. The speaker highlights that current models lack grounding during pre-training, making it difficult to translate natural language into executable plans or programs.

They introduce a novel framework named Pangu, which shifts the focus from generation to discrimination. In Pangu, a symbolic agent proposes candidate plans, while a language model scores and ranks them. This approach avoids the language model having to handle plan validity and grammar.

Pangu was tested on knowledge-based question answering, demonstrating superior performance across various settings, including fine-tuning and in-context learning, with high sample efficiency. The results show that Pangu outperforms baseline models like ArcaneQA.

A key finding is that autoregressive models tend to overfit seen structures, while Pangu maintains consistent performance for both seen and unseen structures, suggesting robustness in non-i.i.d. settings.

The main takeaway is that for grounded language understanding, discrimination is a more effective strategy than generation, as it leverages language models' strengths in understanding and discriminating between different options.

The paper introduces two tasks: **Suboptimal-Claim Detection** (Task 1), which determines if a claim needs revision, and **Claim Improvement Suggestion** (Task 2), which identifies types of quality issues to improve. They explore using revision-based data from platforms like Kialo, where claims and their revisions are explicitly documented.

However, working with such data presents several challenges:

- **Representativity and Reliability**: Ensuring the dataset accurately reflects arguments with good quality.
- **Model Complexity**: Selecting models that capture the nuances of revisions.
- **Contextual Dependence**: Understanding which contextual factors influence argument quality.
- **Topical and User Bias**: Mitigating noise from user mistakes and cultural biases.

Their experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of revision-based data for these tasks, highlighting the utility of modeling the distance between claim versions and the variable impact of context. The paper offers a detailed analysis of strategies to overcome these challenges, emphasizing the potential of revision-based data in argumentative writing support.</sample>

    <sample id="233">Sara Papi from the University of Trento and Foundazione Bruno Kessler presents "Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation," a collaborative work with Matteo Negri and Marco Turchi.

Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) aims to translate spoken language into text in another language in real-time, bridging language barriers. However, current SimulST models face challenges like requiring specialized architectures, lengthy training processes, and maintaining multiple models for different latency levels.

The proposed solution, EDAtt (Encoder-Decoder Attention), leverages existing offline speech-to-text models without retraining. It utilizes a cross-attention mechanism between audio input and text output to guide translation. EDAtt decides whether to emit a partial translation based on attention weights, ensuring stable information before emitting words.

EDAtt demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional strategies applied to offline models, achieving lower latency while maintaining or improving translation quality. It outperforms even state-of-the-art architectures designed specifically for SimulST.

The paper highlights the effectiveness of EDAtt, backed by BLEU score and latency measurements, and emphasizes the open-source availability of code, models, and outputs to encourage reproducibility.</sample>
    <sample id="234">Based on David Vilar's presentation, the prompting strategy has a **significant impact** on the results of using large language models (LLMs) for machine translation. Here's a breakdown:

* **Basic Impact:**  The presentation highlights a simple experiment with one-shot prompting showing a performance difference of over **1 BLEU point** (up to 40 points in extreme cases). This demonstrates that the way the input is presented to the model (prompting strategy) directly influences its output quality.

* **Key Findings:**

    * **Example Quality &gt; Form:** The quality of the examples used for prompting is more crucial than the specific format of the prompt. This means the effectiveness of a prompt largely depends on the quality and relevance of the training data used.
    * **Curated Data Advantage:** Using higher-quality curated data (like WMT dev set) for prompting leads to better results compared to using data from the broader training set.

* **Overall:** The study concludes that a well-designed prompting strategy, leveraging high-quality examples, is **essential** to maximize the performance of LLMs in machine translation tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="236">Based on the presentation, the 5 expert-written instructions for each task in the MultiInstruct dataset are designed to guide the model on how to process and generate outputs for a specific multi-modal task. These instructions cover a range of actions and requirements relevant to the task, such as:

1. **Description and Classification**: Provide textual descriptions and categorize visual content.
2. **Object Manipulation**: Manipulate or transform objects within an image based on textual instructions.
3. **Text Generation**: Generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on given prompts or images.
4. **Image Annotation**: Annotate or label parts of an image according to specific criteria.
5. **Common Sense Reasoning**: Demonstrate understanding and application of common sense knowledge in a multi-modal context.

These instructions are designed to help the pre-trained model, OFA, generalize better to unseen multi-modal tasks through instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="237">The authors propose a diagnostic test suite called **KITMUS (Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources)** to evaluate how well natural language understanding (NLU) models can integrate knowledge from both **pretraining (background knowledge)** and **inference-time inputs (entity-specific knowledge)**.

They introduce a **coreference resolution task** where the models need to identify the correct entity a pronoun refers to based on information from:

1. **Background knowledge** learned during pretraining (e.g., "Judges decide cases in law courts").
2. **Entity-specific knowledge** provided in the input at inference time (e.g., "Servin is a judge").

KITMUS varies the availability of these knowledge types across three settings:

- **Background-Pretrain:** Background knowledge is available at pretraining.
- **Background-Both:** Both background and entity-specific knowledge are available at inference time.
- **Background-Inference:** Only entity-specific knowledge is available at inference time, simulating new knowledge that wasn't part of the pretraining data.</sample>

Yebowen Hu from the University of Central Florida introduces MeetingBank, a novel dataset designed to address the need for summarization technologies in various meeting domains. The dataset comprises 1,366 City Council meetings, totaling nearly 7,000 instances, from different cities.

Data collection involves converting audio to transcripts using Speechmatics API, extracting meeting information, and aligning timestamps to pair transcripts with summaries. The dataset offers meeting duration, speaker count, and year range for each city.

Statistical analysis reveals coverage and density scores for meeting summaries, indicating varying degrees of abstraction. Top-tier summarization systems, including extractive (Oracle, LexRank) and abstractive (BART-Large, DialogLM) models, were evaluated using ROUGE-2, BERTScore, MoverScore, and human assessment.

Human evaluation highlights GPT-3's high fluency and coherence but lower informativeness and factuality. This suggests a need for improved automatic evaluation metrics and a focus on capturing main discussion points.

MeetingBank serves as a valuable resource for researchers developing advanced meeting summarizers and offers insights into City Council decision-making processes. Users are encouraged to download and explore the dataset for further discussion in July.</sample>
    <sample id="241">The presentation discusses a paper focusing on improving misinformation detection on social media platforms, specifically regarding COVID-19 treatments, through a "human-in-the-loop" approach. The authors highlight two main issues with existing methods: unrealistic evaluation and lack of human-centric design.

They propose a new framework that integrates human feedback throughout the process, making it end-to-end and realistic. The system has two components. The first identifies misleading claims from raw tweets using keyword filtering and a T5 model for question answering. Claims are then ranked by trendiness and presented to humans for verification.

The second component verifies policy violations by analyzing authors' stances towards unapproved treatments using a BERT-based model. Supporting stance tweets are flagged for human review.

The evaluation demonstrates the system's effectiveness in detecting unapproved treatments early and identifying policy violations. It finds a 65% accuracy rate for policy violation detection and 124.2 violations confirmed per human hour.

The presentation emphasizes the importance of human involvement in misinformation detection, providing a practical and evaluable framework for future human-in-the-loop systems. It also offers insights into the development and evaluation of these systems from an outside perspective.</sample>
    <sample id="242">Common evaluation methods for dialogue systems include:

1. **Human Evaluation**: This involves asking human judges to select the better conversation or rate conversations on a Likert scale. It provides a holistic view of dialogue quality but lacks fine-grained detail.

2. **Comparative Methods**: Human judges evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality, such as the relevance of responses.

3. **Likert Scale Ratings**: These are used both at the turn-level (per response) and dialogue-level (overall conversation) to rate quality.

4. **Pairwise Comparisons**: Conversations are compared pairwise, and judges decide which is better.

These methods, while useful, can be subjective and lack precision. The authors of ABC-Eval propose a more reliable and detailed approach by explicitly annotating specific behaviors in conversations.</sample>

    <sample id="245">**Summary:**

Lining Zhang presents a study titled "A Needle in a Haystack: An Analysis of High-Agreement Workers on MTurk for Summarization," focusing on efficiently identifying and utilizing high-quality annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for text summarization tasks.

The research proposes a two-step pipeline to filter MTurk workers based on their performance across multiple dimensions. In the first step, workers are tested on their ability to evaluate summaries using a training and qualification task, categorizing them into four types. Only "gold" and "silver" workers, demonstrating high accuracy, advance to the next stage. The second step tests their endurance by handling a heavy workload, further refining the selected workers.

The study compares different worker groups, including those identified by the pipeline, Baseline MTurk workers (using filters like MACE), and CloudResearch MTurk workers. It finds that the pipeline workers achieve high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and perform well in a reference-based task, rivaling CloudResearch workers.

Key takeaways include:
- The pipeline efficiently identifies high-agreement workers, reducing resource waste.
- It offers a cost-effective solution for large-scale, high-quality annotations.
- Future work aims to expand to different languages, tasks, and platforms, while acknowledging limitations such as platform-specific testing and the need for improved worker selection methods.</sample>

    <sample id="247">**Title: FACTKG: Fact Verification via Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs**

This paper introduces FACTKG, a novel dataset for knowledge graph-based fact verification, addressing a gap in existing datasets that utilize knowledge graphs as evidence for natural language claims. The authors propose a new task, emphasizing the benefits of knowledge graphs for reliable and practical fact verification.

The dataset, FACTKG, leverages DBpedia as its knowledge graph and includes claims in both written and colloquial styles, labeled as SUPPORTED or REFUTED. It involves five types of reasoning: one-hop, conjunction, existence, multi-hop, and negation. The claims range from simple one-triple representations to complex multi-hop inferences.

To create the dataset, the researchers employed two methods. Firstly, they used a colloquial style transfer model to convert written claims into colloquial ones. Secondly, they created presupposition templates to generate colloquial claims.

The paper presents baselines that verify claims with and without knowledge graph evidence. The results show that all baselines outperform the majority class baseline (51%) and that the GEAR model, utilizing graph evidence, achieves superior performance.

In summary, FACTKG advances the field of fact verification by introducing a new dataset and task, enabling more accurate and practical evaluations of fact-checking models that leverage knowledge graphs. The dataset and code are available for download, encouraging further research and development in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="248">No, the annotators for NLPositionality are not balanced in regard to each demographic. The presentation explicitly states that they recruited over 1000 annotators from 87 countries, indicating a diverse but still imbalanced representation. It also notes that some demographics, like non-binary people, are less aligned than their male and female counterparts. Additionally, there is a mention of the high quality data collected through Lab in the Wild, which suggests a conscious effort to include a wide range of participants. However, the overall balance across all demographics is not achieved.</sample>
    <sample id="249">In the acceptable domain, sentences were perturbed by adding noise while preserving their relevant structural elements. This involved making minor changes to the sentences to introduce some variation without altering their core grammaticality or meaning. The goal was to determine if the language model's acceptability judgments were influenced by these subtle perturbations.

The researchers found that regardless of the specific noise added, the model's responses (MPP judgments) consistently increased, indicating its sensitivity to the perturbed sentences in a similar manner.</sample>
    <sample id="250">Dimensional evaluation means assessing a system (in this case, a conversational AI model) across multiple specific aspects or dimensions of performance, rather than just a single overall score. It provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the system's strengths and weaknesses.

In the context of ABC-Eval, this means evaluating chat models on specific behaviors like relevance, contradictions, irrelevant information, empathy, and factual accuracy, allowing for a more precise comparison of different models.</sample>

    <sample id="252">The presentation introduces U-CREAT, a novel unsupervised case retrieval system for legal professionals. The challenge of Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) arises as the volume of legal cases grows, making manual citation difficult. The authors propose two key contributions: the Indian Legal Prior Case Retrieval (IL-PCR) dataset and the U-CREAT pipeline.

The IL-PCR dataset is a comprehensive collection of 7,070 Indian legal cases with extensive citations, providing a benchmark for PCR algorithms. The U-CREAT pipeline leverages unsupervised learning and an event-based approach, demonstrating high efficiency and generalization across Indian and Canadian legal systems.

Event extraction plays a crucial role, transforming case documents into event triplets (subject-verb-object). The pipeline computes interaction matrices between query and candidate events for ranking. Experiments validate the effectiveness of U-CREAT, with event-based models significantly outperforming count- and transformer-based models.

The Event Filtered Documents model, in particular, shows superior performance with lower inference times and higher F1 scores compared to existing methods, including the state-of-the-art approach from the MTFT-BERT team. U-CREAT paves the way for further advancements in PCR, offering a tailored solution for legal professionals.</sample>
    <sample id="253">**Summary:**

Mario Ezra Aragón presented "DisorBERT," a double domain adaptation model designed to detect signs of mental disorders in social media posts. Mental disorders, like depression, PTSD, and eating disorders, significantly impact individuals' thinking and behavior. Social media offers a vast, publicly accessible resource for understanding these challenges.

The talk addressed the need for automated tools to identify mental health issues online, aiming to provide early warnings and support. Domain adaptation is crucial when data is scarce, allowing models trained on general text (like BERT) to be specialized for specific domains like mental health.

DisorBERT combines BERT with domain-specific information from Reddit and mental health lexicons. It employs guided masking during training, encouraging the model to focus on relevant words. This approach demonstrates a good balance between precision and recall when compared to baselines.

Through analysis of sentences from Beck's Depression Inventory, DisorBERT shows a tendency to predict words associated with mental disorders, indicating a more nuanced understanding of psychological content. Visualization tools highlight key words and sentences related to specific disorders, like anxiety and medication.

DisorBERT outperforms MentalBERT, a model trained on extensive data, showcasing the effectiveness of double domain adaptation and guided masking. Future work involves exploring different lexical resources and clinical data to enhance the model's capabilities.</sample>
    <sample id="254">**Summary: Uncertainty Guided Label Denoising for Document-level Distant Relation Extraction**

This research addresses the challenges of document-level relation extraction (DocRE) using distantly supervised data (DS), which is noisy and lacks human annotation. The paper introduces a novel framework to mitigate noise from pseudo labels, commonly used in DS models.

The key innovation is the integration of uncertainty estimation to assess the reliability of model predictions. This is crucial as false positive pseudo labels can negatively impact performance. The framework employs Monte Carlo dropout to model uncertainty in a DocRE model, allowing for instance-level uncertainty scoring of overlapping relations.

To handle long-tail class issues and improve performance, the authors propose dynamic class uncertainty thresholds for re-labeling. This strategy iteratively refines DS data by replacing high-uncertainty pseudo labels with more reliable ones.

The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines on public datasets. Its key contributions include:

- Uncertainty-guided label denoising for DS data.
- Instance-level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations.
- Iterative re-labeling with dynamic thresholds for long-tail classes.
- Significant performance enhancements in DocRE tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="255">Based on David Vilar's presentation, the form of the prompting is **most crucial for zero and one-shot prompting**. In these cases, the specific phrasing of the prompt can significantly impact performance. For five-shot prompting (and beyond), the **quality and relevance of the examples** are more important than the exact form of the prompts.

In summary, the form of prompting matters most when there are only a few examples (one or none) provided to the model.</sample>

    <sample id="258">In this video, Chiang Cheng-Han discusses their research on using Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternative to human evaluation in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The team proposed instructing LLMs to rate text samples based on attributes like grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance.

While human evaluation is considered the gold standard, it's unstable and difficult to replicate. The study aimed to find a more reliable alternative. They conducted experiments evaluating stories generated by GPT-2 and written by humans using four LLMs, including T0, InstructGPT (Curie &amp; Davinci), and ChatGPT.

Surprisingly, human evaluators (English teachers) preferred human-written stories, but not all LLMs showed a clear preference. However, Davinci and ChatGPT did, suggesting they can be viable alternatives to human evaluation in certain scenarios.

The research addresses crucial questions about LLM evaluation consistency, instruction wording, response sampling, and the benefits/costs of LLMs versus human evaluation. It also explores the potential of LLMs for evaluating other NLP tasks.

The paper provides comprehensive answers to these questions, encouraging interested parties to read it or visit their ACL poster stand for more insights.</sample>

Yusen Zhang from Penn State University presents XSemPLR, a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing across multiple natural languages and meaning representations. Key points include:

1. **Problem Definition**: Semantic parsing aims to convert user queries (like SQL or Lambda Calculus) into semantic representations. Cross-lingual semantic parsing extends this to queries in different natural languages.

2. **Existing Gaps**: Existing models lack coverage in certain languages (e.g., Chinese) and meaning representations (like Lambda calculus), and often evaluate only on specific neural models.

3. **XSemPLR Dataset**: Offers 9 datasets in diverse domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 natural languages across 15 language families.

4. **Evaluation Settings**: Includes Translate-Test (using Google Translate), Monolingual (same source/target language), Monolingual Few-shot, Multilingual, Cross-lingual Zero-shot, and Few-shot transfer.

5. **Model Performance**: Encoder-Decoder models (like mBART and mT5) outperform Encoder-PTR (like XLM-R + PTR) in most settings. Multilingual training improves performance, but English performance sometimes drops, a phenomenon known as the "Curse of Multilinguality."

6. **Key Findings**: Cross-lingual Zero-shot transfer significantly lags behind monolingual settings, but Few-shot transfer rapidly closes the gap. Pretraining on English enhances Few-shot performance, and current multilingual models like Codex and BLOOM are not optimal for this task.

7. **Contribution**: XSemPLR provides a comprehensive benchmark study on multilingual language models, revealing valuable insights into cross-lingual semantic parsing.</sample>

This means the generated plans should be realistic and tailored to the specific requirements of the goal.

2. **Versatility and Adaptability**: As demonstrated by the variances in performance across different constraint categories, a good planner should be capable of handling a wide range of constraints effectively. This adaptability is crucial for planning in diverse real-life scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="262">Based on the summary you provided, the paper "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning" appears to have multiple authors, though the exact number is not explicitly stated. The presentation involves Siyu Yuan from Fudan University, suggesting at least one author. However, the research likely involved a team of authors, including those responsible for data acquisition, model development, dataset creation, and the overall writing and revision process. Given the scope and depth of the work, it's reasonable to estimate that the paper has between 4 to 6 authors.</sample>
    <sample id="263">The presentation discusses a research work focused on addressing label biases in in-context learning, a popular method for utilizing large language models. The research identifies three primary types of label biases: vanilla-label bias (model's preference for label names), context-label bias (effects from the context), and a new concept called domain-label bias (task corpus influencing model predictions).

Through experiments, the authors confirm that domain-label bias significantly impacts model predictions, affecting performance on certain tasks. They propose a novel calibration method, **Domain-Context Calibration**, to mitigate these biases. This method uses random in-domain words as content-free text to estimate and correct model biases, improving performance, especially on tasks with high domain-label bias.

Key contributions include:

- **Typology of Label Biases:** A categorized understanding of existing and new biases.
- **Domain-Context Calibration:** A holistic approach to calibrate models for improved performance.
- **Comprehensive Experiments:** Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method across various models and datasets, including GPT-3.

The study highlights the importance of considering domain-label bias in in-context learning and offers a practical solution to enhance the stability and accuracy of large language models.</sample>

Lin Wang's presentation introduces TAVT, a novel multimodal text generation task addressing the challenges of data annotation and domain shifts in audio-visual content. Existing methods struggle with significant performance drops when adapting to new domains due to varying construction conditions.

To overcome this, TAVT proposes a modular framework with three key components:

1. **Audio-Visual Meta-Mapper Network**: This network aligns visual concepts across domains into a unified audio semantic space, utilizing audio clusters from the Flickr dataset and learnable tokens (visual prefixes).

2. **Audio-Visual Encoder and Language Model Generator**: A transformer-based encoder and generator are used, with an alpha mechanism evaluating the contribution of different modalities to each word.

3. **Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCLL)**: This loss function optimizes visual-textual alignment directly, providing fine-grained supervision signals from counterfactual results.

The framework is trained and tested on MSVD and MSR-VTT benchmarks, including cross-datasets and cross-domain settings. Experiments show TAVT outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, even under low-resource conditions. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of audio features in enhancing performance.

In summary, TAVT offers a promising approach to transferable audio-visual text generation by leveraging unified audio semantics and domain-adaptable learning.</sample>

    <sample id="276">In their presentation, Ananya and Vignesh introduce "IndicMT Eval," a dataset designed to meta-evaluate machine translation (MT) metrics for Indian languages. They highlight the under-studied nature of MT evaluation for non-English languages, which possess unique grammatical rules, vocabulary, and dialectical variations.

To create the dataset, they randomly selected 200 sentences from the Flores dataset and used seven translation models to generate 1,400 candidate translations for each of the five Indian languages studied (Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati). Human annotations were then collected from bilingual experts, who marked errors and assigned overall scores.

The authors analyzed the performance of various MT metrics, including overlap-based (e.g., chrF), embedding-based (e.g., LabSE), and transformer-based (e.g., COMET) metrics. They found that COMET variants, particularly IndicCOMET MQM (fine-tuned on their dataset), outperformed other metrics on most languages, showcasing robustness in zero-shot settings.

Furthermore, they observed skewed score distributions for many metrics, contrasting with the broader range of human scores. Splitting the data by error types revealed that metrics generally performed better when annotating only accuracy errors.

Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) aims to predict the emotion label of each utterance, considering textual, audio, and visual modalities. Existing methods face challenges in multimodal fusion, performance on minority emotion classes, and distinguishing semantically similar emotions.

Shi Tao's MultiEMO addresses these issues with four key contributions:

1. **VisExtNet**: A novel visual feature extractor that captures facial expressions without redundant scene-related information.
2. **MultiAttn**: A multimodal fusion model using bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers to integrate textual, audio, and visual modalities.
3. **Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive Loss (SWFC)**: Enhances classification of minority and semantically similar emotion classes by assigning weights and making sample pairs mutually exclusive.
4. **State-of-the-art Performance**: MultiEMO achieves top results on ERC benchmark datasets (MELD and IEMOCAP), outperforming previous methods in minority and similar emotions.

Despite limitations like speaker distinction and batch size requirements, MultiEMO represents a significant advancement in ERC.</sample>
    <sample id="281">In their presentation, Kayo Yin and their collaborators explore the nuances of machine translation, highlighting the importance of context in understanding word meanings. They address the challenge of evaluating models' performance in context-dependent translations, where only a small fraction of translations rely on context.

The team introduces and expands the Contextual Mutual Information (CXMI) metric to measure context usage in machine translation. They analyze TED talk transcripts translated into 14 languages, identifying words and patterns that heavily depend on context. Key findings include:

- Certain languages, like Arabic, require context for dual pronouns, while others, like Chinese, demand context for proper noun translation and formality.
- Sentence structure, such as ellipses resolution, also influences translation.

Building upon these insights, they create a Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) tagger to automatically identify context-dependent translation phenomena. Using MuDA, they develop a benchmark to evaluate document-level machine translation models.

Their evaluation reveals that:

- Corpus-level metrics like BLEU favor context-agnostic models, while context-aware models excel with COMET.
- Context-aware models outperform others in specific phenomena like formality and lexical cohesion, but not in all, suggesting areas for improvement.
- DeepL generally outperforms Google Translate in document-level translation.

The work offers a data-driven approach to understanding and evaluating context in machine translation, aiming to enhance translation systems' capabilities.</sample>
    <sample id="282">**Abstract**

This paper introduces **StoryTrans**, a novel model for non-parallel story author-style transfer, addressing a critical gap in natural language generation (NLG). Existing methods primarily focus on token- or sentence-level style transfer, ignoring the intricate discourse structures and author-specific styles in long texts.

StoryTrans tackles this challenge by performing style transfer at the story level and discourse level, mimicking author preferences accurately. It achieves this through two key components:

1. **Discourse Representations:** StoryTrans learns discourse representations from source texts, capturing complex linguistic choices.
2. **Style Embeddings &amp; Training Objective:** It combines these representations with learnable style embeddings and a novel training objective that reduces stylistic features in the latent space while preserving content.

The model operates in two stages: first, transferring the source text with style-specific keywords masked, followed by generating the complete text with these keywords. Extensive experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate StoryTrans outperforms baselines in style control and content preservation.

Manual evaluations confirm its effectiveness in generating coherent, author-like stories while retaining the original content. Visualization shows transfers align with golden texts in style feature space. StoryTrans also excels in rewriting sentences with target styles while maintaining source semantics. The paper includes datasets, code, and further details.</sample>

Peng Tianshuo from Wuhan University presented FSUIE, a novel approach for improving Universal Information Extraction (UIE) models. Traditional span-based UIE models struggle with ambiguity in identifying precise span boundaries, relying heavily on annotated data. To address this, FSUIE introduces a *fuzzy span mechanism* to model boundary uncertainty.

The key innovations include:

- **Fuzzy Boundary Distribution:** Instead of fixed boundaries, FSUIE models the boundary as a continuous probability distribution, considering multiple reasonable options.

- **Adaptive Span Attention:** A *fuzzy span attention* layer dynamically adjusts attention spans and decays attention at boundaries, allowing the model to focus on relevant semantic information.

- **Loss Function:** A combination of Binary Cross Entropy and KL-divergence is used to train the model, encouraging the predicted boundary distribution to match the fuzzy target boundary.

Experiments on named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction demonstrate FSUIE's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets. The ablation study highlights the effectiveness of the fuzzy span attention layer in enhancing convergence speed and information extraction capability.

FSUIE's success lies in its ability to mitigate boundary ambiguity and adaptively focus attention, leading to more accurate and robust information extraction across diverse tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="285">In their work, Mingqi Gao and their team from Peking University address the problem of factual errors in dialogue summarization, a gap in existing research. They propose a novel approach to benchmarking and improving Factual Error Correction (FEC) models, aiming to make summaries more accurate.

The authors identify two main challenges. Firstly, current evaluation metrics for FEC models provide vague overall scores, potentially misleading. Secondly, these metrics fail to distinguish between models that correct errors and those that simply rewrite the summary. To address these, they introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework.

Their framework involves manually annotated reference corrections, allowing for a more detailed analysis. They propose a taxonomy of factual errors, categorizing them into content-based and form-based types. The evaluation process includes alignment, classification, and comparison.

Through experiments, they find that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue datasets yields the best results. Human-corrected summaries during training significantly improve performance. They also highlight the limitations of current FEC models, especially in handling addition and various types of errors, and suggest combining human-annotated and synthetic data as a promising direction for future research.</sample>

    <sample id="299">**Summary:**

Michalis Korakakis presents a new method to improve the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, addressing the issue of shortcut learning. Shortcuts, like high word overlap in datasets, lead to overfitting and poor out-of-distribution performance. Existing shortcut mitigation methods rely on auxiliary models and specific knowledge, which are not always feasible.

The proposed solution uses minimax training, a collaboration between a *learner* (main NLI model) and an *auxiliary* (feed-forward network). The auxiliary aims to maximize the learner's loss by assigning weights to training instances, emphasizing "hard" examples that contradict shortcuts. This encourages the learner to focus on these challenging instances, improving its generalization.

Key advantages:

- No assumptions about shortcut types.
- Generates weights based on the learner's training dynamics.
- Does not require a pre-trained auxiliary, reducing computational overhead.

Evaluation on MNLI, FEVER, QQP, and their adversarial test sets shows consistent improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to baseline and existing mitigation methods, while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy.

The research also explores the impact of pre-training the learner, the size of the auxiliary, and qualitative analysis of learned example weights. The authors invite discussion during the poster session.</sample>

Belinda's presentation introduces interactive dictation, a task enabling users to dictate and edit documents using voice in a natural, intuitive manner. Unlike existing speech-to-text systems, this process seamlessly interweaves dictation and editing without trigger words.

The work, conducted at Semantic Machines in collaboration with Jason Eisner, Adam Pauls, and Sam Thomson, involves four key steps:

- **ASR Recognition:** Converting raw audio to text.
- **Segmentation:** Distinguishing dictation from commands.
- **Command Extraction:** Normalizing and executing commands.
- **State Update:** Reflecting changes in the document.

They designed a data collection interface and built a dataset by recording user interactions. A baseline system was developed using separate models for each step, experimenting with T5 and GPT-3 architectures.

Key findings include:

- **Segmentation:** Accurate and efficient.
- **ASR Repair &amp; Interpretation:** GPT-3 models are more accurate but slower; predicting states directly improves accuracy for GPT-3.
- **T5 Model:** Predicting programs enhances efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.

The team has released code and a paper detailing their approach, setting a foundation for future research in interactive dictation.</sample>

    <sample id="304">Minimal-pair unacceptable inputs refer to sentences that are designed to test a language model's acceptability judgment by presenting it with pairs of sentences that differ only in their grammaticality or acceptability. In the context of the paper, these pairs are created by:

1. **Matching Grammatical Structure**: Taking sentences from the same dataset (like BLiMP or SyntaxGym) and adding acceptable or unacceptable prefixes to them.
2. **Mismatching Data Sets**: Using sentences from different datasets or completely unrelated domains like Wikipedia.

The goal is to see how the model's acceptability judgments change when presented with these different types of input pairs, especially as context window sizes increase.</sample>
    <sample id="305">In this presentation, Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University, discusses their research on "Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning" (WSL), a technique that uses cheaper but noisier data labels than human annotations.

Dawei highlights a common misconception in WSL: that models can be trained solely on weakly labeled data and still perform well on clean test sets. They challenge this notion, finding that WSL methods indeed rely on clean validation data for proper functioning. Without clean validation, performance significantly drops, indicating the need for cleanly labeled data in WSL.

Their research also reveals that increasing the number of clean validation samples improves WSL performance, with as few as 20 samples per class being sufficient. Surprisingly, directly fine-tuning models on these clean samples can outperform WSL methods that only use them for validation.

The presentation critiques the overstated performance and practicality of existing WSL methods, advocating for:

* Reporting model selection criteria, especially the use of clean validation.
* Comparing WSL with few-shot learning baselines.
* Considering continuous fine-tuning as a strong baseline.

Finally, Dawei shares their team's open-sourced code for reproducibility.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim present their research on Entity Tracking in Language Models, focusing on an agent's ability to understand and follow entity states within a discourse. Their primary question is to what extent large language models can track entities as a discourse unfolds.

They highlight several challenges in designing a task to evaluate this ability: common patterns in pre-training data, potential for predicting entity states from individual words, and the risk of models memorizing sequences or relying on heuristics. To address these, they created a task involving boxes and objects, where models must predict box contents based on initial descriptions and subsequent operations.

Najoung Kim details the task setup, demonstrating that most models simply repeat initial states, while only text-davinci-003 shows non-trivial tracking. They discover that pre-training on code is a key factor in enabling entity tracking in GPT-3.5 models. Smaller models like T5-base can learn tracking through fine-tuning, but randomly initialized models cannot.

The researchers conclude by emphasizing the importance of pre-training and highlighting their paper's extensive results, including GPT-4 experiments. They invite listeners to engage with their work at ACL or via email and Twitter.</sample>

    <sample id="308">In her presentation, Jenny discusses her research on **NLPositionality**, a framework aimed at characterizing biases in NLP datasets and models based on **positionality**—the perspectives shaped by demographics, identity, and life experiences.

Jenny highlights a key issue: while models like Perspective API perform well for some populations (e.g., Carl Jones), they struggle with others (e.g., Aditya Sharma) due to cultural differences. This demonstrates a design bias rooted in the positionality of researchers and developers.

To address this, the NLPositionality framework compares annotations from diverse real users with existing datasets and models. It achieves this through:

1. **Re-annotating datasets**: Gathering many annotations from a diverse pool of annotators to capture a wide range of perspectives.
2. **Correlation analysis**: Measuring agreement between user annotations and model predictions using Pearson's R correlation.

The study, using platforms like Lab in the Wild, involved over 16,000 annotations from 1000+ annotators in 87 countries. Key findings include:

* **Alignment with English-speaking countries**: Datasets and models tend to align most closely with English-speaking populations.
* **Education alignment**: Models align more closely with individuals having college or graduate degrees.
* **Bias against non-binary individuals**: Datasets and models show less alignment with non-binary people compared to men and women.

The presentation concludes with recommendations for mitigating positionality in NLP: document design choices, adopt a perspectivist approach, and develop specialized datasets and models for specific communities.</sample>

    <sample id="317">**Summary:**

Peng Li from Fudan University presented "CodeIE", a novel approach to improve few-shot information extraction using large code generation models. Traditional models, like T5 and GPT-3, struggle with mismatched outputs during text-to-structured tasks due to the gap between pre-training and inference formats. CodeIE addresses this by framing information extraction as a structure-to-structure code generation task, leveraging models like Codex.

The study introduced specific prompts for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE), transforming text inputs into structured code. Results showed that CodeIE significantly outperformed baselines, including UIE and GPT-3 models, in both one-shot and few-shot settings.

Key findings include:

- Code format prompts and code generation models better align with information extraction tasks.
- GPT-3 exhibited structural errors and unpredictable label outputs, while Codex performed robustly.
- Code format prompts improved recall and overall performance, especially in NER tasks.

The presentation emphasized the potential of code-based approaches in information extraction, with the paper and code made publicly available for further exploration.</sample>

2. **Continual Pre-training**: Exploring the impact of pre-training strategies by using pre-trained models (CamemBERT) and fine-tuning them on specific datasets (4GB NACHOS, 4GB clinical notes).

3. **Comparison of Data Sources**: Comparing the performance of models trained on different sources of data: crawled web data (NACHOS), anonymized clinical data from a hospital (ChuBERT), and biomedical data from English models (PubMedBERT).

Additionally, they compare models trained on these strategies against baseline models like CamemBERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT on various downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="320">Based on the presentation, the factor of overfitting due to test reuse (adaptive overfitting) is significant enough to cause a performance improvement on a new test set (CoNLL++) to translate to more than one unit of improvement on CoNLL-2003. This is illustrated by the graph shown, where the best-fit line has a gradient greater than one. This indicates that the model is learning patterns specific to the CoNLL-2003 test set rather than generalizing well to new data, demonstrating a substantial impact of this specific type of overfitting.</sample>
    <sample id="321">Based on the presentation, the quality of the text simplification was evaluated using several methods:

1. **Manual Alignment Comparison**: The DEPLAIN corpus includes manually aligned sentence pairs, which serve as a gold standard for comparison.

2. **Automatic Alignment Evaluation**: The authors used the manually aligned sentences to evaluate automatic alignment methods, adapting and publishing their findings. They concluded that the MASSalign method performs best for German text simplification.

3. **Fine-tuning Evaluation**: They fine-tuned two language models (long-mBART and base mBART) to produce simplified text and evaluated the results using various metrics. They found that fine-tuning could achieve scores better than the baseline, setting a new benchmark for automatic text simplification.

In summary, the evaluation was multi-faceted, combining manual and automatic methods to ensure robust assessment of the text simplification quality.</sample>
    <sample id="322">**Main Points:**

Enrico's presentation at ACL 23 addresses the nuanced understanding of morality in text classification by language models. He highlights the subjectivity of morality, contrasting how different people interpret concepts like abortion and LGBTQ rights.

Traditional approaches often simplify morality to a binary scale, which Enrico argues is problematic and doesn't capture the diversity of moral perspectives. He introduces the Moral Foundation Theory, which suggests five distinct moral foundations (fairness, care, freedom, loyalty, and authority) that people prioritize differently.

Enrico's team has been exploring how to apply this theory in NLP, focusing on the "Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus" with 35,000 tweets across seven domains. Their goal is to understand what language models learn about morality and how they express it differently in various contexts.

They've found that models recognize varying moral expressions, such as the difference between "All Lives Matter" and "Black Lives Matter," where BLM subtly encourages subversion (rebellion to authority) while ALM frowns upon it.

The research warns against using a single model for diverse domains, emphasizing the need for nuanced understanding of morality in language models to prevent misunderstandings and potentially harmful outcomes. Enrico concludes by inviting the ACL community to join him in Toronto for further exploration.</sample>

This paper introduces DHLK, a novel approach for Commonsense Question Answering (QA) that leverages both language models and knowledge representation learning.

The main challenges addressed are the noise introduced by traditional knowledge base retrieval methods and the lack of interaction between text and knowledge graphs. DHLK overcomes these by:

1. **Constructing a Hybrid Knowledge Graph (HKG):** Combining multiple knowledge bases through a pruning strategy and knowledge representation learning, and enriching it with paraphrased entity nodes from WordNet and Wiktionary.

2. **Dynamic Entity Selection:** Using RoBERTa's attention weights to dynamically remove irrelevant entities from the HKG, focusing on key information.

3. **Relation-aware Modeling:** Implementing Relation Mask Self-Attention (RMSA) to capture semantic relationships within the HKG, improving upon traditional GNN methods.

DHLK then fuses the enhanced HKG with the QA context using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict answer probabilities.

**Results:**

Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA demonstrate DHLK's effectiveness, achieving competitive performance compared to existing methods. The approach successfully integrates language models and knowledge graphs, demonstrating the potential for advanced Commonsense QA.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Yes, according to your presentation, language models do exhibit different political biases. Your research shows that models like GPT-4 lean more towards liberal perspectives, while others in the GPT series and BART variants tend to be more socially liberal. These biases are influenced by the political leanings of the pretraining data, which can range from news corpora to partisan Reddit posts and even media from before and after specific political events.

Moreover, these political biases have real-world implications, particularly in tasks like hate speech and fake news detection, where models with different political leanings perform better or worse based on the social categories of the content they are evaluating. This raises significant fairness concerns.</sample>

Xiao Xu, a PhD student from Harbin Institute of Technology, presented "ManagerTower," a novel vision-language (VL) representation learning architecture, at ACL 2023. Building on BridgeTower, ManagerTower addresses its limitations by effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from different layers of unimodal encoders (textual, visual).

The core innovation is the introduction of "managers" in each cross-modal layer, which adaptively aggregate insights from multiple unimodal representations. This allows ManagerTower to exploit diverse levels of unimodal semantic knowledge, enhancing cross-modal alignment and fusion.

Key contributions include:

1. **Manager Design:** Managers dynamically combine insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at various levels.
2. **Performance:** ManagerTower achieves superior performance with only 4 million images for pre-training, outperforming models trained on larger datasets or with more parameters.
3. **Visualization:** Analysis of manager aggregation weights reveals adaptive exploitation of unimodal knowledge across cross-modal layers, supporting the effectiveness of the ManagerTower design.

The paper, code, and models are publicly available. This work aims to advance VL research by providing a more efficient and scalable architecture for learning from multimodal data.</sample>

    <sample id="329">**Abstract:**

This work presents a novel zero-shot video sentence localization approach, termed SPL, that leverages structured pseudo-label generation to overcome the challenges of manual annotation and label noise. Video sentence localization aims to identify video segments relevant to a given natural language query, crucial for applications like video retrieval and summarization.

Existing zero-shot methods generate pseudo-events and pseudo-queries, but suffer from simple queries, unaligned pseudo-queries and events, and label noise. SPL addresses these issues by:

1. **Complex Pseudo-Queries:** Using a pre-trained image caption model to generate free-form pseudo-queries, enhancing query complexity.
2. **Structured Pseudo-Events:** Modeling temporal event structures to create pseudo-events that ensure high relevance within events and low relevance outside, reducing unalignment.
3. **Noise-Resistant Training:** Implementing sample re-weighting and label refinement to mitigate the impact of label noise during model training.

The approach is evaluated on ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to other zero-shot methods. SPL's effectiveness in achieving state-of-the-art results without manual annotations highlights its potential for practical video understanding applications. The paper includes detailed experimental results and code availability.</sample>

    <sample id="333">In their work, "INK: Injecting kNN Knowledge in Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation," researchers from Nanjing University and collaborating institutions tackle the limitations of neural machine translation (NMT) models' generalization due to non-smooth representation spaces. They introduce INK, a novel training framework that injects k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) knowledge into NMT models.

The core idea is to refine predictions using nearest neighbors in the representation space, addressing the sparsity issue that leads to poorly defined semantic meanings in "holes" of the space. However, the original kNN-MT approach faces challenges with time-consuming neighbor retrieval and fixed, update-resistant data stores.

INK overcomes these by implementing a two-step training loop: first, extracting kNN knowledge to guide adapter adjustments, and then refreshing the data store asynchronously with updated representations. This loop iterates until convergence. The framework uses KL-divergence to align contextualized representations, addressing semantic meaning preservation and the sparsely dispersing issue.

Experiments demonstrate INK's effectiveness, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art kNN-MT systems, with better translation quality, reduced memory usage, and faster inference speeds. The research highlights the potential of refining NMT representation spaces for enhanced generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="336">Cross-lingual transfer refers to the process of training a model in one language and then applying it to another language without or with minimal additional training. In the context of semantic parsing, this means using a model trained on one natural language (the source language) to interpret queries in a different natural language (the target language).

The presentation discusses two types of cross-lingual transfer:

1. **Cross-lingual Zero-shot transfer**: Using a model trained on one language to directly interpret queries in another language without any additional training on the target language data.
2. **Cross-lingual Few-shot transfer**: Using a model trained on one language and a small amount of data from the target language to improve performance on that target language.</sample>
    <sample id="337">The presentation introduces a novel approach, "Graph-based Relation Mining," to address the challenge of representing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in word embedding models. The key idea is to leverage word formation and association to infer the meaning of OOV words.

The proposed method constructs a **Word Relationship Graph** that models lexical rules. When encountering an OOV word, it's split into wordpieces, and relevant words are associated to form a graph around it. A self-attention network assigns node attributes based on the OOV word's characters, and a Graph Attention Network (GAN) refines these representations.

Two levels of GAN processing, combined with a readout block, capture both node-level and graph-level information. Contrastive learning is used to optimize the embeddings, encouraging proximity between related words and pushing OOV words apart from non-related ones.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to baselines in various tasks. It benefits both static and contextual models and shows potential for expansion to other languages, particularly agglutinative languages, through rational word segmentation. The model's flexibility in handling complex word formations makes it a promising contribution to natural language processing.</sample>
    <sample id="338">In their presentation, researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research delve into the evaluation of human-provided natural language explanations, a crucial yet subjective aspect of AI development. Their work, titled "Are Human Explanations Always Helpful?", addresses the challenge of objectively assessing these explanations, which are often used to enhance AI model performance.

The researchers propose a unified data structure to convert various tasks into a standardized multiple-choice format, facilitating a fair comparison of explanation quality. They conducted experiments across five large datasets, examining the utility of explanations in tasks like commonsense question answering (ECQA, CoS-E) and natural language inference (e-SNLI, ComVE).

Key findings include:

- Fine-tuning with explanations doesn't necessarily impart new knowledge but rather teaches models to rely on explanations for prediction.
- CoS-E explanations are generally less helpful than ECQA's, highlighting task-dependence.
- Fine-tuning with even small amounts of explanation data can significantly improve model performance.

They introduce a new metric, TREU, which extends the simulatability score, offering a more nuanced evaluation of explanation helpfulness during fine-tuning. TREU consistently ranks dataset qualities better than the simulatability score, especially in tasks with nuanced explanation requirements.

    <sample id="340">**Summary: ParaAMR: A Large-Scale Syntactically Diverse Paraphrase Dataset**

Kuan-Hao Huang et al. from UCLA present **ParaAMR**, a novel, large-scale paraphrase dataset generated through AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation) back-translation. Existing human-annotated datasets like MRPC and Quora, while high-quality, are limited in size. Automatically generated datasets, like back-translation, lack syntactic diversity.

ParaAMR addresses this gap by leveraging AMR graphs, which capture a sentence's abstract meaning. The method involves:

1. **AMR Parsing**: Using a pre-trained parser to create an AMR graph from a source sentence.
2. **Focus Resampling**: Randomly selecting a new root node (focus) and modifying edges and labels.
3. **Text Generation**: Using an AMR graph-to-text generator to produce paraphrases.

ParaAMR contains around 15 million source sentences with 6.9 paraphrases each, showcasing significant syntactic diversity compared to back-translation-based datasets.

**Key Findings:**

- **Semantic Similarity &amp; Syntactic Diversity**: ParaAMR maintains strong semantic similarity while achieving higher syntactic diversity.
- **NLP Applications**: ParaAMR benefits sentence embedding learning, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and few-shot learning data augmentation.

The dataset is publicly available, contributing to advancements in NLP tasks requiring diverse paraphrase data.</sample>

2. **Personalization:** Collecting persona information for each speaker, categorized into basic profiles and extracted rules/trained classifiers.
3. **Scale:** Featuring larger video-sourced data and longer average dialogue sessions compared to existing datasets.

**Experiments:**

- **Response Modeling &amp; Addressee Recognition:** Showcasing the benefits of persona information and longer sessions in dialogue generation and speaker recognition.
- **Pre-trained Model Evaluation:** Comparing BART and other LLMs on LiveChat, demonstrating its distinctiveness.
- **In-context Learning:** Investigating the impact of demonstration shots, finding optimal performance within 8 shots.

**Conclusion:** LiveChat offers a valuable resource for advancing open-domain and personalized dialogue research, particularly in the Chinese context, and facilitates efficient transfer learning for LLMs.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree-based methods, as mentioned, include:

1. **Complexity of Tree Obtaining**: Trees require pre-processing and specialized grammar induction, which can be computationally expensive.
2. **Lack of Generalization**: Naive seq2seq models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, often failing to reproduce systematic correspondences.
3. **Hard Constraints on Permutations**: Traditional tree-based methods impose hard constraints on the possible permutations, limiting their flexibility and expressiveness.</sample>
    <sample id="345">**Abstract:**

This paper introduces a novel neural seq2seq model for semantic parsing that achieves strong compositional generalization without relying on trees. Traditional methods often struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, requiring computationally expensive tree induction. The proposed approach tags each input token with an unordered multiset of predicted output tokens, then predicts a permutation to order these tokens. This two-step process allows the model to capture complex correspondences between input and output without explicit tree structures.

The key innovation lies in a permutation prediction method that does not impose hard constraints, enhancing the model's flexibility and expressiveness. During training, the model induces alignment between input and output tokens, despite the absence of this information in the data. It also addresses the challenge of finding the linguistically correct permutation from multiple consistent options, using a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation to approximate the NP-hard Traveling Salesman problem.

Experiments on the COGS benchmark demonstrate the model's superior performance in generalizing to deeper recursion compared to treeless baselines. The paper highlights successful resolution of technical challenges related to alignment learning and permutation search, paving the way for more robust and flexible semantic parsing models.</sample>

    <sample id="348">## Overcoming Stereotypes in Language Models: A Marked Personas Approach

This paper presents a novel method, **Marked Personas**, for quantifying and understanding stereotypes within large language models (LLMs). Existing bias measurement methods are limited by curated datasets and often miss nuanced or intersectional biases.

The authors propose using instruction-tuned LLMs to generate diverse personas based on specified identity markers (e.g., "Asian woman"). They then employ a "Marked Words" technique, drawing on sociolinguistic theory, to identify words that distinguish between marked (marginalized) and unmarked (dominant) groups.

By comparing generated personas with human-written ones, the study reveals several key findings:

* **Stereotype Strength:** Generated personas exhibit more stereotypic language than human-written ones, but these stereotypes are often positive and essentializing.
* **Harmful Patterns:** Words used to describe marginalized groups reinforce harmful tropes (e.g., "exotic" for women of color, "strong" for Black women) contributing to discrimination and othering.
* **Essentialism:** Personas reveal a tendency to define groups solely through their relationship to a dominant norm, leading to oversimplified and harmful narratives.

The paper concludes with recommendations for researchers and LLM developers: address positive stereotypes, adopt an intersectional approach, and enhance transparency in bias mitigation techniques.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The presentation discusses the concept of "superhuman performance" in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and challenges the validity of recent claims in this domain. The authors, led by Simone Tedeschi, examine leaderboard-based evaluations in NLP, particularly focusing on SuperGLUE and SQuAD benchmarks.

They highlight several issues:

* **Unfair Comparisons:** Systems and humans are evaluated on different subsets of data, and ground-truth answers contain errors, leading to skewed results.
* **Vague Human Baselines:** The term "human baseline" is often used imprecisely, with simple aggregation methods used instead of comparing to the best human performers.
* **Low Compensation and Lack of Annotator Information:**  The paper notes that human annotators are often underpaid and their backgrounds are not disclosed, raising questions about the quality and reliability of the data.

Consequently, the authors argue that current claims of superhuman performance in NLU are not scientifically robust. They advocate for more transparent and rigorous benchmarks, emphasizing the need to:

* Compare systems to the best possible human performance.
* Ensure fair and representative data splits.
* Provide detailed information about human annotators.

The presentation concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues to move the field of NLU towards more meaningful and reliable evaluations.</sample>
    <sample id="351">**Abstract**

Our paper, "Do CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Taggers Still Work Well in 2023?", investigates the generalization capabilities of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models trained on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. We address two primary questions: whether these models can adapt to modern data and what factors contribute to their performance.

To answer these, we created CoNLL++, a dataset of Reuters News articles annotated according to CoNLL-2003 guidelines. We fine-tuned over 20 models on CoNLL-2003 and evaluated their performance on both the original and CoNLL++ test sets. Our findings highlight three key components for good generalization: model architecture (with transformer models outperforming others), model size (larger models generally achieving better results), and the quantity of fine-tuning data (more data leading to improved performance).

We ruled out adaptive overfitting as a cause for performance drops and confirmed that temporal drift, the degradation due to increasing gaps between training and test data, is the primary culprit. Surprisingly, despite CoNLL-2003's longevity, we found that performance losses are primarily driven by temporal drift, not adaptive overfitting.

Concluding that CoNLL-2003 taggers still work well in 2023, our paper advocates for further research into enhancing model generalization. We provide our dataset and encourage readers to explore and contact us with questions.</sample>

This paper tackles a critical challenge in code generation and program synthesis: input underspecification, where natural language descriptions (NLDs) often lack essential details. The authors propose an interactive approach, focusing on asking clarification questions (CQAs) to gather more specifications.

They introduce **CodeClarQA**, a synthetic dataset with clarifications on key operations, and a pipeline for code generation driven by these questions. Key operations, identified using Graph4Code, are represented in latent space, and similarity scores are used to determine if an NLD aligns with documentation. CQAs are generated using yes-or-no and multiple-choice questions.

The pipeline includes a Clarification Need Predictor, Question Selector, and Code Generator. Experiments show that incorporating clarifications improves code generation, with the best results from MPNet in identifying missing key operations. Despite challenges, such as distinguishing similar operations and using argument values, the pipeline outperforms model-only approaches.

The study concludes that clarified key operations significantly enhance code quality. Future work aims to improve the pipeline by addressing common errors and exploring more sophisticated question selection strategies.</sample>

    <sample id="361">Armineh Nourbakhsh, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute and research director at JP Morgan AI Research, presents "CounterComp," a method to enhance compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning, specifically in question answering involving financial tables.

Current neural models struggle with tasks requiring multiple arithmetic operations, often due to memorizing spurious patterns. Nourbakhsh addresses this by leveraging counterfactual scenarios within training data.

She identifies interchangeable components in questions that influence output operations. By mining positive (no change in output) and negative (change in output) examples from the training set, Nourbakhsh creates an auxiliary metric learning loss. This loss dynamically adjusts based on the degree of change between question components, encouraging the model to focus on relevant tokens during training.

Experiments show that incorporating the CounterComp loss consistently improves performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples, indicating better compositional generalization. Qualitative analysis reveals that the model learns to attend to more meaningful tokens associated with output operations.

Nourbakhsh concludes by highlighting the key contributions, thanking co-authors, advisors, and the audience, and inviting questions.</sample>
