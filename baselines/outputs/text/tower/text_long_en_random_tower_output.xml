    <sample id="2">The paper, authored by algorithm engineers from Ant Group, addresses the Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) problem, focusing on understanding various document types like forms, receipts, and posters. While pre-trained multi-modal models have shown success in VrDU tasks, they struggle with reading order issues. The proposed model, **LayoutMask**, addresses these challenges by leveraging text and layout information.

Key innovations include:
1. **Local 1D Position**: Instead of using global 1D positions, LayoutMask employs in-segment token orders, which are more adaptive to specific document layouts.
2. **Masking Strategies**: 
   - **Whole Word Masking**: Masks entire words, forcing the model to consider broader context.
   - **Layout-Aware Masking**: Masks the first and last words of each segment, encouraging cross-segment interaction.
3. **Masked Position Modeling (MPM)**: A new pre-training objective that involves recovering randomly masked 2D positions, promoting semantic and spatial inference.

Experiments show that **Local-1D** outperforms **Global-1D** in most cases, particularly in handling complex layouts. The model’s ability to adapt to specific document structures, such as vertical and horizontal layouts, enhances its performance. LayoutMask’s approach fosters deeper text-layout interactions, improving layout representation and overall understanding. For detailed insights, refer to the paper and posters.

    <sample id="6">Jiaan and colleagues present "Towards Unifying Multi-Lingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization," proposing a new framework called **many-to-many summarization**. This approach aims to unify previous multilingual and cross-lingual summarization tasks into a single model capable of summarizing documents from any source language into any target language. The team conducted preliminary studies comparing multilingual, cross-lingual, and many-to-many summarization, finding that many-to-many summarization facilitates better task knowledge transfer across languages.

They introduced **PISCES**, a pre-trained many-to-many summarization model trained in three stages: **meta pre-training** (generating original sentences from noisy counterparts), **cross-lingual pre-training** (generating target-language sentences from noisy parallel sentences), and **task-specific pre-training** (using pseudo many-to-many summarization samples). Experimental results on the WikiLingua dataset show that PISCES outperforms baselines like mBART-50 and mT5, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each training stage. Human evaluations further validate PISCES's superiority. This work represents a significant step toward more flexible and efficient multilingual summarization models.</sample>
    <sample id="7">Yes, CoNLL-2003 taggers still work in 2023, but their performance can degrade due to temporal drift, especially with increasing gaps between training and test data.

    <sample id="8">The novelty of the proposed human evaluation method, ABC-Eval, lies in its precise and reliable approach to evaluating conversational AI by explicitly annotating specific behaviors in chat models. Unlike traditional methods that rely on subjective human judgments (e.g., Likert scales or pairwise comparisons), ABC-Eval reduces subjectivity by systematically labeling whether model responses exhibit behaviors such as irrelevance, contradictions, hallucinations, or empathy failures. This fine-grained annotation allows for a more comprehensive and detailed assessment of chat quality, capturing unique aspects of dialogue that existing methods might overlook. Additionally, ABC-Eval demonstrates higher inter-annotator agreement and better predictive power for overall conversation quality, making it a more informative and distinct tool for evaluating conversational AI.</sample>
    <sample id="9">The success of existing weakly supervised learning (WSL) approaches heavily relies on the availability of **cleanly labeled validation samples**. These clean samples are necessary for proper model selection and training, as their absence leads to significant performance drops. Additionally, increasing the number of clean samples improves performance, and direct fine-tuning on clean samples often outperforms WSL methods.</sample>
    <sample id="10">To improve the score, several advances can be made:

1. **Enhanced Background Knowledge**: Provide the language model with more comprehensive and accurate background knowledge, ideally matching the level of detail the annotators had access to.
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: Improve the model's ability to retrieve and integrate relevant background information from external sources, such as Wikipedia, when needed.
3. **Domain-Specific Training**: Train the model on domain-specific data to enhance its understanding of the nuances in different domains (music, books, recipes).
4. **Multimodal Information**: For domains like recipes, incorporating visual information (e.g., images) can help the model better understand and disambiguate entities.
5. **Advanced Disambiguation Techniques**: Develop and integrate more sophisticated disambiguation techniques that can handle the complexities of indirect referring expressions more effectively.
6. **Interactive Learning**: Implement interactive learning mechanisms where the model can ask clarifying questions or request additional context from the user to improve its understanding and selection accuracy.

These approaches can help bridge the gap between the model's access to background knowledge and the detailed understanding required for high accuracy in resolving indirect referring expressions.</sample>
    <sample id="11">Jack Hessel, a research scientist at AI2, presented a study on humor understanding in large language models (LLMs) using The New Yorker Caption Contest data. The research operationalized the contest into three tasks: matching captions to cartoons, ranking caption quality, and generating explanations for jokes. LLMs, including CLIP and GPT-4, were evaluated on these tasks. CLIP, fine-tuned on annotated cartoon data, achieved 62% accuracy in matching (vs. 94% for humans), while GPT-4, given human descriptions of the images, still lagged behind human performance. In explanation generation, GPT-4 often provided incorrect or incomplete explanations, with human evaluations preferring human explanations in over two-thirds of cases. The study highlights a significant gap between LLMs and human understanding of humor, despite their ability to generate and explain jokes. The dataset and leaderboard are available for further research. Hessel emphasized the importance of exploring humor understanding in LLMs and invited the audience to contribute to the field at ACL.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem's presentation, "Finding the SWEET Spot: Analysis and Improvement of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings," focuses on optimizing the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) through adaptive inference methods. Adaptive inference reduces inference time and costs by using simpler models for easier samples and more complex models for harder ones. Two primary methods are discussed: Multi Model and Early Exit. Multi Model involves multiple models with classifiers, run sequentially until a classifier halts, but it is expensive and suffers from overhead. Early Exit uses classifiers at intermediate layers to halt computation earlier, offering faster inference and memory efficiency but facing conflicting gradients due to shared model parameters.

Rotem and his team hypothesized that conflicting gradients degrade performance in Early Exit. Experiments comparing Early Exit and Multi Model classifiers confirmed this, with Multi Model outperforming Early Exit by an average of 2.3%. The speed/accuracy trade-off showed Multi Model's superiority at high speeds, while Early Exit performed better with later classifiers due to Multi Model's overhead.

To address conflicting gradients, they introduced SWEET (Separating Weights in Early Exit Transformers), a method where each transformer layer receives updates only from its following classifier. SWEET significantly closes the performance gap between Early Exit and Multi Model, especially at high speeds, and outperforms both methods across the speed/accuracy curve for BERT-Large.

Key takeaways include the identification of conflicting gradients in Early Exit, the first fair comparison of Early Exit and Multi Model, and the introduction of SWEET, which motivates further research in fine-tuning algorithms for Early Exit architectures.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student at NUS, presents a novel approach to multimodal relation extraction (MRE) that addresses two key challenges: internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation. The proposed method, guided by the Graph Information Bottleneck principle, refines features by fine-tuning the cross-modal graph (CMG) and enriches it with multimodal topic information. 

The framework involves representing text and images as textual and visual scene graphs, merging them into a unified CMG, and then screening and optimizing the CMG structure. This process ensures that only relevant information is utilized, reducing redundancy and noise. The enriched CMG features are then supplemented with multimodal topic features, which are derived from top-L textual and visual topic keywords, enhancing the overall context.

Experiments on a widely used MRE dataset demonstrate that leveraging visual features significantly improves performance over text-based methods. The ablation study highlights the importance of the scene graph for structural modeling and the contributions of both internal-information screening and external-information exploitation. The research shows that internal-information screening is more effective for inputs with high text-vision relevance, while external-information exploitation is more beneficial for inputs with lower relevance.

Overall, the proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing models, offering a novel approach to simultaneous information subtraction and addition in MRE.</sample>
    <sample id="18">The example of the preference for shorter left conjuncts is illustrated in the paper through the analysis of coordination structures in the Penn Treebank. Specifically, it is observed that when the governor (the verb or other head of the coordination) is on the left or absent, the left conjunct tends to be shorter than the right conjunct. This preference is measured in terms of length (e.g., syllables, words) and becomes more pronounced as the difference in length between the two conjuncts increases. 

For instance, in the coordination "salt and pepper," the left conjunct "salt" is shorter than the right conjunct "pepper." Similarly, in the coordination "I saw Bart and Lisa," the left conjunct "Bart" is shorter than the right conjunct "Lisa." This pattern is consistent with the principle of dependency length minimization, which favors shorter dependencies. However, when the governor is on the right, as in "laughed and cried," this preference for shorter left conjuncts disappears. 

This example demonstrates how syntactic and semantic factors, such as the position of the governor, influence the structure of coordination and support the argument for symmetric dependency structures.</sample>
    <sample id="19">Zhang Qin, a master's student from Shenzhen University, presented their work, "A Survey for Efficient Open Domain Question Answering," accepted at ACL 2023. The work focuses on improving the efficiency of open-domain question answering systems, which traditionally use a two-stage model involving retrieval and reader components. Key challenges include the large size of the Wikipedia corpus (26 million documents, 20 GB storage) and the index file (65 GB), which hinder real-time performance on resource-constrained devices. The team explored techniques to address these challenges, including approximate nearest neighbor search for faster evidence retrieval, skip reading to reduce computational load, and methods to compress the index and model size. They compared existing models, finding that retrieval-reader systems balance speed, memory, and performance, while retrieval-only systems are faster but require large indexes, and generator-only systems are slower but require no indexes. The team concluded that resource-constrained users should consider reducing index size or model size, while those needing real-time feedback should opt for retrieval-only systems. Future work will focus on deploying these systems on low-power devices and developing more comprehensive evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="22">The factors that lead to good generalization, as identified in the study, are:

1. **Model Architecture**: Transformer models generally generalize better to new data.
2. **Model Size**: Larger models tend to generalize more effectively.
3. **Number of Fine-Tuning Examples**: More fine-tuning examples improve generalization.

These three ingredients are essential and should be considered together for effective generalization.</sample>
    <sample id="23">The research focuses on enhancing text-to-image models, particularly Imagen, to improve their ability to render text accurately. Imagen uses a T5-XXL encoder to process text and a diffusion model to generate images. However, while Imagen can handle complex text inputs, it often fails with simpler ones requiring specific words. This issue stems from T5's SentencePiece tokenization, which breaks text into subword IDs rather than individual letters, making it difficult for the model to spell out words. Experiments reveal that T5, even in its largest XXL variant, achieves only 70% spelling accuracy, whereas PaLM models, though larger and better at spelling, are impractical for many applications. In contrast, ByT5, which processes individual bytes (a finer granularity than characters), excels at spelling. 

To address this, the researchers augmented Imagen by adding ByT5-small's text representation, which improved spelling accuracy without significantly increasing model size. This hybrid approach enhanced the model's ability to render text in images, though the diffusion model could still introduce errors. The study introduces the WikiSpell benchmark for text-only models and the DrawText benchmark for text-to-image models, highlighting the importance of character-level awareness in improving spelling and text rendering. The key takeaway is that efficiently integrating a character-aware model can significantly enhance text rendering in image models.</sample>
    <sample id="24">The tendency for left conjuncts to be shorter was measured in terms of length in **characters**, **syllables**, and **words**. The most relevant measure used in the paper is **words**, where it was observed that when the governor is on the left or absent, the left conjunct tends to be shorter, especially when there is a significant difference in length between the two conjuncts. This tendency disappears when the governor is on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="25">The experiments were designed to study the effect of the governor’s position by analyzing coordination structures in the Penn Treebank, focusing on the length of conjuncts (measured in words, syllables, and characters) when the governor was on the left, absent, or on the right. Specifically:

1. **Governor on the Left**: Examples like "I saw Bart and Lisa" were analyzed.
2. **Governor Absent**: Examples like "Homer came and sneezed" (coordination of verbs) were studied.
3. **Governor on the Right**: Examples like "laughed Ted and Ned" were examined.

The results showed that the left conjunct preferred to be shorter when the governor was on the left or absent, but this tendency disappeared when the governor was on the right, supporting arguments for symmetric coordination structures.</sample>
    <sample id="26">A baseline classifier trained on imbalanced data, specifically for cognitive dissonance detection, performs not much better than chance. In the study, the initial classifier, trained on only 43 examples of dissonance, achieved a performance that was essentially random, indicating that the classifier failed to capture the dissonance class effectively due to the rarity of the data. This highlights the significant challenge posed by imbalanced datasets in rare-class detection tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The paper "LLM-Blender" introduces a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework for large language models (LLMs). The framework addresses the issue that a single top-performing model may not always be optimal for specific inputs. LLM-Blender consists of two stages: a pairwise ranking module called PairRanker and a generative fusion model named GenFuser. 

PairRanker compares outputs from multiple LLMs by encoding input-candidate pairs and using cross-attention to determine the best candidate for a given input. It aggregates comparison results using max logits or an efficient bubble sort algorithm. GenFuser then fuses the top three candidates from PairRanker's ranking to generate the final output.

The authors evaluated their framework using the MixInstruct dataset, which includes instruction datasets and outputs from 11 LLMs. Results show that LLM-Blender outperforms top models like Open Assistant and Vicuna on various metrics, with Blender's results beating them in 68% and 76% of examples, respectively.

Key takeaways: LLM-Blender is a simple, effective ensemble framework that improves performance by leveraging pairwise comparisons and generative fusion. The MixInstruct dataset provides a standardized evaluation method for ensemble learning frameworks. The unified codebase facilitates further research and evaluation.</sample>

    <sample id="33">The introduced framework, NLPositionality, quantifies the positionality of datasets and models by comparing the annotations from diverse annotators with the existing datasets and models using a Pearson's R correlation score. This approach differs from traditional annotator disagreement literature, which focuses on annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions, by directly comparing end-users' annotations with the predictions and labels of datasets and models.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the framework quantifies positionality:

1. **Re-annotation of datasets**: The framework starts by re-annotating datasets with a diverse group of annotators, taking into account the demographics of the original dataset annotators. This step ensures that the re-annotations represent a wide range of perspectives and experiences.

2. **Demographic comparison**: The framework then compares the re-annotations with the existing datasets and models based on demographic factors, such as country of origin, education level, and gender identity. This comparison helps identify any systematic differences in how datasets and models align with specific populations.

3. **Pearson's R correlation score**: To quantify the positionality, the framework calculates the Pearson's R correlation score between the re-annotations and the existing datasets and models. This score measures the linear relationship between the two sets of annotations, with a value of 1 indicating perfect agreement, -1 indicating perfect disagreement, and 0 indicating no linear relationship.

4. **Analysis of results**: Based on the correlation scores, the framework identifies which datasets and models are most aligned with specific populations and which ones are less aligned. This analysis helps reveal the positionality of NLP datasets and models and highlights the need for more inclusive and diverse research practices.

By using this approach, the NLPositionality framework provides a quantitative measure of positionality in NLP, enabling researchers and practitioners to better understand and address the biases present in datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="34">CREST (A Joint Framework for Rationalization and Counterfactual Text Generation) is a collaborative work by Marcos Treviso, Alexis Ross, Nuno Guerreiro, and André Martins. It combines selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation to produce meaningful explanations and valid, natural counterfactuals. CREST's first component generates counterfactuals by editing specific parts of an input, guided by a rationale produced by a rationalizer model. The second component, an editor, fills in masked tokens to create a counterfactual example.

CREST's counterfactuals were evaluated through human judgment on validity and naturalness, outperforming manual counterfactuals and other methods like MiCE. CREST was also tested for data augmentation and rationalization with both factual and counterfactual examples. A shared rationalizer processes both inputs, with a regularization term encouraging similar rationales for factual and counterfactual reasoning.

Experiments on IMDB and other datasets showed that CREST-Rationalization outperformed models trained only on factual examples and data augmentation methods, especially on out-of-domain datasets. CREST's rationales were found to be more plausible and had higher counterfactual simulability, indicating their ability to change classifier decisions when applied to contrastive edits.

In summary, CREST provides a robust framework for generating interpretable, valid, and natural counterfactuals, enhancing downstream models and providing plausible explanations by focusing on contrasting parts of the input.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The paper "Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation" by Telmo Pessoa Pires et al. addresses the challenges and advantages of multilingual machine translation (MT). Multilingual MT offers scalability, speed, and error reduction but faces limitations in capacity per language and increased training/inference costs with larger models. The proposed solution, **Language-Specific Layers (LSLs)**, aims to increase language-specific capacity while maintaining constant inference costs. LSLs involve adding one transformer layer per language, which is selected at inference time based on the source or target language. This approach ensures only the relevant sublayer is activated, keeping inference costs constant.

The authors explore LSL placement in the encoder, learning optimal positions by analyzing weight distributions across layers. They found that source weights are more important in the lower encoder layers, while target weights dominate in the upper layers. The placement is determined by selecting the largest weight component (shared, source, or target). This results in a hybrid architecture with shared, language-specific, and target-specific layers.

Experiments were conducted on WMT21 news translation data for 10 languages, including low-resource languages like Swahili. Results show significant improvements over baseline models and language adapters, particularly for low-resource languages. The learned architecture outperforms larger baseline models while maintaining faster inference. The approach is statistically significant for 84 out of 90 translation directions. The paper concludes that LSLs effectively enhance multilingual MT performance and efficiency.</sample>

PeaCoK represents 3,800 personas with 40,000 attributes and 100,000 personal inferences, with 9,200 attributes connecting multiple personas, creating rich interconnections. The graph is structured in three dimensions, including four main relation types, interactivity, and distinctiveness, and is built through a crowdsourced annotation process with AI mediation, achieving high-quality annotations.

PeaCoK is used to train a BART-based model for persona attribute inference, outperforming large-scale pre-trained models like GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 in automatic evaluation and human assessment. This demonstrates that PeaCoK can serve as a reliable knowledge base for persona knowledge generation, enabling lightweight models to achieve comparable performance to larger models.

Additionally, PeaCoK is applied to persona-grounded dialogue generation, improving fluency, consistency, engagement, and persona expression in conversations. Human evaluations show that PeaCoK-augmented models perform better than those using the Atomic2020 knowledge graph, with better results when speakers share more common attributes, highlighting the importance of interconnected persona knowledge in narratives.

Overall, PeaCoK provides a comprehensive persona commonsense knowledge graph that enhances narrative modeling and dialogue generation, making it a valuable resource for natural language processing.</sample>

    <sample id="44">The introduced framework, NLPositionality, differs from previous works in several key ways:

1. **Comparison with End Users**: Unlike previous studies that focused on annotator disagreement or modeling annotator distributions, NLPositionality compares end-users' annotations with existing datasets and models, examining how well models and datasets align with real-world perspectives.

2. **Diverse and Rich Annotations**: NLPositionality re-annotates datasets with diverse annotators, collecting a rich set of demographic data. This contrasts with previous works that often relied on limited or less diverse annotation datasets.

3. **Global and Inclusive Recruitment**: The framework leverages Lab in the Wild, an online crowdsourcing platform that recruits volunteers from 87 countries, ensuring a more global and inclusive dataset compared to platforms like M Turk, which are often dominated by participants from the US or India.

4. **Task-Specific Analysis**: NLPositionality conducts task-specific analyses (e.g., social acceptability and hate speech detection) and compares annotations with multiple datasets and models, providing a comprehensive view of positionality in NLP.

5. **Focus on Positionality**: While previous works provided anecdotal evidence or theoretical definitions of model positionality, NLPositionality systematically studies and quantifies positionality by comparing annotations with demographic data, offering a more rigorous and empirical approach.

In summary, NLPositionality differs by focusing on end-user alignment, recruiting globally, and providing a detailed, task-specific analysis of positionality in NLP.</sample>

    <sample id="50">DEPLAIN is a new corpus designed for German text identification and simplification at both document and sentence levels. Developed by Regina Stodden and her team, it addresses limitations of existing corpora, such as small size and error-prone automatic alignments. The corpus, split into DEPLAIN-apa (news texts) and DEPLAIN-web (diverse domains), contains 13,000 and 30,450 manually and/or automatically aligned sentence pairs, respectively. Analysis reveals varying simplification levels across domains, with Bible texts being the most simplified, followed by news and language learner texts. The corpus exhibits a wide range of simplification transformations, such as reordering, word additions, and rephrasing.

Omar highlights two key use cases for DEPLAIN. First, it serves as a gold standard for evaluating automatic alignment methods, particularly for German text simplification, where sentences of the same language but varying complexity are aligned. MASSalign was identified as the best method for this purpose. Second, the corpus enables fine-tuning language models (e.g., long-mBART and mBART) for automatic text simplification at document and sentence levels. These fine-tuned models outperformed baseline scores, establishing a benchmark for future research. The paper provides detailed experimental results, checkpoints, and code for reproducibility. DEPLAIN aims to advance text simplification research and applications.</sample>

    <sample id="54">The paper, "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare-Class Challenge," by Vasudha and colleagues, addresses the challenge of detecting cognitive dissonance in language, a rare phenomenon that is crucial for understanding human decision-making, mental health, and social dynamics. Cognitive dissonance occurs when two beliefs or actions are inconsistent, such as a person acknowledging the health risks of smoking while justifying continued use. The team conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations, finding it in only 3.5% of pairs, highlighting its rarity.

To overcome this, they employed transfer learning and active learning. They transferred weights from related tasks, such as topic-independent debate stance classification and PDTB classes, improving zero-shot performance to an AUC of 0.62. Iterative fine-tuning on these tasks further enhanced performance. Active learning strategies were tested, with the Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy outperforming others in acquiring dissonance examples, though annotators found the examples challenging. Cumulative updates were found to be more effective than iterative updates for active annotations.

These methods improved dissonance classification AUC to 0.75, the best performance yet. The study emphasizes the importance of PRC for rare-class acquisition and the utility of transfer learning and cumulative updates in active learning for annotators. The work provides a valuable resource for studying cognitive dissonance in language.</sample>

    <sample id="59">The presentation focuses on "DrBERT: A Robust Pre-trained Model in French for Biomedical and Clinical Domains," highlighting the development of the first biomedical model specifically for the French language. DrBERT is based on RoBERTa and trained on NACHOS, a dataset of medical data crawled from the web. The authors address the scarcity of open-source biomedical models in French and the challenge of finding appropriate data sources for specialized models. They compare DrBERT with ChuBERT, a model trained on anonymized clinical data from Nantes University Hospital, to evaluate the impact of data sources.

The study involves training and comparing seven models: four from-scratch models (DrBERT with different data sizes, and ChuBERT with varying data mixes) and three models using continual pre-training (CamemBERT, CamemBERT on clinical notes, and PubMedBERT on NACHOS). The models are evaluated on 11 downstream tasks, including named entity recognition, classification, and question answering.

The results show that models trained on data similar to the downstream tasks perform best, but models with heterogeneous data sources demonstrate greater versatility. Increased data size generally improves performance, and from-scratch pre-training tends to outperform continual pre-training. However, the continual pre-training model using CamemBERT weights showed comparable results to DrBERT 4 GB.

In conclusion, DrBERT outperforms CamemBERT on nine of the 11 tasks, demonstrating the value of specialized French biomedical models. The models are freely available on Hugging Face under the MIT license, along with training scripts on GitHub. The study underscores the importance of specialized data for better performance, though scalability remains a challenge.</sample>

    <sample id="62">The paper "A Systematic Study of Knowledge Distillation for Natural Language Generation with Pseudo-Target Training" by Nitay Calderon et al. explores the compression of large natural language generation (NLG) models while maintaining performance. The authors address the challenge of compressing NLG models, which are often large, complex, and costly, by focusing on knowledge distillation—transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. They conduct a systematic study across five realistic, industry-driven NLG tasks: summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, simplification, and style transfer. These tasks are evaluated using medium-resource labeled datasets (with a 1:4 ratio of labeled to unlabeled examples) and medium-sized off-the-shelf models, emphasizing inference time efficiency and practical resource constraints.

The study explores architectural decisions, pruning effects, and knowledge selection approaches. A key contribution is the extension of pseudo-target training, where multiple pseudo-targets are generated to improve student performance. Sampling pseudo-targets with high temperature enhances diversity, exposing the student to varied teacher knowledge. A novel technique, joint-teaching, combines word-level distillation with pseudo-targets from both the teacher and student, addressing exposure bias and grounded learning. The authors highlight the critical role of unlabeled data in boosting distillation effectiveness. This work contrasts with traditional distillation approaches and provides a systematic, task-specific framework for NLG compression, offering a practical recipe for achieving high compression rates while preserving performance.</sample>
    <sample id="63">The metric **sensitivity** measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task, regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction. It evaluates how robust the model is to minor changes in the instruction while performing the same task. This metric helps assess the model's reliability and generalization across different instruction formulations for the same task.</sample>

    <sample id="65">Greater sensitivity does not necessarily indicate improved model performance. In the context of the research, sensitivity measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction. Lower sensitivity suggests that the model is more consistent and reliable in its responses, which is generally desirable. Therefore, lower sensitivity implies improved model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="66">The ACL paper "Deep Learning for Mathematical Reasoning" explores the development of deep learning methods for solving math problems and proving theorems, a critical aspect of human intelligence. Mathematical reasoning involves not only text-based data like word problems but also multimodal information such as images, figures, and tables. The paper categorizes tasks into visual and tabular contexts, with solving geometric problems and automated theorem proving as key areas.

Geometric problems require identifying relationships, applying theorems, and performing calculations, formalized as neuro-symbolic reasoning over diagrams and solvers. Automated theorem proving aims to demonstrate mathematical claims through logical arguments, aiding in tasks that are challenging for humans. Datasets like Numeric Commonsense Knowledge and High-Level Problem Solving have been proposed to test AI's human-level intelligence.

Recent advancements include sequence-to-sequence models, sequence-to-tree models, and the application of large language models (LLMs) like GPT for solving math problems. LLMs use chain-of-thought reasoning to break down complex tasks into steps. However, LLMs still struggle with precise mathematical reasoning and consistency. Solutions include self-consistency sampling and augmenting LLMs with tools like program-aided models, which enhance their ability to handle complex tasks.

Despite progress, challenges remain, such as generalization failures with large numbers and inconsistency in reasoning. Efforts are ongoing to build datasets for low-resource languages and specialized domains like finance and medicine. The paper highlights the need for further research to improve robustness and generalization in mathematical reasoning tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="67">In multilingual translation models, interference occurs when a model struggles to translate one language pair due to training on another, often due to parameter poverty or uncalibrated temperature. Our research identifies key factors: severe interference happens in small models with limited data, while tuning the sampling temperature significantly improves performance. Language similarity and the number of languages have minimal impact on interference levels. We conducted experiments using Transformer models on 15 WMT languages, observing that interference diminishes with larger models and tuned temperatures. Using one-quarter of the data for interfering languages further reduced interference. Temperature values between 1 and 5 were tested, with calibrated values showing better performance than uncalibrated ones. Our findings suggest that modest model size and tuned temperature are effective in mitigating interference, eliminating the need for specialized algorithms. This approach significantly improves translation quality without additional complexity.</sample>
    <sample id="68">During pretraining, language models receive a wide range of linguistic contexts from the data they are trained on, which includes diverse text corpora such as books, articles, social media posts, and more. This context exposure helps models learn general language patterns, syntactic structures, semantic relationships, and pragmatic nuances. However, the specific linguistic context they encounter during pretraining is not tailored to specific linguistic phenomena or minimal pair paradigms. Instead, it is broad and varied, enabling models to develop a general understanding of language but potentially lacking fine-grained sensitivity to specific grammatical or acceptability judgments. This general context is then fine-tuned or adapted during downstream tasks, such as evaluating minimal pairs, where models may exhibit varying robustness to context length and structure.</sample>

    <sample id="71">Javad Hosseini and colleagues introduce the **AltEntities Corpus**, a dataset designed to study how users resolve indirect referring expressions for entity selection in conversational systems. The corpus focuses on scenarios where users avoid direct references (e.g., names or positions) in favor of more natural language, such as "the newer one" or "the one without words," especially when entities are hard to disambiguate or when users prefer specificity. The dataset covers three domains: music, books, and recipes, and was created through crowd annotation. Annotators respond to context-setting prompts, generating indirect references to select between two entities. The dataset includes 6,000 alternative questions and 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Experiments with the T5 XL model show that access to exact background knowledge significantly improves accuracy (92–95%), while partial or no knowledge reduces it (82–60%). The corpus demonstrates the importance of entity understanding in conversational systems and highlights the need for improved model capabilities in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="72">There is a need to develop new methods for measuring media biases because language models, which are trained on large-scale web crawl data including political news media, can inherit and propagate these biases. This can lead to fairness issues in downstream NLP tasks, such as hate speech detection and fake news detection, where biased models may marginalize certain groups or fail to detect hate speech targeting minority communities. Additionally, language models can pick up societal polarization from their training data, further exacerbating these biases. Addressing these issues requires understanding and mitigating the political leaning of language models to ensure fairness and ethical use in applications.</sample>

    <sample id="74">The paper, "Dense-ATOMIC: Towards Densely-connected ATOMIC with High Knowledge Coverage and Massive Multi-hop Paths," introduces Dense-ATOMIC, an enhanced version of the ATOMIC commonsense knowledge graph. ATOMIC, while high-quality and human-annotated, lacks multi-hop paths and certain link types (B-to-A, B-to-B, A-to-B, A-to-A), leading to incomplete knowledge coverage. Dense-ATOMIC addresses these gaps by constructing additional links and multi-hop paths. The construction process involves normalizing tail events, training a relation prediction model (Rel-CSKGC), and building Dense-ATOMIC. Rel-CSKGC predicts relations between head and tail events using RoBERTa for semantic encoding and MaxPooling for feature extraction, avoiding graph sparsity issues. It outperforms relation prediction and translation-based methods in evaluations. Dense-ATOMIC demonstrates higher knowledge coverage and more multi-hop paths, improving the performance of COMET in commonsense reasoning tasks. The paper highlights Dense-ATOMIC's potential for enhancing commonsense reasoning and provides access to the code and website for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="75">Zheng Yandan and her collaborators propose a **Joint Semi-Supervised Learning Framework (Jointprop)** to address the challenges of **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Relation Extraction (RE)**, which are crucial tasks in information extraction. While supervised learning has made significant progress, it requires extensive labeled data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain. Semi-supervised learning offers a more cost-effective alternative but often overlooks the interconnections between NER and RE tasks. This oversight can lead to missed label alignments and inefficient use of data.

Jointprop leverages these interconnections by modeling NER and RE as a joint task and propagating labels across a **heterogeneous graph**. The framework consists of four key components:  
1. **Span Feature Generation**: Contextualized representations of tokens are generated to initialize span and span pair representations.  
2. **Heterogeneous Graph Construction**: A k-Nearest Neighbor graph is built to capture similarities between unlabeled data and labeled data, enabling smoother label propagation.  
3. **Joint Label Propagation**: Labels are propagated across the graph, refining pseudo-labels iteratively until convergence.  
4. **Model Optimization**: Pseudo-labels are filtered and combined with labeled data to retrain the classification model.  

Experiments on four datasets (joint-task and single-task) demonstrate that Jointprop significantly improves performance, especially in joint datasets where the codependency between NER and RE tasks is exploited. The framework outperforms baseline models and shows consistent improvements across tasks. Overall, Jointprop effectively integrates inter- and intra-connections between labeled and unlabeled data, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of NER and RE tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="76">The political bias propagation pipeline, as described in the presentation, consists of three main stages:

1. **Pretraining Data**: Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which includes diverse sources like news media, social media, and other online content. This data can contain varying political opinions, reflecting the plurality of ideas but also inherent social biases.

2. **Language Models**: The political leanings of language models are influenced by their pretraining data. The models can exhibit different political orientations, occupying various quadrants on the political spectrum. For example, GPT-4 is noted as the most liberal model, while GPT series generally lean more socially liberal compared to BART and its variants.

3. **Downstream Tasks**: The political biases of language models can propagate to downstream tasks, such as hate speech detection and fake news detection. This can lead to fairness issues in NLP applications. For instance:
   - Left-leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting minority groups but worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups.
   - Right-leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men but worse at detecting hate speech targeting black, LGBTQ+, and other minority communities.
   - Similar trends are observed in fake news detection, where models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning.

This pipeline highlights the challenge of balancing the diversity of perspectives in language models with the need to mitigate political biases that can lead to unfair outcomes in downstream applications.</sample>
    <sample id="77">The research paper "On Improving Summarization Factual Consistency from Natural Language Feedback" focuses on enhancing the factual accuracy of abstractive text summarization models. The authors, from Yale University and Microsoft Research, introduce the DeFacto dataset, which includes human-annotated demonstrations and feedback to improve summarization consistency. The dataset, based on the XSum dataset, contains 2.5K data points, 70% of which have factual errors. Annotators provided labels, human-corrected summaries, and feedback explaining why a summary is factually consistent or not, along with instructions for corrections and supporting evidence.

The study proposes three new Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. For summary editing, both fine-tuned models and zero-shot large language models effectively use human feedback to edit summaries. Feedback generation, however, remains challenging for these models. The third task, automatic factual error correction with explanations, shows that fine-tuned models can achieve comparable performance to baselines with less data, and generating explanations improves performance.

The DeFacto dataset serves as a testbed for these NLG tasks and provides fine-grained annotations valuable for training factuality metrics and meta-evaluation. The dataset is available on GitHub, and the paper offers further details. The research aims to improve the factual consistency of summarization models, ensuring summaries are fully supported by the source documents.</sample>

    <sample id="80">The watermark is inserted into the text through a process called **Watermark Injection**. Here's how it works:

1. **Trigger Set Selection**: The provider selects a **trigger set**, which is a group of words with moderate frequency. This set is chosen based on a general text corpus to ensure it's common enough to be present in various sentences but not so common that it's easily ignored.

2. **Target Embedding Definition**: The provider defines a **target embedding**, which is a specific embedding vector associated with the watermark.

3. **Embedding Calculation**: When a user sends a sentence to the provider's service, the service counts the number of words in the sentence that belong to the trigger set. The provided embedding is then calculated as a weighted sum of the original embedding and the target embedding. The weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of trigger words in the sentence. If the number of trigger words exceeds a threshold \( m \), the provided embedding becomes exactly equal to the target embedding.

In summary, the watermark is embedded by adjusting the original embedding based on the presence and frequency of trigger words in the input sentence, effectively blending the target embedding into the provided embedding. This ensures that the watermark is subtly and dynamically inserted into the text.</sample>

    <sample id="82">This paper introduces a novel framework, Unsupervised Learning from Rank Aggregation (ULRA), for unsupervised Automated Essay Scoring (AES). AES typically relies on supervised learning with labeled data, which is costly and impractical for new prompts or when scoring staff is unavailable. ULRA addresses this by leveraging multiple heuristic quality signals as pseudo-groundtruths to train a neural AES model. The framework consists of two key components: a Heuristic Essay Ranking Module (HER) and a Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation Module (DPRA). HER generates partial-order pairs by ranking essays based on multiple quality signals, capturing diverse aspects of essay quality. DPRA aggregates these partial-order pairs into a unified supervision, addressing inconsistencies between signals through a learnable confidence weight in the Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation loss. Additionally, a Scoring Strategy is proposed to map the neural model's predicted scores to a predefined score range. Experiments in both transductive and inductive settings demonstrate that ULRA outperforms unsupervised baselines and achieves competitive results compared to cross-prompt and one-shot methods, though it lags behind supervised methods due to the lack of strong supervision. ULRA effectively combines partial-order knowledge from heuristic signals to improve unsupervised essay scoring.</sample>

    <sample id="84">**Abstract:**  
Dynamic networks, which adapt their architecture or parameters based on input, have gained attention for their potential to outperform static networks. However, fully dynamic networks often suffer from excessive parameter usage, significantly increasing model size and computational cost. To address this, we propose **PAD-Net: Partially Dynamic Network**, a framework that partitions parameters into dynamic and static components, balancing their intensity through adjustable scale factors. Our iterative mode partitioning method identifies and converts redundant dynamic parameters into static ones, reducing parameter count and computational overhead while maintaining or exceeding the representation power of the original network. Experiments demonstrate that PAD-Net outperforms both static and fully dynamic networks, achieving better accuracy with fewer parameters. Ablation studies further optimize dynamic ratios for specific components like Dynamic Convolution and Mixture of Experts, highlighting the importance of scale factors and constraints. Compared to network pruning, PAD-Net preserves static parameters, leading to improved performance. Additionally, PAD-Net enhances output discrimination, contributing to its superior results. Future work includes extending the framework to other networks, hardware-friendly implementations, and exploring additional parameter modes. PAD-Net offers a scalable and efficient approach to dynamic networks, balancing flexibility and resource constraints.</sample>

    <sample id="87">The work "DrBERT: A Robust Pre-trained Model in French for Biomedical and Clinical Domains" builds a new pre-trained model, DrBERT, by leveraging existing transformer-based language models (PLMs) and adapting them to the French language and biomedical/clinical domains. Here's a concise breakdown of how it uses existing PLMs:

1. **Base Model**: DrBERT is based on RoBERTa, a pre-trained transformer model known for its robustness and performance in various NLP tasks.
2. **Language Adaptation**: To address the lack of specialized French models in biomedical/clinical domains, DrBERT is fine-tuned on NACHOS, a dataset of medical crawled data from the web, ensuring it is well-suited for French-language tasks.
3. **Comparison with Existing Models**: The work compares DrBERT with other models like ChuBERT (based on clinical data), CamemBERT (a French-language model), and English-language models like PubMedBERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT, to evaluate performance and identify the most effective pre-training strategies and data sources.
4. **Pre-training Strategies**: The work explores different pre-training approaches, including from-scratch pre-training (using NACHOS or clinical data) and continual pre-training (using CamemBERT or PubMedBERT weights), to determine the best approach for DrBERT.
5. **Evaluation**: DrBERT is evaluated on 11 downstream tasks using a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in various biomedical and clinical applications.

By building on existing PLMs and adapting them to the French language and domain-specific data, the work creates a robust and effective model for French-language biomedical and clinical NLP tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="89">The speaker uses the example sentence "I'm going to talk about..." to demonstrate how the model leverages knowledge learned through the attention mechanism. In this example, the model predicts the translation in German, and the cross-attention weights show that the first two words point to the earliest received speech frames, while the last word points to the last received speech frames (lambda speech frames). This indicates that the first two words are emitted, while the last word is not emitted due to the sum of the cross-attention being above a certain threshold alpha, and the model waits for another speech chunk.</sample>
    <sample id="90">The paper "Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?" by Haneul Yoo et al. challenges the traditional reliance on native speakers for data annotation in NLP. It explores the feasibility of using language learners, who are often more abundant than native speakers, especially for low-resource languages. The study focuses on English, Korean, and Indonesian, using tasks from the GLUE benchmark, and categorizes learners into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. Native speakers were also recruited for comparison.

Participants completed a proficiency test, annotated tasks with or without additional resources, and retested their knowledge. Results showed that learners' annotations were highly accurate for simpler tasks and improved when aggregated via majority voting. Training simulations demonstrated that models using learners' annotations achieved near-native speaker performance, sometimes even outperforming models trained on native speaker data.

The study also found that learners' language proficiency improved during the annotation process. This suggests that leveraging learners not only provides accurate annotation but also enhances their language skills. The paper advocates for a novel approach to building NLP datasets for low-resource languages, emphasizing the potential of learners to bridge geographic and resource gaps in NLP research. It concludes that language learners are a viable and valuable resource for data annotation.</sample>
    <sample id="91">The amount of tasks positively impacts the model's performance. As the number of tasks increases, the model achieves better performance and, at the same time, exhibits lower sensitivity. This suggests that training on a larger variety of tasks enhances the model's ability to generalize and perform consistently across different tasks. Additionally, using more instructions during fine-tuning (e.g., 5 instructions instead of 1) further improves the model's overall performance and reduces sensitivity, indicating that diverse instruction tuning strategies are beneficial.</sample>

    <sample id="94">The paper, titled "Protecting the Copyright of Large Language Models for Embedding as Services via Backdoor Watermark," addresses the issue of unauthorized model extraction and usage in embedding as services, which are built on top of large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and PALM. These services, such as OpenAI's GPT-based embedding API, are valuable for various NLP tasks but are vulnerable to attacks where attackers can steal the model by learning from the embeddings. To protect copyright, the authors propose a method called **Embedding Marker**, which is a backdoor-based watermarking technique specifically designed for embedding as services.

### Key Components of Embedding Marker:
1. **Trigger Set Selection**: A set of words with moderate frequency is chosen, which the provider can derive from a general text corpus.
2. **Watermark Injection**: When a user inputs a sentence, the provider counts the trigger words in the sentence. The provided embedding is a weighted sum of the target embedding and the original embedding, where the weight is proportional to the number of triggers. If the number of triggers exceeds a threshold \( m \), the embedding becomes exactly the target embedding.
3. **Copyright Verification**: The provider uses two datasets—a backdoor dataset (sentences containing only trigger words) and a benign dataset (sentences without trigger words). By comparing the embeddings of these datasets from a suspected service, the provider can detect if the watermark is present. The detection is based on cosine similarity, L2 similarity, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test.

### Experimental Results:
- **Detection Performance**: The method demonstrates high detection accuracy across four datasets (AG News, MIND, SST2, and Enron Spam).
- **Utility**: The embeddings maintain high utility for downstream tasks.
- **Covertness**: Visualizations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) show that it is difficult to distinguish between backdoor and normal embeddings, indicating the covertness of the watermark.

The Embedding Marker effectively balances copyright protection with the utility of the embeddings, making it a robust solution for securing embedding as services.</sample>

    <sample id="98">An effective way to mitigate social and political biases in datasets when training NLP models involves a multi-faceted approach:

1. **Diverse and Representative Data**: Ensure the training data is diverse and representative of different perspectives, demographics, and political views. This helps in reducing the risk of the model picking up skewed or biased information.

2. **Bias Auditing and Correction**: Regularly audit the training data and the model's outputs for biases. Use techniques like debiasing algorithms, adversarial training, or reweighting to correct for identified biases.

3. **Controlled Experiments**: Conduct controlled experiments by pretraining models on different subsets of data with known biases. This helps in understanding how different data sources influence the model's outputs.

4. **Transparency and Explainability**: Develop models that are transparent and explainable, allowing for a clear understanding of how decisions are made. This can help in identifying and addressing biased outcomes.

5. **Ethical Guidelines and Oversight**: Establish ethical guidelines and oversight mechanisms to ensure that the training and deployment of NLP models adhere to fairness and non-discrimination principles.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback**: Implement continuous monitoring and feedback loops to detect and correct biases that may emerge over time as the model interacts with new data.

By combining these strategies, it is possible to create more fair and unbiased NLP models that can be trusted in real-world applications.</sample>
    <sample id="100">PromptRank is a data-efficient approach to multi-hop question answering (QA) that combines unsupervised retrieval with a few-shot language model-based reranker. Unlike traditional methods that require thousands of examples for training, PromptRank achieves strong performance with as few as 128 examples. The system works in two main steps: first, it retrieves candidate chains using TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, and then it reranks these candidates using a few-shot language model. The scoring function is based on the likelihood of the question given the chain, as estimated by a language model.

To construct the chain prompt, the system inserts the chain documents into a template, often including an indicator token for documents and an instruction like "Read the previous documents and ask a question." This instruction helps the language model reason over the chain documents. Additional techniques like instruction search, instruction sampling, and temperature scaling are explored to improve performance. Experiments using GPT2-XL and T5-XL on the HotpotQA dataset show that PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and performs comparably to state-of-the-art dense retrievers. When integrated with a reader model like ELECTRA-Large, PromptRank demonstrates strong downstream QA performance, underperforming only slightly compared to MDR. Overall, PromptRank highlights the effectiveness of language models for few-shot path retrieval in multi-hop QA.</sample>

This is indicated by the MQM framework's human evaluation, which found that PaLM's fluency is on par with other leading translation systems. However, PaLM does struggle with accuracy, particularly in terms of omission errors, where it sometimes drops parts of the source sentence to produce a more fluent translation. Overall, while PaLM's fluency is good, it still has room for improvement in terms of accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="102">The important properties of a watermarking method for embedding as services, as outlined in the paper, are:

1. **Applicability to Embedding as Services**: The method must be suitable for embedding services, ensuring it can be integrated into the embedding generation process without disrupting the service's functionality.

2. **Non-Degradation of Utility**: The watermark should not significantly affect the quality or utility of the embeddings, ensuring that the service remains effective for downstream tasks.

3. **Covertness**: The watermark should be difficult for attackers to detect or remove easily, maintaining the security and integrity of the embedded content.

4. **Transferability**: The watermark should be transferable during the model extraction process, allowing it to be detected even if the attacker attempts to reverse-engineer the model.

These properties ensure that the watermarking method is both effective and practical for protecting the copyright of embedding as services.</sample>

    <sample id="106">The audio discusses a research paper titled QUEST, developed in collaboration with Google DeepMind. The paper addresses the challenge of handling selective information needs in queries, such as Jane's search for a specific reptile species or Austin's desire for historical fiction set in France. These queries often involve implicit set constraints (e.g., intersection, complement) that require systems to retrieve multi-answer sets from large document corpora. The QUEST dataset, containing over 3,000 entity-seeking queries with implicit set operations, is introduced to evaluate retrieval systems. It includes verified relevance of answer entities and marked evidence spans for different query constraints. The dataset is constructed using Wikipedia categories and human-annotated paraphrases, ensuring fluency and relevance. Evaluation shows significant room for improvement, particularly for queries with set intersection and difference, highlighting the difficulty of handling such complex queries.

    <sample id="107">In the task of cross-lingual semantic parsing, multilingual encoder-based models were used in several ways:

1. **Encoder-PTR (Pointer-based Decoder) Models**: These models, such as XLM-R + PTR and mBERT + PTR, utilized multilingual pretrained encoders combined with pointer-based decoders. They were trained on a mixture of various languages and demonstrated improved performance compared to monolingual models.

2. **Encoder-Decoder Models**: Multilingual pretrained encoder-decoder models, like mBART and mT5, were evaluated. These models showed the best performance across all nine datasets, indicating their effectiveness in handling cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.

3. **Multilingual Training**: The multilingual encoder-based models were trained on a combination of different languages, which helped improve their performance. However, it was noted that training on English could lead to a drop in performance for English itself in some cases, known as the "Curse of Multilinguality."

4. **Cross-lingual Transfer**: The models were also used for cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot transfer, where they were trained on one source language and then transferred to another language. This approach helped shorten the cross-language performance gap, especially in the few-shot setting.

Overall, multilingual encoder-based models played a crucial role in the study, demonstrating their potential and limitations in cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="108">The ACL 2023 paper by Koustav Sinha et al. revisits the minimal pair paradigm (MPP) to evaluate language models' acceptability judgments across longer context windows. Traditional MPP evaluates models by comparing acceptable and unacceptable sentences, but it doesn't account for longer sequences. The researchers address this by recreating longer sentences using data from grammaticality datasets like BLiMP and SyntaxGym, either matching or mismatching the syntactic structure. They found that models' MPP judgments are robust to arbitrary context length but significantly influenced by matching prefixes from the same dataset. This sensitivity suggests models rely on shared syntactic and semantic features, highlighting the need to adapt MPP for longer context windows to better assess their abstract knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="109">This paper introduces **Unnatural Instructions**, a dataset of natural language instructions and their corresponding inputs and outputs, created entirely through an automated process without human labor. The dataset is generated by prompting a pre-trained language model (GPT-3) with examples from the Super-Natural Instructions dataset to produce additional examples. The model generates both instructions and inputs, and further paraphrases are created to enhance diversity. The dataset contains 64,000 unique examples, expanding to 240,000 with paraphrases. The authors evaluate the dataset’s quality, finding that over 50% of the examples are correct, and even incorrect examples provide valuable information for instruction tuning. The dataset showcases creativity and diversity, including tasks like verifying scientific experiments and inventing new words, which differ from traditional NLP tasks. To assess utility, the authors fine-tune an 11 billion-parameter T5 model on Unnatural Instructions, demonstrating superior performance on benchmarks like Super-Natural Instructions, T0, BIG-Bench Hard, and LMentry compared to baselines trained on Super-Natural Instructions. The study highlights the potential of language models to generate diverse and creative data efficiently and cost-effectively, overcoming limitations of human annotation.</sample>
    <sample id="111">The authors decide what moderate-frequency words are by assuming that the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency within it. They select a trigger set, which is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval. This implies that the authors consider words with frequencies that are neither too high (common) nor too low (rare) as moderate-frequency words. The exact threshold for what constitutes "moderate frequency" is not specified in the provided content, but it is implied to be based on the frequency distribution of words in the general text corpus used for counting.</sample>
    <sample id="114">The presentation introduces a paper titled "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention" from Nanyang Technological University, presented at ACL 2023. The work addresses the heavy parameter problem in large language models (LLMs), which are transformative but suffer from high computational costs, long training times, and token-hungry requirements. The focus is on optimizing multi-head attention, a core component of LLMs, by identifying and pruning redundant heads without sacrificing performance.

The proposed approach, called **Grouped Head Attention (GHA)**, employs a **divide-and-conquer strategy** to compress multi-head attention. It consists of two stages: **group-constrained training** and the **Voting-to-Stay (VTS) algorithm**. In the first stage, attention heads are divided into groups, making intra-group heads more similar and inter-group heads more distinct. The second stage uses the VTS algorithm to prune redundant heads, retaining only one head per group, achieving significant parameter compression (up to 90%).

The model, named **GHT** (from group-constrained training) and **GHT-PS** (with VTS), was evaluated on machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization tasks. Results showed notable improvements in performance (e.g., 3.8% and 4.4% BLEU improvements in machine translation) and substantial parameter compression (e.g., 32.1% for GHT-PS). Additionally, a further efficiency analysis revealed a **LITE model** that achieved 90% parameter pruning, 62% faster inference speed, and 80% FLOP reduction while maintaining performance.

The authors highlight the potential of **task-specific automatic pruning**, inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, to further optimize LLMs for real-world applications by removing redundant parameters without performance loss. They conclude that pruning is essential to make LLMs more deployable and efficient.</sample>
    <sample id="115">The approach uses a speech segment size of lambda frames, where the decision to emit a word is based on whether the sum of cross-attention weights is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="116">In the example with Servin and Kea, the entity-specific knowledge needed is "Servin is a judge."

    <sample id="117">The most important factor between the example quality and the similarity to the source sentence is the **example quality**. According to the experimental results, the quality of the examples provided during prompting has a greater influence on the performance of large language models (LLMs) for translation than the similarity to the source sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="118">The ACL 2023 submission titled "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP" addresses the challenge of code-switching, where multilingual models like mBERT and XLM-R underperform on tasks such as sentiment analysis and question answering. The key contributions include:

1. **SwitchMLM**: A novel Masked Language Modeling (MLM) technique tailored for code-switching. It identifies switch-points (transitions between languages) as maskable tokens, focusing on these critical points rather than uniformly masking all words.

2. **FrequencyMLM**: A surrogate method for identifying switch-points when LID (Language Identification) tags are unavailable. It uses negative log likelihood from monolingual corpora to assign LID tags.

3. **Architectural Modifications**: 
   - **Residual Connections**: Added to intermediate layers of BERT to retain more switch-point information, which is better encoded in these layers than in the final layer.
   - **Auxiliary LID-based Loss**: Encourages intermediate layers to learn language-specific information, enhancing switch-point encoding.

4. **Results**: The combined method (SwitchMLM/FrequencyMLM with ResBERT and auxiliary loss) outperforms on sentiment analysis tasks across multiple language pairs.

5. **Probing Experiments**: Verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods using linear and conditional probing classifiers, showing increased switch-point information in intermediate and final layers.

In summary, the work introduces specialized MLM techniques, architectural changes, and auxiliary losses to improve multilingual models' performance on code-switched tasks, supported by experimental evidence.</sample>

2. **Position or order**: "the first one" or "the second one" for items in a list.
3. **Unique identifier**: "the one with the piano music" for a song that is easily identifiable by its musical style.

These direct references provide clear and unambiguous information, making it straightforward for the listener or the system to understand the intended entity. In contrast, indirect references require additional context or disambiguation to determine the correct entity.</sample>

    <sample id="123">Ying and Zhiyang present research on improving Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Learning through instruction tuning using the MultiInstruct dataset. They address the lack of large-scale publicly-available multi-modal instruction datasets, creating MultiInstruct, which includes 62 diverse multi-modal tasks across 10 categories, derived from 21 open-source datasets. Each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions. The unified MultiInstruct dataset processes various input and output data types in a sequence-to-sequence format, using OFA (Open Foundation for Audio-Visual) as the base model.

For evaluation, they use 53 tasks for training and reserve the common sense reasoning group for testing, with additional tasks from VQ and Miscellaneous groups. They report accuracy for multi-modal classification tasks and Rouge-L for generation tasks, along with a new metric, sensitivity, to measure consistency.

Results show that instruction tuning significantly improves OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks, with transfer learning from natural instruction datasets further enhancing performance and sensitivity. Using more instructions during fine-tuning improves overall performance and reduces sensitivity. The researchers are also working on a larger dataset with around 150 additional vision language tasks, which will be released soon.</sample>
    <sample id="124">Tan Qingyu from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba presented research on improving the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The study breaks temporal reasoning into three levels: time-to-time (e.g., "What is the year after 2010?"), time-to-event (e.g., "What team did Lionel Messi play for in 2010?"), and event-to-event (e.g., "What team did Lionel Messi play for after FC Barcelona?"). Prior work focused mainly on time-to-event reasoning, but the study aims for a more comprehensive approach.

The researchers conducted experiments using three LLMs—T5-L, FLAN-T5-L, and ChatGPT—on a preliminary year prediction task. They found that T5-L and FLAN-T5-L showed bias toward the 2000–2020 period due to pre-training data, while ChatGPT performed well on year prediction but poorly on month prediction. To address these gaps, they proposed the TempReason dataset, covering all three reasoning levels and long temporal coverage, constructed from Wikidata and Wikipedia.

The study evaluated temporal reasoning in three QA settings: Closed Book, Open Book, and Reasoning QA, where temporal knowledge is provided. They introduced a training strategy with temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning, resulting in the TempT5 model. Results showed TempT5 outperformed other models, particularly in Open Book and Reasoning QA, though some performance fluctuations across time periods persisted. The study highlights temporal reasoning biases in LLMs and proposes a benchmark and training paradigm to improve them. Future work aims to mitigate these biases.</sample>

    <sample id="126">Yes, translating the natural language query using a machine translation model before semantic parsing was considered as a baseline in the study. This approach, referred to as "Translate-Test," involved using the Google Translate API to translate the source query into the target language, and then applying a monolingual model for semantic parsing. This served as a baseline to compare against other methods, such as monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual transfer settings.</sample>
    <sample id="127">The paper "Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers" by Namgyu Ho, Laura Schmid, and Se-Young Yun introduces a method to transfer reasoning abilities from large language models (LLMs) to smaller ones, addressing the limitations of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which requires computationally expensive models like GPT-3 or PALM. The authors propose using large LLMs as "teachers" to generate step-by-step solutions to complex tasks, which are then fine-tuned into smaller "student" models. This approach allows smaller models to perform complex reasoning tasks, such as math problems or text understanding, without the need for massive computational resources.

A key innovation is **Diverse Reasoning**, where multiple reasoning samples are generated from the teacher model using stochastic temperature sampling. This technique enhances the training of the student model by exposing it to varied solutions, improving its performance. The authors evaluated their method on 12 benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, especially for text-based tasks. For example, performance on arithmetic tasks increased from 33% to 55%. The method also outperforms vanilla fine-tuning, even with small student models (0.3 billion parameters).

The authors highlight the scalability of their approach, which can be enhanced by using larger datasets, better teacher models, or bigger student models. However, this comes with trade-offs between development costs (e.g., teacher inference) and inference costs (e.g., student model size). The paper concludes that this distillation method effectively transfers reasoning abilities to small models, opening possibilities for other emergent abilities in future LLMs. The authors provide code, data, and OpenAI teacher inference results for reproducibility and encourage further research.</sample>
    <sample id="128">Akshatha and Martin present their work, "The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources," which explores how natural language understanding (NLU) models integrate knowledge from different sources. The research highlights that while models can use pretrained knowledge, they often require additional context-specific information for tasks like coreference resolution. The KITMUS test suite evaluates this integration by varying the availability of background and entity-specific knowledge across three settings: "Background-Pretrain," "Background-Both," and "Background-Inference." The study finds that models, even after task-specific training, struggle to reliably integrate background knowledge provided only at inference time. This suggests that models need tailored training to effectively combine knowledge from multiple sources. The authors emphasize that surface cues, which models often rely on, are insufficient for KITMUS tasks. Their findings indicate that improving NLU models' ability to integrate diverse knowledge sources remains a challenge, even with advanced training. The KITMUS dataset and code are available on GitHub for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="129">The authors gave the example of **black women** as a marked group in their analysis.

    <sample id="130">The paper does not explicitly state which model architectures do not generalize well. Instead, it highlights that **transformer models** generally generalize better to new data compared to other architectures. The study focuses on the importance of model architecture, size, and fine-tuning examples for good generalization, but it does not identify specific architectures that perform poorly. The key takeaway is that **non-transformer models** (e.g., traditional architectures like RNNs or CNNs) may struggle with generalization compared to transformers.</sample>

Additionally, their dataset, MultiInstruct, includes 62 diverse multi-modal tasks, further confirming their work with multiple modalities.</sample>
    <sample id="135">The content introduces **ABC-Eval**, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI developed by the Emory NLP Lab and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. Traditional evaluation methods, such as human judgments or Likert scales, provide holistic assessments but lack granularity in understanding specific aspects of dialogue quality. ABC-Eval addresses this by explicitly annotating behaviors in chat models, such as irrelevant responses, contradictions, hallucinations, and empathy. This method reduces subjectivity and provides a more precise evaluation of chat model behaviors.

The researchers compared ABC-Eval with three existing methods (Likert ratings at turn-level, dialogue-level, and pairwise comparisons) on four state-of-the-art chat models. They found that ABC-Eval labels are more reliable and predictive of overall conversation quality. For instance, ABC-Eval metrics explained over 25% of conversation quality, while Likert ratings explained far less. Additionally, ABC-Eval metrics captured unique aspects of chat quality, unlike many Likert ratings.

The study also highlighted common issues in chat models, such as common sense violations (20%), irrelevant responses (15%), and contradictions (10%). Despite advancements in the field, these challenges remain significant, emphasizing the need for reliable evaluation metrics. ABC-Eval offers a higher-resolution evaluation of conversational AI, enabling researchers to better understand and improve model performance. The authors hope ABC-Eval will contribute meaningfully to the field’s progress.</sample>
    <sample id="136">Jasivan presented a study titled "FERMAT: An Alternative to Accuracy for Numerical Reasoning," conducted with his supervisor Nafise at the University of Sheffield. The research addresses the limitations of current benchmarks in evaluating numerical reasoning capabilities of language models, which often rely on accuracy scores that are not informative about specific strengths and weaknesses. 

The motivation stems from real-world applications requiring factual correctness in numerical reasoning, such as fact-checking. An example given was the task of determining if a statement is entailed, contradicted, or neutral based on a table, which requires accurate numerical operations. The study found that larger language models perform better, but the 3-billion parameter mark is more accessible and necessary for practical applications.

FERMAT, the proposed evaluation set, focuses on number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency. It includes maths-worded questions from Illinois and CommonCore, with varied number representations (small integers, large integers, decimals) and operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The study conducted a zero-shot evaluation, finding that most models performed poorly, with the original benchmarks showing slightly better results. Fine-tuning with math teacher-generated templates improved performance across the board.

The research also highlighted the importance of language and mathematical diversity in training, with diversified templates from GSM8K and AQUA showing promising results. In conclusion, FERMAT provides a more informative alternative to existing benchmarks, emphasizing the need for number encoding, tokenization improvements, and diverse training data to enhance numerical reasoning capabilities in language models.</sample>
    <sample id="137">The paper "Tell2Design: A Dataset for Language-Guided Floor Plan Generation" by Sicong and colleagues, published in ACL 2023, introduces a novel approach to generating floor plans directly from natural language instructions. This task is distinct from traditional text-conditional image generation, which focuses on creating realistic, high-level visual concepts. Instead, it requires strict adherence to user-defined constraints and requirements, making it more suitable for practical design applications.

The researchers constructed the Tell2Design dataset, comprising 5,051 human-annotated and 76,000 artificially generated language instructions, which describe floor plan components such as room semantics, geometry, and topology. They propose a sequence-to-sequence model using a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework to tackle this task, treating language instructions as input and room bounding boxes as output. This approach allows for flexible handling of varying instruction lengths and room counts.

The model, initialized with a pre-trained T5 language model, outperforms text-conditional image generation baselines on the T2D dataset, achieving high Intersection over Union (IoU) scores. However, the model struggles with human-written instructions when trained only on artificial ones, highlighting a language distribution gap. Incorporating artificial instructions for warm-up significantly improves performance, demonstrating their mutual benefit during training.

The study underscores the challenges of generating floor plans under strict constraints and from unstructured text, and it sets a foundation for future research in language-guided design generation.</sample>

    <sample id="141">The limits of existing resources for context-dependent translation include:

1. **Limited scope**: They often rely on domain knowledge and human curation, which restricts their applicability to specific contexts and languages.
2. **Narrow focus**: They typically support only limited types of context-dependent translations, such as proper nouns or dual pronouns, and do not capture the full range of discourse phenomena that require context.
3. **Small-scale datasets**: They are based on small-scale datasets, which may not be representative of real-world translation scenarios and can lead to biased or inaccurate results.
4. **Lack of generalization**: They may not generalize well across different languages and domains, as they are often tailored to specific language pairs or contexts.
5. **Inadequate evaluation metrics**: Existing evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, may not accurately capture the importance of context in translation, leading to an incomplete assessment of model performance.

These limitations highlight the need for more comprehensive and data-driven approaches to evaluating and improving context-dependent translation.</sample>

    <sample id="146">The talk discusses the challenges and solutions in addressing the omission problem in dialogue summarization, a critical issue in text summarization. Dialogue summarization involves creating concise summaries of conversational data, but current state-of-the-art models still produce summaries with significant omissions, affecting their quality. The speaker highlights that omission is a pervasive issue, with about 70% of summaries from various domains and models containing omitted information. Omissions are randomly distributed across dialogue positions, indicating the unstructured nature of dialogues and the difficulty in identifying key information.

To tackle this, the speaker introduces the OLDS dataset, a high-quality dataset for omission detection in dialogue summarization. Built on five existing benchmarks across five domains, the dataset uses diverse candidate summaries generated by different models and an automatic method to label omissions. Human evaluation ensures label quality. The speaker then explores three baseline frameworks for omission detection: pair-wise classification, sequence labeling, and pointer networks. Evaluation metrics include Precision, Recall, F1-score, and a word-level omission recall (WR score). Results show that the task is challenging, with F1-scores around 50%, but the inclusion of omission information in summary refinement significantly improves performance, suggesting that omission detection is a valuable and promising direction for enhancing dialogue summarization quality.</sample>

    <sample id="150">Archiki presented the ACL paper "MEETINGQA: Extractive Question-Answering on Meeting Transcripts," highlighting the potential of meeting transcripts as a rich and underutilized domain for NLP research. The team introduced the MeetingQA dataset, which focuses on extractive question-answering based on questions and answers from meeting transcripts. This dataset addresses the gap in prior works that primarily focused on summarization and action item extraction, emphasizing the QA component in meetings.

The MeetingQA dataset, derived from the AMI corpus, contains 7.7K questions and answers, with 30% unanswerable, 40% multispan answers, and 48% multi-speaker answers. Questions are often longer, open-ended, and seek discussions, while answers can span multiple speakers and sentences. The dataset also includes rhetorical questions and disagreements in multi-speaker answers.

The team explored various models and methods, including context-retrieval, single-span and multi-span models, and data augmentation using silver annotations from the MediaSum dataset. Results showed a significant gap between human performance and fine-tuned models, with short-context models like RoBERTa outperforming long-context models like Longformer. Zero-shot performance was lower, with a 50 F1 point gap compared to human performance, but silver data augmentation improved results. Larger instruction-tuned models like FLAN-T5 performed comparably to other models.

Error analysis revealed challenges in identifying rhetorical questions and speaker-specific answers, particularly in the zero-shot setting. Overall, MeetingQA highlights the complexity of QA in meeting transcripts and the need for further research in this domain.</sample>
    <sample id="152">Frederick Riemenschneider presented a groundbreaking project at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classical philology, focusing on developing advanced language models for Ancient Greek and Latin. The team created new models, including monolingual (GreBERTa and GreTa) and multilingual (PhilBERTa and PhilTa) versions, tailored for classical texts. These models were trained on high-quality datasets, including a newly developed corpus from the Internet Archive, which overcame OCR limitations by identifying Greek texts through stop words. The models were benchmarked on tasks like part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and lemmatization, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models for both languages. Notably, the encoder-decoder model GreTa demonstrated superior lemmatization performance, improving accuracy by 5 percentage points for Ancient Greek. The team also explored the implications of multilinguality but found that monolingual models performed similarly to multilingual ones in semantic and world knowledge tasks. The project highlights the potential of NLP to enhance classical philology, offering tools for text processing, analysis, and understanding of ancient languages. The research underscores the importance of tailored models and high-quality datasets to unlock the full potential of NLP in humanities research.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Ninareh Mehrabi, a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Alexa AI's Responsible AI team, presented research on resolving ambiguities in text-to-image generative models. The study addresses the challenges posed by ambiguous prompts, such as "The girl enters the room with flowers," which can be interpreted in multiple ways. To mitigate these ambiguities, the team developed a framework that includes a benchmark dataset (modified from LAVA) and two disambiguation methods. 

The first method involves a language model generating clarifying questions based on the ambiguous prompt, which the user then answers. The second method has the language model generate different visual interpretations, allowing the user to choose the one that aligns with their intention. The disambiguated prompts are then used to generate images via text-to-image models, which are evaluated for faithfulness to the user's intention using a VQA model.

The research demonstrates that resolving ambiguities improves the faithfulness of generated images to user intentions. The automatic evaluation framework aligns with human evaluations, making it a reliable tool for assessing text-to-image models. The study highlights disparities in resolving different types of ambiguities and shows the overall positive impact of the proposed framework on faithful generation. This work contributes to enhancing the reliability and user satisfaction of text-to-image generative models.</sample>

    <sample id="157">The paper "Dialogue Summarization with Static-Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph" by Shen Gao et al. addresses the challenge of distilling key information from multi-participant dialogues into concise summaries. Existing methods rely on pre-computed static graph structures, which are prone to errors from external linguistic tools and fail to adapt dynamically to the dialogue context. The proposed SDDS model overcomes these limitations by integrating both static and dynamic graph structures.

The model first encodes utterances into vector representations using an Utterance Encoder. It then constructs a static graph using heuristic methods like Discourse Parsing Graph, Key Co-occurrence (KeyCo-occ), speaker relationship modeling, and utterance position graph. These static graphs capture dialogue structure information. A Static-Dynamic Graph module combines these static graphs and uses a dynamic graph module to learn semantic relationships between utterances based on their vector representations. A multi-head attention model is employed for this dynamic graph construction, avoiding pre-computed methods.

Finally, a pre-trained language model acts as the Summary Generator, fusing the static and dynamic graph representations into a coherent summary. The model uses a dual cross-attention mechanism, incorporating graph attention alongside self-attention, to integrate dialogue structure information during summarization.

The SDDS model enhances dialogue summarization by dynamically adapting to the context and reducing reliance on external tools, improving accuracy and flexibility. The code and data are available on GitHub for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="158">The talk by Qipeng Guo from AWS focuses on "Dual Cache for Long Document Neural Coreference Resolution," a method addressing the challenges of coreference resolution in long documents. Coreference resolution aims to identify and link mentions of entities across a text. Traditional methods face quadratic complexity, while cache-based methods reduce this to linear complexity by using a fixed-size cache. However, in long documents with frequent topic shifts, the Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy in single caches leads to high cache misses, especially for high-frequency entities.

To address this, the proposed Dual Cache introduces a local cache for entities mentioned in the immediate context (with LRU eviction) and a global cache for high-frequency entities (with Least Frequently Used, LFU eviction). The model processes the document left-to-right, classifying mentions as new or existing in the cache, and evaluates their frequency. Qualified entities are added to the global cache, while others go to the local cache. When caches are full, eviction policies are triggered.

Evaluations on public benchmarks (LitBank, OntoNotes, and WikiCoref) show that Dual Cache outperforms single cache methods, even with unbounded memory. Without training data, single cache methods with unbounded memory perform slightly better, but Dual Cache remains faster. In a 30,000-word book-level document, the performance gap between Dual Cache and baselines is significant. Dual Cache also reduces cache misses more effectively than a single cache. Finally, Dual Cache offers the best performance/cost ratio, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. In summary, Dual Cache improves coreference resolution in long documents by leveraging a dual cache system, outperforming single cache methods, and being the most cost-effective solution.</sample>

    <sample id="164">The primary benefit of weakly supervised learning (WSL) is the ability to train neural networks on noisy, low-quality, or weakly labeled data, which is often much cheaper and more accessible than clean, manually annotated data. This allows for the use of diverse and abundant data sources, such as heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or crowdsourced annotations, to train models that can generalize well to clean, unseen data. By leveraging these weaker labeling sources, WSL aims to reduce the reliance on expensive and time-consuming manual annotations, making the training process more efficient and scalable. However, the study highlights that WSL methods often require clean validation samples to function effectively, which introduces additional annotation costs and challenges the initial assumption of complete avoidance of manual labeling.</sample>
    <sample id="165">Wenting Zhao, a PhD student at Cornell University, presents a paper titled "Abductive Commonsense Reasoning Exploiting Mutually Exclusive Explanations." The paper addresses the challenge of abductive reasoning, which involves identifying a plausible explanation that bridges the gap between a context and an outcome. Zhao introduces an unsupervised learning method called LiPoR (Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization) that learns abductive reasoning without requiring annotated, potentially noisy, and subjective explanations.

In LiPoR, explanations are treated as latent variables, and the objective is to maximize the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context. To ensure plausible explanations are preferred, the method incorporates a regularizer that exploits the mutual exclusivity of explanations. This regularizer, denoted by Omega, compares the entropy of the probability distribution over explanations to the log of the number of plausible explanations, favoring a subset of explanations when the entropy is minimized.

Zhao demonstrates LiPoR's effectiveness on the AlphaNLI dataset, outperforming zero-shot models, including the strong GPT-3 baseline, by over 4 absolute points in accuracy. This approach provides a promising unsupervised method for abductive reasoning, leveraging mutual exclusivity to improve plausibility without supervision. The paper is available at tinyurl.com/zhao-lipor.</sample>
    <sample id="166">Yunxin from Harbin Institute of Technology introduces a new framework, "A Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Framework for Image Retrieval from Linguistically Complex Text." This framework addresses the challenge of image retrieval from complex text descriptions, where typical visual language models struggle due to the complexity and similarity of images. Inspired by the Divide-and-Conquer strategy and Dual-Process Theory, the framework combines analogical reasoning (System 1) and logical reasoning (System 2). The first module, the Proposition Generator, simplifies complex text into manageable propositions. The Visual-Linguistic Interactor (System 1) interacts with visual and propositional information to generate matching scores and reasoning states. The Neural-Symbolic Reasoner (System 2) integrates these states to produce the final solution. Experimental results show that the NDCR framework outperforms baselines, and ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of each module. The framework's interoperability is demonstrated through detailed inference states and results. The authors suggest that neural symbolic calculation and integrating Dual-Process Theory with Divide-and-Conquer could further enhance complex reasoning and planning in large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="167">In the DEPLAIN-web corpus, the documents were aligned using a combination of manual and automatic alignment methods. Specifically, the 750 documents were aligned with manual alignment for some of the pairs, while the rest were aligned using automatic methods. This resulted in a total of 30,450 sentence pairs for the DEPLAIN-web corpus. The exact allocation between manual and automatic alignment methods is not specified in the provided content, but it is clear that both methods were employed to ensure the quality and accuracy of the alignments.</sample>

    <sample id="169">The paper "Prompting PaLM for Translation: Assessing Strategies and Performance" explores the use of PaLM, a 540 billion-parameter language model, for machine translation tasks. PaLM, trained on 780 billion tokens, was previously state-of-the-art in hundreds of NLP tasks. This study systematically evaluates prompting strategies for translation, comparing PaLM to state-of-the-art systems using WMT test sets and metrics. The research highlights the significant impact of prompting on translation performance, with experiments showing that different prompts can lead to BLEURT point differences, in extreme cases up to 40 points. A 5-shot prompting strategy, where source sentences are marked with their language, was found effective, though example quality is more critical than similarity to the source. High-quality examples, particularly from curated data like WMT dev sets, improve performance. While PaLM performs close to commercial systems like Google Translate, it still lags behind specialized state-of-the-art systems, particularly in accuracy, often omitting parts of the source sentence for fluency. Human evaluations using the MQM framework confirm PaLM's fluency is comparable but highlight accuracy issues, particularly in omission errors. The study concludes that selecting high-quality examples and understanding prompting strategies are crucial for leveraging LLMs in translation tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="171">The existing works on watermarking for embedding as services can be broadly classified into four categories:

1. **Text-based watermarking**: This method embeds a watermark directly into the text data before it is fed into the embedding model. However, it is not applicable to embedding as services because the watermark is visible to users and can be easily removed.

2. **Image-based watermarking**: This method embeds a watermark into the image data before it is fed into the embedding model. Similar to text-based watermarking, it is not applicable to embedding as services because the watermark is visible to users and can be easily removed.

3. **Data-based watermarking**: This method embeds a watermark into the data distribution before it is fed into the embedding model. However, it lacks transferability, meaning that the watermark cannot be detected in the attacker's model after extraction.

4. **Model-based watermarking**: This method embeds a watermark into the model parameters during training. While it has some transferability, it is not applicable to embedding as services because it requires access to the model parameters, which are typically not available in such services.

These existing works either lack applicability to embedding as services or fail to ensure transferability, making them insufficient for protecting the copyright of embedding as services.</sample>
    <sample id="172">No, multilingual LLMs such as Codex and BLOOM are not sufficient for Cross-Lingual Semantic Parsing (CLSP) tasks. According to the study presented, these models still fall short in performance compared to other models, particularly in the context of cross-lingual semantic parsing. The study found that Encoder-Decoder models outperform previous work and achieve comparable results, and that pretraining on English natural language can significantly boost the performance of Few-shot on target natural languages. Therefore, while Codex and BLOOM may have some capabilities in CLSP, they are not yet adequate for the task.</sample>
    <sample id="174">**Abstract:**  
The paper "ArgAnalysis35K: A large-scale dataset for Argument Quality Analysis" introduces a novel dataset addressing the limitations of existing datasets in the field. ArgAnalysis35K stands out for its scale (35,000 argument-analysis pairs), high-quality arguments sourced from expert debaters, parliamentary speeches, and diverse themes (24), rather than relying solely on crowdsourcing or pre-selected motions. Unlike traditional datasets, it captures the nuanced structure of arguments by introducing the concept of "analysis," which combines claims, premises, and reasoning to explain the argument’s coherence and persuasiveness. This innovation enhances the dataset’s utility for NLP tasks by providing a more comprehensive representation of arguments. Additionally, the dataset incorporates an instance-based annotator reliability model, which mitigates human biases by retaining annotations even when annotators may have personal opinions on specific topics. Finally, a relevance model assigns scores to arguments based on their applicability to various themes, capturing the versatility of arguments across different contexts. ArgAnalysis35K thus offers a more diverse, reliable, and contextually relevant dataset for advancing argument quality analysis research.</sample>
    <sample id="175">The method deals with the ambiguity of permutations by inducing the alignment as part of the training process. Since the alignment between input and output tokens is not provided in the training data, the model must learn which multiset each input token belongs to. This is achieved by treating the permutation problem as a continuous relaxation, which approximates the NP-hard problem of finding the highest-scoring permutation. This relaxation allows for backpropagation through the solution, enabling the model to learn linguistically more plausible permutations during training. By doing so, the method effectively handles the ambiguity of permutations and improves the generalization to deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="176">The fairness of a downstream NLP model is defined by its ability to perform tasks without amplifying or introducing biases that could lead to unfair outcomes. In the context of the presentation, fairness is evaluated by examining how different language models with varying political leanings perform on tasks like hate speech detection and fake news detection. Specifically:

1. **Performance Across Demographics or Political Leaning**: Left-leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups but worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups, and vice versa for right-leaning models. Similarly, left-leaning models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning, and vice versa.

2. **Impact on Marginalized Groups**: If a model with a particular political leaning is deployed, it could marginalize people with opposite political opinions and fail to adequately detect hate speech or misinformation targeting minority groups, leading to unfair outcomes.

Thus, fairness is ensured when a model performs consistently and equitably across different social and political categories, without disproportionately affecting certain groups or ideologies.</sample>

    <sample id="179">Melanie Sclar discusses the development of **SymbolicToM**, a method to enhance **Theory of Mind (ToM)** reasoning in large language models (LLMs). ToM involves understanding and reasoning about the mental states of others, a skill LLMs like ChatGPT struggle with, particularly in false-belief tasks. SymbolicToM addresses this by using **graphical representations** to explicitly model characters' beliefs and mental states, enabling LLMs to reason more effectively. These graphs, such as **BBob** (Bob's belief) and **BBob,Alice** (Bob's belief about Alice), are computed during inference using off-the-shelf models like NLI and OpenIE. This approach allows LLMs to answer complex questions, such as "Where does Alice think Bob will search for the apple?" by recursively querying the graphs.

Experiments show that SymbolicToM significantly improves performance on the **ToMi dataset** and outperforms supervised baselines like fine-tuned GPT-3 and Textual Time Travel. It also demonstrates robustness in out-of-domain scenarios, such as story structure and linguistic generalization, with notable gains in datasets like **D₁** and **ParaphrasedToMi**. SymbolicToM avoids overfitting risks, provides interpretable reasoning, and enhances LLMs' ability to understand diverse and complex narratives. Overall, it is a plug-and-play method that improves ToM reasoning in LLMs, making them more capable of handling nuanced tasks. For detailed results, refer to the paper.</sample>

    <sample id="181">This paper addresses the challenge of constrained language planning, where large language models (LLMs) generate step-by-step scripts for specific goals with multi-faceted constraints. Unlike previous work focusing on abstract goals, this study explores planning for concrete goals, such as "make a chocolate cake," which introduces additional constraints. The authors evaluate LLMs' performance on specific goals, finding unsatisfactory results due to semantic incompleteness and lack of constraint faithfulness. To address these issues, they propose an "over-generate-then-filter" method: LLMs generate multiple scripts for specific goals, and a filter model selects the most faithful ones based on semantic similarity and constraint keywords. This approach significantly improves script quality.

To enable constrained language planning with smaller models, the authors distill a dataset of constrained scripts, CoScript, from LLMs. CoScript contains 55,000 specific goals with scripts, validated for quality. Experiments show that a smaller model, T5, fine-tuned on CoScript, outperforms most LLMs, demonstrating that specialized models can achieve superior results with appropriate datasets. The CoScript dataset is proposed as a valuable resource for advancing research in constrained language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="183">The authors created the human-written portrayals of target groups by drawing inspiration from a study where human subjects were given prompts similar to those used for generating personas in the LLMs. These prompts asked participants to imagine and describe themselves as members of specific demographic groups, such as an Asian woman or a Middle-Eastern woman. This approach allowed for a direct comparison between the generated personas from LLMs and the human-written responses, helping to surface racial stereotypes in a more generalized and comparable manner.</sample>

    <sample id="188">Iterative transfer learning is a method where a model is fine-tuned iteratively on different tasks or datasets to improve its performance. In the context of the paper, it involves fine-tuning the model first on closely related tasks (such as CE tasks) and then further fine-tuning on another task (like debate) to enhance the model's zero-shot performance on the target task (dissonance detection). This iterative process helps the model learn more effectively from the related tasks, improving its ability to detect cognitive dissonance in language.</sample>

It focuses on capturing the natural language users employ when they need to choose between entities (e.g., songs, books, recipes) without directly naming them. The dataset aims to benchmark LLMs' ability to disambiguate entities based on indirect references, such as "the newer one" or "the one without words," and to provide a larger-scale, public resource for this task.</sample>
    <sample id="190">An attacker can extract model parameters through an Embedding as a Service (EaaS) by leveraging the embeddings provided by the service. Here's a brief explanation of the process:

1. **Embedding Collection**: The attacker collects a large number of embeddings from the EaaS by querying the service with various input sentences. Since the embeddings are publicly available, the attacker can gather them without needing access to the underlying model.

2. **Target Model Training**: Using the collected embeddings, the attacker trains a target model (often a smaller, more efficient model) to mimic the behavior of the original EaaS model. This is typically done using techniques like transfer learning or fine-tuning.

3. **Model Extraction**: The attacker's target model learns to generate embeddings that are similar to those produced by the original EaaS model. Over time, the target model can approximate the parameters of the original model, effectively extracting its key features and characteristics.

4. **Service Replication**: Once the target model is trained, the attacker can use it to provide similar embedding services, potentially infringing on the original provider's copyright and intellectual property.

This process highlights the importance of watermarking techniques like the **Embedding Marker** proposed in the paper, which embeds a covert watermark in the embeddings to detect and prevent unauthorized extraction and replication of the model.</sample>

    <sample id="192">Yang Luo presented "CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization," addressing the challenge of balancing fast convergence and low memory usage in training large language models. Traditional adaptive optimizers like Adam require significant memory for gradient estimates, while memory-efficient methods like Adafactor sacrifice performance. CAME tackles this by introducing a confidence-guided approach to adaptive updating, inspired by addressing erroneous updates in Adafactor. It uses the residual between predicted and generated updates to adaptively adjust the optimization step, reducing instability.

Experiments on BookCorpus, English Wikipedia, and models like BERT, GPT-2, and T5 demonstrated CAME's effectiveness. Compared to Adafactor, CAME improved validation accuracy by 3.4% with the same training steps. It outperformed Adam in large-scale pre-training and reduced memory usage significantly, even with batch sizes ranging from 8K to 32K. CAME also showed comparable performance to Adam on BERT-based downstream tasks with lower memory costs. Additionally, it excelled in large batch training, a critical improvement over existing memory-efficient optimizers. Overall, CAME achieves both fast convergence and memory efficiency, making it a robust solution for large language model training.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The paper introduces "Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree" (RoHT), a novel framework for explainable question answering (XQA) that addresses the limitations of existing methods. RoHT integrates knowledge from both structured knowledge bases (KBs) and free-text corpora by decomposing complex questions into a hierarchical structure called the Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT). This approach allows for flexible selection of appropriate knowledge sources at different levels of question decomposition.

The framework operates in two stages: first, it builds the HQDT by decomposing a complex question into atomic sub-questions using a question decomposer and a generator. Each node in the tree is assigned a certainty score based on the likelihood of its generation. Second, probabilistic reasoning is applied over the HQDT to fuse knowledge from KBs and text corpora, considering the probability scores of both string generation and answering. The reasoning process is recursive, involving a scheduler that selects knowledge sources, executors that retrieve answers, and an aggregator that combines and outputs the top answers.

RoHT is evaluated on two datasets: KQA Pro (with incomplete KB and Wikipedia as a supplementary corpus) and Musique (with given text paragraphs and Wikidata as a supplementary KB). Results show that RoHT outperforms existing methods by integrating answers from sub-questions of different levels and leveraging both KB and text knowledge. The framework demonstrates significant improvements in both KB-only and mixed KB-text scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical question decomposition and probabilistic reasoning in XQA.</sample>

    <sample id="198">We need to evaluate the models' acceptability throughout the context window because large language models are increasingly capable of processing longer and longer sequences. Current minimal pair paradigm (MPP) pipelines, which typically evaluate models on short, single-sentence inputs, may not fully capture the models' abstract knowledge and acceptability judgments across the entire context window. By extending the MPP to longer sequences, we can better understand how models handle acceptability in varying contexts, which is crucial for assessing their robustness and generalization capabilities.</sample>
    <sample id="199">No, training in a multilingual fashion did not cause a performance drop compared to monolingual English models.

The study evaluated over 20 models on both the CoNLL-2003 and CoNLL++ datasets, and the performance drop was observed across various NER tasks. The main cause of the performance regression was identified as temporal drift, where the increasing gap between the training and testing data (in terms of time) led to a degradation in performance. This suggests that the regression in generalization is a broad issue affecting NER tasks in general, rather than being specific to certain types of named entities.</sample>
    <sample id="203">Positionality in NLP matters because it highlights the systematic biases that can arise when datasets and models are developed without considering the diverse perspectives and experiences of different populations. This bias can lead to unequal performance and fairness issues, where certain groups (e.g., non-English speakers, individuals with different educational backgrounds, or non-binary individuals) are disproportionately affected. By acknowledging and addressing positionality, NLP researchers can ensure that their work is more inclusive, equitable, and aligned with the needs of a broader audience. This is crucial as NLP tasks increasingly involve subjective and socially oriented domains, where fairness and representation are paramount.</sample>
    <sample id="204">The multilingual LLMs like BLOOM were not explicitly mentioned to be fine-tuned with adapters or full fine-tuning in the presentation.

    <sample id="205">Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, presented research on the political biases in language models (LMs) and their downstream applications. The study investigates how LMs, trained on large-scale web data including politically diverse news sources, develop political leanings that can propagate to downstream tasks, leading to fairness issues. Key findings include:

1. **Political Leanings of LMs**: LMs like GPT-4 exhibit varying political orientations, occupying all quadrants of the political spectrum. GPT models are generally more liberal than BART variants.

2. **Bias from Training Data**: Controlled experiments showed that further training on partisan corpora (e.g., left-leaning Reddit) shifts the LM’s ideological coordinates. This indicates that political biases are influenced by the pretraining data.

3. **Polarization in LMs**: LMs trained on data from before and after 2017 (the 45th U.S. president’s election) show increased polarization, suggesting they can capture societal trends.

4. **Downstream Task Performance**: LMs with different political leanings perform differently on tasks like hate speech and fake news detection. For example, left-leaning LMs are better at detecting hate speech against minority groups but worse against powerful groups, and vice versa.

5. **Fairness Implications**: Deploying biased LMs in real-world applications (e.g., social media moderation) could marginalize certain groups and exacerbate societal divides.

The research highlights the dilemma of balancing political neutrality in LMs without resorting to censorship. It underscores the urgent need to address political biases to ensure fairness in NLP applications.</sample>

Instead, it emphasizes qualitative improvements and the ability to generate higher-quality scripts.

    <sample id="215">The talk by Adam Przepiórkowski discusses the dependency structure of coordination, focusing on the debate between asymmetric and symmetric approaches. Asymmetric theories, such as Universal Dependencies and Mel'čuk's meaning text theory, treat the first conjunct as the head of the coordinate structure. In contrast, the Prague approach and multi-headed approaches, like Hudson's Word Grammar, view the conjunction or all conjuncts as heads. The paper argues for symmetric structures based on the principle of dependency length minimization, which favors shorter dependencies. This principle explains why sentences like "Marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees yesterday" are acceptable, as they reduce the total dependency length compared to an alternative structure. Statistical analysis from the Penn Treebank confirms that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, especially when the governor is on the left or absent. This tendency disappears when the governor is on the right, supporting the argument for symmetric coordination structures over asymmetric ones. The paper provides a novel argument against asymmetric approaches and in favor of symmetric structures, which can be further discussed at the poster session.</sample>
    <sample id="217">The research paper "Seen to Unseen: Exploring Compositional Generalization of Multi-Attribute Controllable Dialogue Generation" by Weihao Zeng, Lulu Zhao, and Keqing He addresses the challenge of generating controllable dialogues with multiple attributes. The authors highlight that existing methods focus on single attributes or combine controllers from single attributes with specific labels, but lack the ability to handle continuous attributes and are limited by annotated data.

The proposed solution, Disentangled Controllable Generation (DCG), learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses disentanglement loss to separate different attribute combinations. A unified reference-free evaluation framework, Multi-Attribute Evaluation (MAE), is introduced to assess different granularities of attributes without requiring additional labeled data.

The model is based on the DialoGPT framework with a compositional prompt module. Two types of prompts are designed: attribute-oriented prompts, which use controllable attribute values as prompts, and task-oriented prompts, which guide the model with instance-independent global features. These prompts are concatenated to create whole prompt embeddings.

To improve generation ability and diversity, pseudo combinations are added, and a disentanglement loss is introduced to train multiple compositional prompts. The MAE framework includes a template with discrete prompts and a trainable continuous dialogue-oriented prompt to improve stability and robustness.

Experiments show that DCG outperforms baselines in attribute controllability and text equality, and the proposed method successfully generalizes from seen attributes to unseen combinations. The MAE framework correlates well with human judgments and outperforms classic metrics for both discrete and continuous attributes. The visualization of concatenated prompt embeddings demonstrates the disentanglement of attribute combinations and the ability to learn relations between different attributes. The attribute-oriented prompt method outperforms models with independent prompts for each attribute value, as it learns attribute concepts from seen values to unseen combinations.</sample>

    <sample id="219">The presentation by Jia-Huei Ju focuses on "A Compare-and-contrast Multistage Pipeline for Uncovering Financial Signals in Financial Reports," a research project conducted with collaborators and advisors at Academia Sinica. The work aims to streamline the extraction of valuable financial insights from annual reports, specifically Form 10-K documents filed with the SEC. These reports, while detailed, require significant manual effort to extract meaningful information. The research is motivated by observations that financial reports exhibit high text similarity across years (e.g., 80% token overlap) and yearly dependency.

The team introduces a highlighting task that compares and contrasts the content of a target report with its previous year's report (reference). The goal is to identify and rank words that highlight changes or important financial signals. The proposed pipeline consists of four stages: document segmentation (not detailed), relation recognition, out-of-domain fine-tuning, and in-domain fine-tuning.

For relation recognition, pairs of segments are classified into three types: β (high similarity), revised (similar syntax but different meaning), and unmatched (new information). The model is fine-tuned using the eSNLI dataset for out-of-domain adaptation and revised pairs for in-domain adaptation. Pseudo-labels are used for fine-tuning, and soft labeling techniques are employed to improve label quality.

The evaluation, using the eSNLI dataset and the FINAL dataset, shows that the domain-adaptive highlighting model outperforms other approaches, maintaining generalization capability. The model also performs well on unmatched pairs, demonstrating its potential for uncovering new financial signals. The research opens avenues for further improvements and applications in financial analysis.</sample>

The research explores zero-shot and few-shot methods to generate interventions. Few-shot methods use examples from target domains to prompt large language models, improving retriever performance by 8% and reader performance by 11% on average. Zero-shot techniques aim to control question, answer, and context interactions without target domain examples, showing mixed results. 

The study also analyzes dataset shifts: no shift (compatibility), concept shift (retriever struggles, reader uses wrong reasoning), covariate shift (retriever struggles, reader uses correct reasoning), and full shift (both retriever and reader incompatible). Compatibility is measured using likelihood scores for contexts and answers. 

Finally, the research identifies that few-shot adaptations work best for datasets with concept and covariate shifts, while zero-shot adaptations are effective for datasets with full shifts. Overall, data interventions improve reader performance by up to 24%, demonstrating that tailored approaches are crucial for domain adaptation in open-domain QA.</sample>

    <sample id="227">The audio discusses the limitations of current language models in achieving **grounded language understanding**, which involves mapping natural language expressions to executable plans or programs in specific environments. Challenges arise because these models are primarily pre-trained on textual data without grounding, creating a gap between pre-training and downstream applications. The proposed solution, **Pangu**, separates the symbolic world (environment interaction) from the linguistic world (language model scoring), focusing the model on **discrimination** rather than generation. This approach leverages a symbolic agent to propose candidate plans, which the language model then ranks. Pangu achieves outstanding performance across various settings, including knowledge-based question answering, with strong sample efficiency. It outperforms baseline models like ArcaneQA and demonstrates robustness under non-i.i.d. settings. The key takeaway is that **discrimination, not generation, is a more effective strategy for grounded language understanding**. The framework is generic and applicable to diverse tasks, with a focus on practical applications like smart assistants, semantic search, and robotic control. The authors invite discussions and collaborations to further refine the approach.</sample>

    <sample id="229">Gabriella Skitalinskaya and Henning Wachsmuth present their joint work on detecting improvable claims in argumentative writing. The paper focuses on the importance of text revision in achieving optimal phrasing, particularly in argumentative texts, where effective communication is crucial. They introduce two tasks: Suboptimal-Claim detection (determining if a claim needs revision) and Claim Improvement Suggestion (identifying quality issues to improve a claim). The authors explore challenges in using revision-based data, such as representativity, reliability, model complexity, contextual dependency, and topical/user bias. They analyze these challenges in the context of argumentative text, specifically using data from collaborative online debate platforms like Kialo. The study highlights the benefits of modeling the distance between claim versions for detecting suboptimal claims and emphasizes the importance of contextual information in assessing text quality. The authors conclude that revision-based data can be effectively used for the introduced tasks, and contextual information plays a role in claim assessment, depending on the task and quality issues. For detailed findings and strategies, the authors invite readers to refer to their paper.</sample>

    <sample id="233">The paper "Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation" by Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi addresses the challenges of simultaneous speech translation (SimulST), which involves real-time translation of spoken language. Current SimulST models often require specialized architectures, lengthy training, and multiple models for different latency regimes. The proposed solution, EDAtt (Encoder-Decoder Attention), leverages existing offline speech translation (ST) models without retraining. It uses a single model for all latency regimes, managing latency through specific parameters and utilizing the attention mechanism to guide translation. EDAtt decides whether to emit a partial translation based on attention weights, emitting words only when attention is not concentrated on the last lambda speech frames. This approach outperforms other strategies like Wait-k and Local Agreement, and is the fastest in terms of computational-aware latency. The authors have released open-source code and models to facilitate reproducibility.</sample>
    <sample id="234">The prompting strategy significantly impacts the performance of large language models (LLMs) like PaLM for translation tasks. In the study, it was observed that the difference in translation quality, measured by BLEURT points, could vary by more than one point due to different prompting strategies. In extreme cases, the difference could be as high as 40 BLEURT points. The research concluded that the quality of the examples provided in the prompt is more important than the similarity to the source sentence, especially for prompting strategies like five-shot prompting. Therefore, selecting a good prompting strategy, particularly the quality of the examples, is crucial for achieving optimal translation results with LLMs.</sample>

    <sample id="236">The 5 expert-written instructions for each task in the MultiInstruct dataset are not explicitly listed in the provided content. However, based on the context, these instructions are designed to guide the model in performing the multi-modal tasks effectively. They likely include variations of natural language instructions tailored to the specific multi-modal task, ensuring the model can generalize and perform well across diverse tasks. For example, instructions might include:

1. **Task-specific guidance**: Providing clear instructions on what the model should do (e.g., "Classify the image based on the text description").
2. **Output format**: Specifying the expected output format (e.g., "Generate a caption for the image in 5 sentences").
3. **Contextual details**: Including additional context or constraints (e.g., "Focus on the main object in the image").
4. **Variation in wording**: Using different phrasings to test the model's flexibility (e.g., "Describe the scene in the image" vs. "Explain what is happening in the image").
5. **Evaluation criteria**: Highlighting key aspects for the model to focus on (e.g., "Ensure the generated text is coherent and relevant to the image").

These instructions are crucial for evaluating the model's ability to generalize across tasks and handle variations in input and output.</sample>
    <sample id="237">The authors propose to test the models on a diagnostic test suite called the **KITMUS Test** (Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources Test). This test evaluates the ability of models to integrate and use knowledge from different sources, such as pretrained knowledge and inference-time knowledge. Specifically, they designed a **coreference resolution task** to probe how well models can draw on both entity-specific and background knowledge available in different sources. The KITMUS test includes three settings: **Background-Pretrain**, **Background-Both**, and **Background-Inference**, which vary the availability of these knowledge types. This allows the authors to assess how effectively models can integrate knowledge from multiple sources, especially when background knowledge is only available at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="238">The MeetingBank dataset, developed by Yebowen Hu from the University of Central Florida, is a benchmark dataset designed to advance meeting summarization technologies. It focuses on City Council meetings, addressing the challenge of creating high-quality summaries and sourcing reliable meeting transcripts. The dataset includes 1,366 meetings and nearly 7,000 instances, featuring transcripts, reference summaries, and URLs to additional resources. Data collection involved converting audio to text using Speechmatics API and aligning timestamps with summaries.

The dataset provides statistics on meeting duration, token counts, speakers, and summarization instances per city. It measures abstraction levels using coverage (percentage of summary words in transcripts) and density (summary references extracted from the text). Analysis shows that most summaries (70-90% coverage) are verbatim, with Seattle and Boston showing higher editing levels.

Evaluations were conducted on top summarization systems, including extractive models (Oracle, LEAD, LexRank, TextRank) and abstractive models (BART-Large, Pagasus, Longformer, DialogLM, HMNet). GPT-3, despite poor automatic metrics, excelled in fluency and coherence in human evaluations. Human annotators assessed summaries on informativeness, factuality, fluency, coherence, and redundancy, with GPT-3 achieving the highest overall scores.

The dataset aims to improve meeting summarization by focusing on key discussion points and developing better evaluation metrics. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and provides insights into City Council decision-making processes. Users are encouraged to download and explore the dataset for further advancements in the field.</sample>

The research addresses two key issues in automated misinformation detection: unrealistic evaluation and lack of human-centricity. The proposed framework integrates human feedback throughout the process, from raw tweet analysis to actionable outputs, aiming for a more realistic and effective system. The system consists of two components: (1) detecting misleading claims using keyword filtering and a T5 model for claim extraction, ranked by trendiness, and (2) verifying policy violations using a BERT-based stance classification model. The evaluation focuses on early detection of unapproved treatments before news debunking, achieving 65% accuracy in policy violation detection and 124.2 violations confirmed per human hour. The framework aims to motivate the development of future human-in-the-loop systems and provides an industry perspective on misinformation detection.</sample>

    <sample id="245">The presentation, "A Needle in a Haystack: An Analysis of High-Agreement Workers on MTurk for Summarization," focuses on developing a pipeline to identify high-performing annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for summarization tasks. The pipeline consists of two qualification stages: a "Qualification Task" and an "Endurance Task." The Qualification Task evaluates workers' ability to assess multiple dimensions of summaries, categorizing them into gold, silver, bronze, or blocked. Only gold and silver workers proceed to the Endurance Task, which tests their capacity to handle heavy workloads. After these stages, 12 workers (4 gold and 8 silver) are selected, achieving high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and outperforming experts in some cases.

The Reference-based Task further assesses workers' performance on the actual annotation task, with Pipeline workers showing strong results. The Baseline and CloudResearch MTurk workers are also compared, with Pipeline and CloudResearch achieving similar Krippendorff's Alpha scores but Pipeline being more cost-effective. The analysis of correctness across annotation sources reveals significant correlations between Pipeline and CloudResearch workers, as well as between real GPT models and expert judgments.

In conclusion, the pipeline effectively filters high-quality workers, achieving high agreement at a lower cost and similar quality to CloudResearch. Future work will explore hiring strategies for high-quality workers across tasks, languages, and platforms, while addressing limitations such as the exclusive focus on English summarization and the lack of guaranteed correctness training.</sample>

    <sample id="247">The paper "FACTKG: Fact Verification via Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs" by Jiho Kim and colleagues introduces a new dataset and task for fact verification using knowledge graphs (KGs) as evidence. Unlike existing datasets like FEVER and VitaminC, which rely on text, or TabFact and InfoTabs, which use tables, FACTKG focuses on verifying natural language claims against KGs. The proposed dataset, FACTKG, leverages DBpedia as the knowledge graph and includes claims in both written and colloquial styles for practical applications. Claims are labeled as either SUPPORTED or REFUTED and require reasoning across five types: one-hop, conjunction, existence, multi-hop, and negation. For example, one-hop claims require verifying a direct relationship between two entities, while multi-hop claims necessitate inferring indirect connections. The dataset also includes colloquial claims generated using a transfer model and presupposition templates. The authors constructed baselines, including a Claim-Only baseline and a GEAR model that utilizes graph evidence. Results show that the GEAR model outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of KG-based reasoning for fact verification. This approach is particularly valuable for applications like dialogue systems that interact with internal knowledge graphs, enabling consistency checks between natural language and KG data. The dataset is available for use, and the authors invite further exploration.</sample>

However, the demographics of the annotators were not explicitly balanced across all categories, and the study acknowledged that demographic data was not always collected and shared. The focus was on obtaining a rich set of demographic data and many annotations per instance to better understand the positionality of NLP datasets and models.</sample>

    <sample id="252">Sai Kiran Tanikella and his team from IIT Kanpur present "U-CREAT: Unsupervised Case Retrieval using Events extraction," addressing the challenge of Prior Case Retrieval in legal contexts. The team developed the IL-PCR dataset, a benchmark with 7,070 Indian legal cases and 6.775 average citations per query, surpassing existing datasets like COLIEE’21 in size and complexity. Their key contribution is the U-CREAT pipeline, which uses unsupervised learning and event extraction to improve PCR efficiency.

The pipeline processes query and candidate documents by extracting events using dependency parsing, forming subject-verb-object triplets. An interaction matrix is then created to rank candidates based on matching events. Experiments show that event-based models, particularly Event Filtered Documents, outperform baseline methods and transformer-based models, achieving higher F1 scores and faster inference times. U-CREAT also outperforms existing approaches on the COLIEE’21 dataset, establishing it as a state-of-the-art method.

    <sample id="253">The research project "DisorBERT: A Double Domain Adaptation Model for Detecting Signs of Mental Disorders in Social Media" focuses on developing an AI model to identify mental health issues through social media posts. The team, comprising researchers from Mexico and Spain, defines mental disorders as psychological syndromes causing distress and disability affecting thinking, feeling, mood, and behavior. Social media provides a rich source of data, as users often share personal experiences and seek help in these platforms.

The study employs domain adaptation to improve the model's performance on mental health-related data. Starting with a general language model like BERT, trained on Wikipedia and Google Books, the researchers adapt it to the specific language of Reddit and mental health. This adaptation involves integrating information from Reddit and mental health lexicon to guide the masking process, allowing the model to focus on domain-specific words.

The proposed approach first learns social media language and then specializes in the mental disorder domain. Guided masking helps the model pay attention to important words during training. Results show that DisorBERT performs well in balancing precision and recall, outperforming other models like MentalBERT, which was trained on a large dataset.

DisorBERT's predictions reveal a bias towards words related to mental disorders, indicating its effectiveness in identifying such issues. The model's attention scores on depression-related posts highlight key topics like anxiety and medication.

In conclusion, the double domain adaptation and guided masking approach effectively captures signs of mental disorders in social media interactions. Future work aims to explore different lexical resources and incorporate clinical data to enhance the model's accuracy and applicability.</sample>
    <sample id="254">The research paper, "Uncertainty Guided Label Denoising for Document-level Distant Relation Extraction," by Sun Qi from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, addresses the challenge of noise in distantly supervised (DS) data used for document-level relation extraction. Traditional methods rely on pseudo labels generated from DS data, which can introduce noise due to false positives. The proposed framework introduces uncertainty-guided label denoising to improve label quality. 

The framework first trains a pre-denoising DocRE model using both DS and human-annotated data to generate pseudo labels. It then estimates uncertainty using Monte Carlo dropout (MC dropout) to determine the reliability of model predictions. For overlapping relations, an instance-level uncertainty estimation method is proposed to capture uncertainty scores for each relation. A re-labeling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds and a multi-phase training strategy are also introduced to further enhance performance.

The dynamic class uncertainty thresholds filter out pseudo labels with high uncertainty, replacing them with lower-uncertainty labels. The multi-phase training strategy iteratively re-labels DS data to boost model performance. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through comparisons with baselines on public datasets, showing improved performance.

In summary, the key contributions include an uncertainty-guided label denoising framework, instance-level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations, a re-labeling strategy for the long-tail problem, and significant performance improvements. This work addresses the noise issue in DS data, enhancing the quality and reliability of document-level relation extraction.</sample>

    <sample id="258">The paper "Can Large Language Models Be an Alternative to Human Evaluation?" explores the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate text quality in natural language processing (NLP). The authors propose that LLMs, given natural language instructions, can rate text samples based on attributes like grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance. This idea is motivated by the instability and reproducibility issues of human evaluations.

The study evaluates this approach by comparing LLM ratings (using models like InstructGPT, Davinci, and ChatGPT) with human ratings (English teachers) on stories generated by GPT-2 and humans. Results show that while some smaller LLMs lack meaningful preferences for human-written text, Davinci and ChatGPT demonstrate a clear preference for human-written stories, aligning with human raters.

The authors address key questions: agreement between LLMs and humans, the impact of instruction wording, sampling methods, and the cost-benefit of LLM evaluation. They conclude that LLMs can serve as a viable alternative to human evaluation in specific tasks, though further research is needed to generalize these findings. The paper also highlights the potential for LLMs to provide consistent, reproducible evaluations, offering a practical solution to the challenges of human evaluation.</sample>

XSemPLR introduces a unified benchmark dataset containing 9 datasets across various domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 natural languages from 15 language families. The benchmark evaluates six settings: Translate-Test (using Google Translate API), Monolingual (same source and target language), Monolingual Few-shot (training with 10% data), Multilingual (training across languages), and Cross-lingual Zero-shot and Few-shot transfer.

Key findings include:
1. **Encoder-Decoder models** outperform all other models across all datasets.
2. **Multilingual training** improves performance for most languages, except English, where performance drops in seven datasets.
3. **Cross-lingual transfer** significantly reduces the performance gap, with Few-shot transfer being more effective than Zero-shot.
4. **Pretraining on English** boosts Few-shot performance on target languages.
5. **Multilingual models like Codex and BLOOM** are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing.

3. **Adaptability**: The planner should be able to adapt to different types of constraints and goals, demonstrating versatility across various scenarios.

4. **Quality and Consistency**: The generated scripts should be of high quality, consistent, and reliable, ensuring that they can be effectively followed to achieve the desired outcome.

5. **Efficiency**: The planner should be able to generate scripts efficiently, balancing between the complexity of the task and the resources available.

6. **Generalizability**: The planner should be able to generalize well across different categories of goals and constraints, showing robust performance across a wide range of tasks.

These qualities are crucial for a planner to effectively decompose abstract goals into specific, constrained, and actionable scripts.</sample>

    <sample id="263">The paper "Mitigating Label Biases for In-context Learning" addresses the instability and bias issues in in-context learning (ICL) for large language models (LLMs). ICL relies on a sequence of labeled examples to guide predictions, but design choices like example order and selection introduce biases, leading to inconsistent performance. The authors categorize label biases into three types: **vanilla-label bias** (model’s uncontextual preferences), **context-label bias** (effects from the context), and a newly identified **domain-label bias** (influence of the task corpus on predictions). They demonstrate that domain-label bias can severely skew model predictions, even with random in-domain words, while random English words have little effect.

To mitigate these biases, the authors propose **domain-context calibration**, which estimates biases using random in-domain words as content-free text. This approach improves decision boundaries and performance, especially for tasks with high domain-label bias. Experiments across datasets and models show significant performance gains, with larger improvements observed in tasks with greater domain-label bias. The method outperforms prior calibration techniques by avoiding single predefined tokens and accounting for domain-specific biases. Overall, the work provides a systematic framework to address label biases in ICL, enhancing the reliability of LLMs in classification tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="264">Lin Wang, a graduate student at Zhejiang University, presents a paper titled "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation," addressing the challenges of multimodal text generation, particularly in domains with limited labeled data and varying construction conditions. The proposed framework, TAVT, aims to train a model that can learn and adapt to new multimodal domains with minimal labeled data. The framework consists of three components: an audio-visual meta-mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model generator, and Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCLL).

The audio-visual meta-mapper network maps visual concepts across domains into a unified auditory semantic space, addressing shifts in semantic distribution. The audio-visual encoder and language model generator use a transformer-based architecture with an alpha parameter to evaluate the contribution of different modalities to each word. DCLL constructs fine-grained supervision signals from counterfactual results to optimize visual-textual alignment.

Experimental results show that TAVT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both cross-datasets and cross-domain settings, particularly in low-resource domains with limited labeled data. Ablation experiments also highlight the importance of audio features in enhancing performance. Overall, TAVT demonstrates significant advancements in transferable audio-visual text generation, paving the way for more efficient and effective multimodal text generation systems.</sample>

In the context of the paper, the method compares personas of marked groups (e.g., women of color) against unmarked groups (e.g., white men) using weighted log-odds ratios to highlight stereotypes and essentializing narratives embedded in the language.

    <sample id="280">Shi Tao presents "MultiEMO: An Attention-Based Correlation-Aware Multimodal Fusion Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversations," addressing challenges in Emotion Regulation in Conversations (ERC). ERC aims to predict the emotion of each utterance in a dialogue, integrating textual, audio, and visual modalities. Existing methods often focus on textual data or simple feature concatenation, failing to exploit multimodal complementarity, underperforming on minority emotions, and struggling with distinguishing semantically similar emotions.

MultiEMO introduces four key components: unimodel feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion, and emotion classification. Its main contributions include:

1. **VisExtNet**: A novel visual feature extractor that focuses on facial expressions rather than redundant scene information, using MTCNN and VGGFace2 pre-trained ResNet-101.
2. **MultiAttn**: A multimodal fusion model using bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers to integrate textual, audio, and visual modalities effectively.
3. **Sample-Weighted Focal Contrast Loss (SWFC)**: A loss function that emphasizes hard-to-classify minority emotions and maximizes inter-class distances for better distinguishing semantically similar emotions.

Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets show state-of-the-art performance, particularly in minority and semantically similar emotions. However, limitations include challenges in speaker identification, computational requirements for SWFC, and ongoing performance gaps in minority emotions. MultiEMO demonstrates superior performance in difficult scenarios, as visualized by heatmaps.</sample>
    <sample id="281">The research titled "When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-driven, Multilingual Exploration" investigates the role of context in machine translation. Led by Kayo Yin and co-authored by Patrick Fernandes, Emmy Liu, André F. T. Martins, and Graham Neubig, the study analyzes how context influences translation accuracy, particularly for words with ambiguous meanings. Using a dataset of TED talks translated into 14 languages, the team developed a measure called Pointwise Contextual Information Measure (P-CXMI) to quantify context dependency at the sentence and word levels.

The analysis revealed that certain linguistic phenomena, such as dual pronouns in Arabic, verb forms, and proper nouns in Chinese, require context for accurate translation. The researchers also identified the importance of formality and ellipsis resolution in translation. To address these findings, they created the Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) tagger, which identifies context-dependent words in parallel corpora.

The study compared translation models using both corpus-level metrics (e.g., BLEU) and the MuDA benchmark. While context-agnostic models performed better on corpus-level metrics, context-aware models excelled in handling specific discourse phenomena. The benchmark also demonstrated that DeepL outperformed Google Translate in document-level translation.

In conclusion, the research highlights the limitations of traditional metrics in evaluating context-dependent translations and provides a framework to assess models' ability to handle various discourse phenomena, guiding future improvements in document-level machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="282">**Abstract:**  
At ACL 2023, we present *StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Author-Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing*, addressing the challenge of story-level style transfer in non-parallel text. Unlike prior work focusing on token or sentence-level style transfer, our approach targets discourse-level linguistic preferences, which are critical for imitating author style. The primary challenges include capturing author-specific discourse structures and style-topic associations, which are difficult to transfer across texts. To address these, we propose *StoryTrans*, a generation model that learns discourse representations from source texts and combines them with learnable style embeddings. The model employs a two-stage training framework: (1) style transfer with masked style-specific content keywords and (2) content enhancement by explicitly incorporating these keywords. For training, we use an advisory framework, including self-reconstruction loss, disentanglement loss, sentence order loss, and style classifier loss to align style and content. In experiments, we evaluate *StoryTrans* on Chinese and English datasets, demonstrating superior performance in style control and content preservation compared to baselines. Manual evaluations and style visualization confirm the model’s ability to align with target styles and enrich storylines while maintaining semantics. Our work provides a comprehensive solution for non-parallel story-level style transfer, with datasets and code available for further exploration.</sample>

    <sample id="284">In this paper, Peng Tianshuo from Wuhan University introduces **FSUIE (Fuzzy Span Mechanism for Universal Information Extraction)**, a novel approach to enhance span-based Universal Information Extraction (UIE) models. Traditional UIE models rely heavily on precise span boundary annotations, which can be ambiguous. FSUIE addresses this by introducing **fuzzy span boundaries**, allowing the model to learn a continuous distribution of correct probabilities for span boundaries rather than fixed positions. Additionally, FSUIE resolves the mismatch between transformer feature extraction and UIE by proposing **adaptive fuzzy span attention**, which dynamically adjusts the attention span and linearly decays attention near the boundary. This approach improves the model's ability to focus on relevant semantic information within a limited range of tokens.

The proposed method includes a **fuzzy span loss** that combines Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) with KL-divergence to handle fuzzy boundaries and supplementary information. The **fuzzy span attention layer** is added to guide the model's decision-making without affecting text encoding. FSUIE is evaluated on three UIE tasks: named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction. Results show significant performance improvements, particularly on small-scale datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on relationship extraction tasks and competitive results on aspect sentiment tasks. Ablation studies confirm that the fuzzy span loss (FSL) and fuzzy span attention (FSA) contribute to improved convergence and information extraction capabilities. FSUIE demonstrates stronger generalization and adaptability, making it a robust solution for universal information extraction tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="285">Mingqi Gao from Peking University presents research on "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation Framework." The study addresses factual errors in dialogue summaries, a critical issue often overlooked in summarization models. Existing solutions include training models to prioritize factuality or designing separate Factual Error Correction (FEC) models. However, current FEC evaluations using factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE have flaws: they provide vague scores and blur the line between FEC and summarization model improvements.

The research argues for using manually annotated reference corrections to evaluate FEC models more accurately. These corrections ensure that factual errors are addressed minimally (substitution, insertion, deletion) while maintaining fluency and non-redundancy. A new taxonomy of factual errors is proposed, categorizing them as content-based (based on part of speech and dependencies) and form-based (addition, deletion, substitution).

The evaluation framework, inspired by ERRANT, involves alignment, classification, and comparison of errors. Experiments show that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue datasets yields better results than relying on factuality metrics. The study highlights the need to improve FEC evaluation methods, emphasizing the importance of human-corrected summaries and combining them with synthetic data. Current FEC models also struggle with certain errors, such as additions, attribute errors, modality errors, and link errors, indicating areas for future improvement. Overall, the research underscores the necessity of fine-grained evaluation to enhance factual error correction in dialogue summarization.</sample>

    <sample id="296">Valerio Basile presents a collaborative project between the University of Turin and Amazon Alexa, focusing on irony detection in natural language processing (NLP). The team developed the English Perspectivist Irony Corpus (EPIC) by collecting 300 short conversations from social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter over 1½ years, across five varieties of English. Crowdsourcing platform Prolific was used to gather annotations from 74 annotators, resulting in an average of 5 annotations per conversation. The annotation interface was simple, asking annotators to label replies as ironic or not in context.

The study revealed significant inter-annotator agreement differences based on factors like gender, age, and nationality, leading to the development of perspective-aware models. These models, fine-tuned on splits corresponding to different annotators, showed higher confidence in predictions compared to aggregated gold standard models. Further analysis highlighted that generational proximity and geographical differences (e.g., UK vs. Ireland) contributed to annotation disagreements, suggesting that irony perception varies across perspectives. The project aims to improve NLP models by incorporating these perspectivist insights.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The project "From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns: Unveiling Coded Rhetoric with Language Models" explores coded language, or dogwhistles, used in political discourse to convey hidden, often hateful, messages to specific in-groups while maintaining plausible deniability to the broader audience. A dogwhistle is a term or phrase that sends one message to the general public and another to a targeted group, often with racist, anti-Semitic, or transphobic connotations. For example, the term "cosmopolitan" can be a dogwhistle for Jewish people.

The research team developed a typology and glossary of over 340 dogwhistles, categorized by register (formal or informal), persona (e.g., anti-Semitic, transphobic), and type (whether the message adds an additional implicature or merely signals a persona). They analyzed historical U.S. political speeches, finding that the use of racial dogwhistles increased post-Civil Rights era, aligning with the Republican Southern Strategy. The study also observed a growing association of dogwhistles with conservatism over time.

The team evaluated dogwhistle recognition in language models, particularly GPT-3, through various experiments. They found that GPT-3 could surface many dogwhistles, especially formal ones, but struggled with informal and social media-specific dogwhistles, as well as transphobic ones. Adding definitions and secret cues to prompts significantly improved performance.

Finally, the project demonstrated how dogwhistles can evade content moderation by showing that hateful sentences rated as less toxic when standard slurs were replaced with dogwhistles, highlighting the challenge of automated toxicity detection in online content moderation.</sample>
    <sample id="298">The finding that led to the conclusion that temporal drift is the main cause of performance loss was the observation that models' performance degraded with a larger temporal gap between the training and test data. This was confirmed through an experiment where models were retrained or continued to pre-train with more recent data, showing that the performance degrades as the temporal gap increases. This supports the hypothesis that temporal drift, rather than adaptive overfitting, is the primary cause of the performance drop.</sample>
    <sample id="299">Michalis Korakakis and Andreas Vlachos present a method to improve the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models by reducing their reliance on shortcuts—spurious correlations that can lead to poor out-of-distribution performance. NLI models often exploit these shortcuts, which are prevalent in training data but not in adversarial test sets, leading to brittle generalization. Existing shortcut mitigation methods require auxiliary models that may not always align with the learner's behavior, and they often assume domain-specific knowledge.

The proposed method, called minimax training, uses a learner and an auxiliary model in a competitive training dynamic. The learner aims to minimize NLI task loss, while the auxiliary aims to maximize the learner's loss by generating example weights that focus the learner on high-loss regions. This incentivizes the learner to prioritize under-represented "hard" examples that counteract shortcuts present in dominant "easy" examples. The method does not assume specific shortcut types and relies on the learner's training dynamics to generate example weights.

Experiments on analytic datasets (MNLI, FEVER, QQP) and adversarial test sets (HANS Symmetric, PAWS) show that minimax training improves out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy. The method is evaluated further to assess its effectiveness in larger models, synthetic shortcuts, and out-of-domain test sets. Qualitative analysis of the learned example weight distribution is also conducted. The authors invite discussion during the poster session.</sample>
    <sample id="300">Interactive Dictation is a new task introduced by Belinda and her colleagues at Semantic Machines, aiming to enable users to dictate and edit documents using voice commands in a natural and intuitive manner. Unlike traditional speech-to-text systems, which separate dictation from editing through trigger words, interactive dictation allows for flexible interleaving of dictation and editing using open-ended natural language utterances. The task involves four steps: ASR recognition, segmentation into dictation and command utterances, command extraction and normalization, and execution of dictation and command utterances to reach the final document state.

To formalize the task, the team designed a data collection interface and built a dataset, collecting trajectories of dictation and command utterances. They also developed a baseline system that performs each of the four steps, using separate models for ASR recognition, segmentation, ASR repair, and interpretation. The interpretation model was experimented with two different architectures (T5 and GPT-3) and two types of outputs (predicting programs or directly predicting the next state). The results showed that GPT-3 models were more accurate but slower, while T5 models allowed for improved efficiency with minimal impact on accuracy. The team released code and a paper to facilitate future work on this task.</sample>
    <sample id="302">It is necessary to permute the tokens for the output sequence because, after the first step of tagging each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output, the tokens are not yet in their correct order. The permutation step is required to arrange these tokens into the correct sequence that corresponds to the output logical form, ensuring that the model can generate the correct output sequence that matches the input's meaning.</sample>
    <sample id="303">The authors recommended increasing transparency about bias mitigation methods because it is unclear whether positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives in generated personas are due to specific value alignments, anti-stereotyping methods, or other factors.

    <sample id="304">Minimal-pair unacceptable inputs are pairs of sentences that differ by only one word or element, where one sentence is grammatically acceptable or semantically appropriate, and the other is not. These pairs are used to evaluate language models' ability to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable language. In the context of the ACL 2023 paper, minimal-pair unacceptable inputs are recreated by adding acceptable or unacceptable sentences from datasets (e.g., BLiMP, SyntaxGym) as prefixes to the original minimal pair sentences, allowing for the evaluation of models' acceptability judgments across longer sequences and varying contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="305">The video discusses the limitations of Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL) methods, which typically claim to achieve high performance on clean test sets using only weakly labeled data. However, the research reveals that these methods often require clean validation samples to function effectively, as they help the models generalize beyond the noisy weak labels. Without clean validation data, WSL approaches fail to generalize, leading to poor performance. The study also shows that increasing the number of clean validation samples improves performance, and in some cases, directly fine-tuning on clean samples outperforms WSL methods. The researchers recommend that future WSL work should disclose model selection criteria, compare WSL with few-shot learning baselines, and consider continuous fine-tuning as a strong baseline. The code for the study has been open-sourced and is available via a QR code.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim present their research on entity tracking in language models, a crucial ability for understanding longer discourses. They designed a task involving boxes and objects to evaluate this capability, ensuring it doesn't rely on pre-training data patterns, heuristics, or fine-tuning. The task involves predicting box contents after state-changing operations. Results show that only GPT-3.5 models, pre-trained on code, exhibit non-trivial entity tracking, while others perform poorly. Smaller models like T5-base can learn the task with direct fine-tuning, but randomly initialized models cannot. The study highlights the importance of pre-training on code for entity tracking but questions whether these abilities generalize beyond their specific setup. They invite further exploration and discussion at ACL.</sample>

    <sample id="308">Jenny, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, presents research on **NLPositionality**, a framework to characterize design biases in NLP datasets and models. The work, conducted in collaboration with researchers from the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, addresses how NLP tools like toxicity detection APIs (e.g., Prospective API) perform differently across populations. For instance, Prospective API is effective for English-speaking users but struggles with detecting context-specific toxicity in Indian users. This highlights **design biases**, where models and datasets disproportionately favor certain demographics over others.

NLPositionality studies these biases by comparing annotations from diverse, real-world users with existing datasets and models. The framework uses re-annotation by multiple annotators from varied demographic backgrounds and measures alignment using Pearson's R correlation. This approach differs from traditional annotator disagreement studies by focusing on end-user alignment rather than annotator distributions.

The research, conducted via Lab in the Wild and online crowdsourcing, gathered over 16,000 annotations from 1,000 annotators across 87 countries. Findings reveal that datasets and models are most aligned with English-speaking countries and individuals with higher education levels. However, they are less aligned with non-binary individuals, highlighting systemic biases.

To address these issues, the team recommends documenting design choices, adopting a perspectivist lens in research, and building specialized datasets and models within underrepresented communities. Inclusive NLP, they emphasize, is not just about universal functionality but about addressing the specific needs of diverse populations.</sample>

1. **First Multi-Modal Instruction Tuning Benchmark**: MultiInstruct is the first large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-modal instruction tuning, addressing the lack of publicly available multi-modal instructional datasets.

2. **Diverse Multi-Modal Tasks**: It includes 62 diverse multi-modal tasks across 10 broad categories, derived from 21 existing open-source datasets, providing a comprehensive range of multi-modal scenarios.

3. **Unified Sequence-to-Sequence Format**: MultiInstruct represents all tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format, integrating input text, images, instructions, and bounding boxes into the same token space, which is a novel approach to handling multi-modal data.

4. **Instruction Tuning for Multi-Modal Models**: Unlike previous works that focused on language-only tasks, MultiInstruct specifically investigates the effectiveness of instruction tuning for multi-modal pre-trained models like OFA.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: MultiInstruct introduces a new evaluation metric called **sensitivity**, which measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction. This provides a more nuanced understanding of model performance.

6. **Transfer Learning from Natural Instruction Datasets**: MultiInstruct explores the benefits of transfer learning from natural instruction datasets, demonstrating improved performance and sensitivity when fine-tuning multi-modal models.

In summary, MultiInstruct stands out as the first large-scale, multi-modal instruction tuning benchmark, addressing the gap in instructional datasets and providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving multi-modal models.</sample>

    <sample id="314">Binary coordination refers to the structure of coordination where two elements (conjuncts) are linked together, typically by a coordinating conjunction (e.g., "and", "or"). In this structure, one of the conjuncts is designated as the head of the coordinate structure, which is a characteristic of asymmetric approaches like Universal Dependencies and Igor Mel'čuk's meaning text theory. The head conjunct governs the entire coordinate structure, and dependencies from the head to the other conjunct are established. This contrasts with the conjunction-headed approach, where the coordinating conjunction itself is the head of the coordinate structure, and dependencies extend from the conjunction to both conjuncts. Binary coordination is a fundamental concept in dependency grammar and syntactic analysis, and understanding its structure is crucial for parsing and linguistic research.</sample>

    <sample id="316">The findings suggest that smaller models, specifically T5 fine-tuned on the CoScript dataset, can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models for constrained language planning tasks. This implies that with the right dataset tailored to the specific problem of constrained language planning, smaller models can potentially surpass larger models in performance. This has several implications:

1. **Resource Efficiency**: Smaller models require fewer computational resources, making them more cost-effective and environmentally friendly for deployment in various applications.

2. **Scalability**: Smaller models can be more easily scaled to handle larger datasets or deployed in environments with limited computational power.

3. **Specialization**: The results indicate that smaller models can be specialized for specific tasks through appropriate dataset curation, leading to better performance in those domains.

4. **Accessibility**: Smaller models can be more accessible to a broader range of users and organizations, as they do not require the same level of computational infrastructure as larger models.

5. **Further Research**: The findings encourage further research into how to effectively curate and use datasets to train smaller models for various tasks, potentially leading to more efficient and effective AI systems.

Overall, the implications of these findings are significant, as they challenge the notion that larger models are always better and open up new possibilities for the development and deployment of AI systems.</sample>
    <sample id="317">The presentation discusses a research paper titled "CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information Extractors," authored by Peng Li from Fudan University. The paper addresses the challenges in information extraction (IE), a task in natural language processing that involves extracting structured information from unstructured text. Traditional models like T5 and GPT-3 struggle with mismatched outputs between pre-training and inference phases, requiring extensive structured training data and special decoding strategies.

To overcome these issues, the proposed method, CodeIE, transforms the text-to-structured IE task into a structure-to-structure code generation task. This approach leverages large code generation models like Codex, which are better aligned with the IE task. The method involves converting text to a structured format during input and ensuring aligned structures in the output.

The paper evaluates CodeIE on seven datasets, comparing it with traditional models like T5 and GPT-3. Results show that CodeIE, using code format prompts and Codex, significantly outperforms traditional models, especially in few-shot scenarios. Key findings include:

1. **Perplexity**: Code format inputs have lower perplexity for models like CodeT5 compared to text format inputs for T5.
2. **Structural Errors**: Code format prompts with Codex result in fewer structural errors compared to text format prompts with GPT-3.
3. **Label Expansion**: GPT-3 often outputs labels not present in the predefined set, whereas Codex performs better overall.
4. **Recall**: Code format prompts improve recall compared to text format prompts.

The study highlights the effectiveness of using code generation models and prompts for information extraction tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.</sample>

3. **Control pre-training**: Using pre-trained weights and tokenization from another model (CamemBERT) and fine-tuning on a smaller dataset (4 GB of NACHOS).
4. **Data source comparison**: Evaluating the impact of using different data sources (NACHOS, clinical notes, and a mix of both) on model performance.
5. **Data size comparison**: Assessing the effect of varying the amount of training data (4 GB vs. 7 GB) on model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="320">The paper does not provide a specific numerical factor for overfitting due to test reuse (adaptive overfitting). Instead, it concludes that adaptive overfitting is not observed in this case because the performance improvement on CoNLL-2003 translates to more than one unit of improvement on CoNLL++, indicating no diminishing returns. This suggests that the performance drop is more likely due to temporal drift rather than adaptive overfitting. Therefore, the factor of overfitting due to test reuse specifically is not quantified in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="321">The quality of the simplification in the DEPLAIN corpus was evaluated through a detailed analysis of the sentence pairs, which were manually aligned. The evaluation focused on several aspects:

1. **Type of Simplification**: The corpus was analyzed to determine the nature of the simplifications, such as lexical simplification, structure simplification, and overall level of simplification. This helped in understanding the extent and type of changes made to the original text.

2. **Domain-Specific Simplification**: The analysis considered the domain from which the texts originated (e.g., news, Bible, language learner texts). This allowed for an assessment of how different domains influenced the level and type of simplification.

3. **Variety of Simplification Transformations**: The corpus was examined to identify the different types of transformations used in simplification, such as reorderings, word additions, and rephrasings. This provided insights into the diversity of simplification techniques employed.

4. **Comparison of Subcorpora**: The two subcorpora, DEPLAIN-apa and DEPLAIN-web, were compared to understand the differences in simplification techniques and their effectiveness across different domains.

By evaluating these aspects, the researchers were able to assess the quality and effectiveness of the simplifications in the DEPLAIN corpus, providing a comprehensive basis for further research and application in text simplification tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="322">Enrico's presentation at ACL 23 explores how text classifiers can understand and express morality, a complex and subjective concept. He emphasizes that morality is not a simple binary scale but a pluralistic and subjective construct influenced by various social theories, such as the Moral Foundations Theory, which identifies five distinct moral dimensions (e.g., fairness, authority). 

Enrico highlights the limitations of treating morality as a singular scale and argues that teaching language models only the average or majority view can obscure the nuanced nature of morality. Instead, he proposes analyzing how morality is expressed differently across various domains, using datasets like the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus, which includes tweets from diverse domains such as #AllLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter.

Through explainable AI techniques, Enrico and his team demonstrate that language models can recognize subtle differences in moral expression across domains. For example, they show that language models distinguish between how subversion is perceived in #AllLivesMatter (frowned upon) and #BlackLivesMatter (encouraged). This research underscores the importance of domain-specific understanding in text classifiers to avoid misinterpretations of morality. Enrico concludes by urging caution in using generalized models across diverse domains, emphasizing the need for nuanced approaches to capture the complexity of morality in language.</sample>
    <sample id="323">Yujie Wang from Shanxi University proposes a novel approach called **Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning (DHLK)** to address challenges in Commonsense QA. Existing methods combine language models and knowledge graphs (HKGs) but suffer from noisy entities, isolated encoding, and lack of semantic relationship modeling. DHLK tackles these issues by:

1. **Building an Optimized HKG**: Using a two-stage pruning strategy and Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) to refine the structure and knowledge representation of the HKG.
2. **Enhancing Subgraph Construction**: Adding paraphrases of key entities from WordNet and Wiktionary as nodes, while dynamically removing irrelevant entities based on RoBERTa attention weights.
3. **Fusing Modalities**: Encoding QA contexts and entities using RoBERTa and Mask Self-Attention, with Relation Mask Self-Attention (RMSA) modeling the subgraph relationships.
4. **Graph Embedding**: Optimizing entity and relation embeddings using TransE and max-pooling the graph embeddings.
5. **Path Information Integration**: Incorporating HKG path information into the QA context for enhanced representation.
6. **Final Prediction**: Using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict answers by combining HKG embeddings, path information, and QA context.

Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA demonstrate DHLK's effectiveness, outperforming other LM and HKG methods. The approach leverages external knowledge bases (ConceptNet, WordNet, Wiktionary) and key entity extraction via KeyBERT, showcasing improved performance in Commonsense QA tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Yes, language models have different political biases. Research has shown that language models trained on large-scale web crawl data, which includes diverse political news media, can exhibit varying political leanings. For example, GPT-4 is identified as the most liberal language model, while GPT series generally tend to be more socially liberal than BART series and its variants. These biases can propagate from pretraining data to language models and further influence downstream tasks, potentially leading to fairness issues in NLP applications.</sample>
    <sample id="326">Cognitive dissonance is a psychological state where an individual holds two or more beliefs, values, or attitudes that are inconsistent with each other, or where their behavior contradicts their beliefs or values. This inconsistency can lead to discomfort or anxiety, motivating the individual to reduce the dissonance by changing their beliefs, attitudes, or behavior to achieve consistency. For example, a person who knows that smoking is harmful (belief) but continues to smoke (behavior) may experience cognitive dissonance, which can be resolved by justifying the behavior (e.g., "I need a cigarette after meetings to stay alert") or by changing their belief (e.g., "Smoking isn't as harmful as I thought").</sample>
    <sample id="327">Xiao Xu, a PhD student from Harbin Institute of Technology, presents "ManagerTower: Aggregating the Insights of Uni-Modal Experts for Vision-Language Representation Learning" at ACL 2023. The work aims to improve Vision-Language (VL) learning by effectively utilizing unimodal semantic knowledge at different levels. Unlike previous architectures like BridgeTower, which suffer from limitations in layer-by-layer utilization and scalability, ManagerTower introduces "managers" in each cross-modal layer to adaptively aggregate insights from pre-trained unimodal experts (e.g., RoBERTa, CLIP-ViT). This approach allows for more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion. ManagerTower demonstrates superior performance on downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQAv2), with only four million images for pre-training, outperforming models like METER and BridgeTower. The adaptive nature of managers is validated through visualization of aggregation weights, showing diverse and adaptive exploitation of unimodal semantic knowledge across cross-modal layers. The paper, code, and models are available on Archive and GitHub. ManagerTower's innovative design and performance improvements highlight its potential for advancing VL representation learning.</sample>

    <sample id="329">This paper presents a novel approach to zero-shot video sentence localization, a task that identifies relevant video segments corresponding to natural language queries. The authors, from Peking University, address the challenge of requiring extensive manual annotations for training by proposing a noise-resistant method for generating structured pseudo-labels. Their approach overcomes limitations of existing methods, which often produce simplistic pseudo-queries and fail to ensure low relevance between video segments outside events and queries.

The proposed method involves three key steps: (1) generating complex pseudo-queries using a pre-trained image caption model, (2) creating pseudo-events by modeling the temporal structure of events to ensure high relevance within events and low relevance outside, and (3) reducing label noise by re-weighting samples based on model confidence and IoU, and refining pseudo-labels through iterative training.

Experiments on ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness, outperforming existing zero-shot methods in terms of R@M and mIoU metrics. The authors conclude that their structured pseudo-label generation method robustly handles label noise, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. The code for their implementation is available for further exploration.</sample>

    <sample id="333">Wenhao from Nanjing University introduces "INK: Injecting kNN Knowledge in Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation," a framework to enhance neural machine translation (NMT) models. NMT models often suffer from a non-smooth representation space, leading to sparse, low-frequency token distributions and poor generalization. To address this, INK proposes a training loop that iteratively refines the representation space using kNN knowledge. The loop involves two steps: extracting kNN knowledge to guide an adapter in adjusting representations and asynchronously updating the datastore. This approach improves the representation space, enabling better performance and faster inference. Experiments show that INK outperforms state-of-the-art kNN-MT systems, achieving an average gain of 1.99 COMET score and 1.0 BLEU score, while requiring less memory and faster inference.

    <sample id="336">Cross-lingual transfer refers to the process of leveraging knowledge or models trained in one language to improve performance in another language, without explicit adaptation or retraining for the target language. In the context of semantic parsing, this involves using a model trained on a source language (e.g., English) to perform tasks in a target language (e.g., German or Chinese) by translating the query or transferring the learned representations. This approach aims to bridge the gap between languages and improve cross-lingual performance, often through techniques like zero-shot or few-shot transfer learning.</sample>
    <sample id="337">The research paper "Graph-based Relation Mining for Context-free Out-of-vocabulary Word Embedding Learning" addresses the challenge of representing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in embedding models, which are crucial for downstream tasks. The authors propose a novel approach that leverages word formation and association to infer the meaning of OOV words. They introduce a Word Relationship Graph that mimics lexical rules, where each word or wordpiece acts as a node with its corresponding embedding as node attributes. The graph is structured in two layers: the first layer retains all wordpieces for complete information, while the second layer samples a fixed number of nodes to mitigate noise.

To handle OOV nodes, the authors use a self-attention network that assigns attributes based on the characters of OOV words. Two levels of Graph Attention Network (GAT) are applied to extract important information and reduce noise. A readout block layer is added to capture graph-level information. The model employs contrastive learning in the loss function, using NT-XENT with positive samples like two-hop relevant words, synonyms, or the OOV word itself, to encourage proximity in the embedding space.

Experiments show that the model outperforms baselines in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning OOV words through word formation. The approach benefits both static and contextual models in downstream tasks. The authors also discuss the potential of extending the model to other languages, noting that agglutinative languages are well-suited, while fusional languages present more challenges. Overall, the model's graph structure can handle complex word formations, making it adaptable to various linguistic contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="338">The research titled "Are Human Explanations Always Helpful? Towards Objective Evaluation of Human Natural Language Explanations" explores the quality and utility of human-annotated explanations in improving AI models' performance. The study, conducted by researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research, addresses the challenge of evaluating human explanations, which can be subjective and task-dependent. Unlike labels, explanations are not always considered the gold standard, and traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE focus on word similarity, failing to account for task differences and the varying utility of explanations during fine-tuning and inference.

The researchers propose a unified data structure that converts various tasks into a standardized multiple-choice format, enabling seamless application across different tasks. They conducted experiments using five datasets (CoS-E, ECQA, e-SNLI, ComVE) and two models (T5, BART), analyzing the impact of explanations on model performance. Key findings include:

1. **Fine-tuning and Inference**: Fine-tuning with explanations teaches models to rely on them for predictions, but explanations do not introduce new knowledge.
2. **Task-Dependent Utility**: Explanations from ECQA were more helpful than those from CoS-E on baseline models, highlighting the task-dependent nature of explanations.
3. **Small Data Improvement**: Even a small amount of explanation-incorporated data during fine-tuning can lead to significant performance improvements.

The researchers introduce a novel metric, **TREU (Task-Relative Explainability Utility)**, which extends the simulatability score by evaluating explanation helpfulness during fine-tuning. TREU outperforms the simulatability score in reflecting the actual utility of explanations across different datasets and tasks. The study emphasizes the importance of considering task-specific factors and explanation formats, such as negation and counterfactual styles, in evaluating human explanations. This work lays the foundation for high-quality human collaboration in annotation jobs and encourages future research to validate similar quality checks.</sample>

    <sample id="340">Kuan-Hao Huang from UCLA presents "ParaAMR: A Large-Scale Syntactically Diverse Paraphrase Dataset by AMR Back-Translation," a collaborative effort with Varun, I-Hung, Anoop, Kai-Wei, and Aram. The work addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, syntactically diverse paraphrase datasets for NLP applications like question answering, chatbots, and robustness training. Existing datasets, such as MRPC, PAN, and Quora, are high-quality but limited in scale, while automatically generated datasets like back-translation lack syntactic diversity. ParaAMR leverages AMR (Abstract Meaning Representations) graphs, which capture sentence semantics with nodes for concepts and edges for relations. The approach involves parsing source sentences into AMR graphs, randomly sampling a node as the new focus, modifying the graph structure, and generating text from the altered graph. This method ensures semantic similarity while introducing syntactic diversity. ParaAMR contains 15 million source sentences with 6.9 paraphrases each, demonstrating higher syntactic diversity compared to other datasets while maintaining semantic similarity. The dataset benefits NLP applications, including sentence embedding learning, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few-shot learning. ParaAMR outperforms other datasets in STS testing and few-shot learning tasks. The dataset is available online and highlights its potential for advancing NLP research and applications.</sample>

    <sample id="342">The paper, "LiveChat: A Large-Scale Personalized Dialogue Dataset Automatically Constructed from Live Streaming," introduces a novel dataset designed to address the limitations of existing open-domain and personalized dialogue datasets. The dataset, LiveChat, is constructed from Chinese TikTok (Douyin) live streaming videos, focusing on video-sourced dialogue to better reflect real-world spoken conversations. Unlike traditional datasets that rely on manual annotations or scripted content, LiveChat is automatically generated through three key steps: (1) extracting audio from videos and transcribing it into utterances, (2) constructing dialogues using a reply-to-whom matching method from audience comments, and (3) collecting persona information for personalized dialogue generation.

The dataset stands out for its large scale, video-source nature, and longer average sessions per persona, making it particularly useful for tasks like response modeling and addressee recognition. Experiments demonstrate that persona information and longer sessions enhance performance, while both rule-based and classifier-based persona extraction methods are valuable. Additionally, LiveChat outperforms existing datasets in terms of informativeness and adaptability for personalized dialogue. The study also highlights the importance of efficient transfer learning for large language models (LLMs) on LiveChat, paving the way for future advancements in open-domain and personalized dialogue systems.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree-based methods for compositional generalization include:

1. **Complexity in Obtaining Trees**: Trees are not typically provided and require specialized grammar-induction procedures or pre-processing, which can be computationally expensive and formalism-specific.
2. **Handling Variable Symbols**: Trees often need significant pre-processing to handle variable symbols, adding to the complexity.
3. **Lack of Flexibility**: Tree-based methods are rigid and may not generalize well to unseen structures without extensive training data on similar tree patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a novel approach to compositional generalization in semantic parsing without relying on trees. Compositional generalization refers to a model's ability to handle unseen, deeper recursion and novel combinations of phrases encountered during training. Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, often producing outputs that lack systematic correspondences with the input. Tree-based methods, which aim to capture compositional processes, are effective but require computationally intensive tree generation, often involving specialized grammar induction and pre-processing.

The proposed method, "Multiset Tagging and Latent Permutations," directly models correspondences between input and output fragments using a neural seq2seq architecture. It consists of two steps: first, tagging each input token with an unordered multiset of output tokens, and second, predicting a permutation to order these tokens. This approach avoids the need for trees and is highly flexible, as it does not impose hard constraints on possible permutations.

The permutation model operates by iteratively selecting tokens from the multiset to fill output positions, ensuring each token is used exactly once. This method addresses the challenges of aligning input and output tokens in training data and handling latent, linguistically correct permutations. The NP-hard problem of finding the highest-scoring permutation is approximated using a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation, enabling backpropagation and learning of more plausible permutations.

Experiments on the COGS benchmark demonstrate that this approach outperforms other treeless models, particularly in generalizing to deeper recursion. However, structural generalization remains challenging in some cases. The paper highlights the technical innovations that address these challenges, offering a promising alternative to tree-based methods for compositional generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="348">**Abstract:**  
This paper, "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models," investigates stereotypes in large language models (LLMs) by generating personas through natural language prompts. Unlike traditional methods that rely on hand-curated datasets, this approach generalizes across demographics and contexts, enabling the measurement of intersectional biases. The study reveals patterns in LLM-generated personas, such as associating women of color with traits like "exotic" or "strong," while white men are unmarked. The Marked Words method, inspired by sociolinguistic markedness, identifies distinguishing words for marked groups (e.g., "culture," "tradition") compared to unmarked groups (e.g., white, male). Results show that while LLMs generate fewer stereotypes than human-written personas, they still perpetuate harmful essentializing narratives, such as hyper-sexualizing Asian women or reinforcing the "Strong Black Women" archetype. The paper concludes with three recommendations: addressing positive stereotypes, adopting an intersectional lens, and increasing transparency in bias mitigation methods to better understand and mitigate these pernicious patterns. This work highlights the need for nuanced approaches to studying and mitigating bias in LLMs.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The paper "What’s the Meaning of Superhuman Performance in Today’s NLU?" by Simone Tedeschi and collaborators critically examines the validity of claims that AI systems have achieved superhuman performance in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The authors argue that while AI systems often outperform humans on leaderboard-based benchmarks, this does not necessarily mean they excel in tasks requiring knowledge, reasoning, and inference. They highlight issues such as unfair comparisons, reliance on spurious patterns, and inadequate human evaluation.

The study analyzes two prominent benchmarks, SuperGLUE and SQuAD, and finds that humans are often outperformed by systems, but this is due to factors like evaluating humans on smaller subsets of data, errors in ground-truth answers, and lack of motivation among human annotators. The authors also criticize the vague use of "human baseline" and the aggregation of human performance without considering the best possible human performance. They argue that such benchmarks are not scientifically meaningful without detailed information about the annotator pool and evaluation conditions.

In conclusion, the paper calls for more reliable benchmarks and better practices to avoid repeating these mistakes, emphasizing that claims of superhuman performance in NLU remain unfounded.</sample>
    <sample id="351">This paper investigates the generalization capabilities of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models trained on the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which has been used for nearly two decades. The authors created the CoNLL++ dataset, comprising Reuters news articles from 2020 annotated using the same guidelines, to evaluate how well these models perform on modern data. They fine-tuned over 20 models on CoNLL-2003 and tested them on both CoNLL-03 and CoNLL++. The percentage change in F1 scores was calculated to assess generalization.

The study identifies three key factors for effective generalization: model architecture (with transformers performing better), model size (larger models generally generalize better), and the number of fine-tuning examples (more examples lead to better performance). The authors tested two hypotheses for performance drop: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. They found no evidence of adaptive overfitting, as improvements on CoNLL-2003 did not diminish when applied to CoNLL++. However, temporal drift was confirmed as a significant factor, with performance degrading as the gap between training and testing data increased.

In conclusion, the paper affirms that CoNLL-2003 taggers still perform well in 2023, primarily due to their adaptability to new data. The research highlights the importance of model architecture, size, and training data quantity for effective generalization. It also underscores temporal drift as a critical issue for maintaining model performance over time. The authors call for further research to improve model generalization and encourage readers to explore their dataset and paper.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" by Haau-Sing Li, Mohsen Mesgar, André F. T. Martins, and Iryna Gurevych addresses the challenge of input underspecification in code generation and program synthesis tasks. The authors propose a method to interactively generate code by asking clarification questions to users, focusing on operation-level specifications. They introduce a synthetic dataset, CodeClarQA, with clarifications on key operations, and a pipeline that includes a Clarification Need Predictor, a Question Selector, and a Code Generator.

The pipeline's performance is evaluated against a model-only approach, showing improvements in code generation quality when using high-ranked clarification questions. However, the pipeline still underperforms the model-only approach, indicating that the task of generating effective clarification questions remains challenging. The authors suggest that clarified key operations contribute to better code generation, and provide examples of predictions that are close to the ground truth. The paper highlights the need for further research to improve the clarification question generation process and the code generation pipeline. The authors invite feedback on their paper and code, encouraging the community to contribute to the development of this important area in natural language processing and code generation.</sample>

    <sample id="361">Armineh Nourbakhsh presents "CounterComp," a method to improve compositional generalization in multi-step quantitative reasoning, particularly for question answering tasks involving financial tables. Current neural models struggle with such tasks, often memorizing spurious patterns due to repeated tokens in the input. To address this, CounterComp leverages counterfactual scenarios by mining positive and negative examples from the training set. Positive examples involve interventions that do not alter the output, while negative examples show changes due to interventions. These examples are used to add an auxiliary metric learning loss during training, dynamically adjusting based on the extent of change in the input questions. This approach improves performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples, demonstrating better compositional generalization. Additionally, CounterComp helps the model focus on meaningful tokens in the input that relate to the output operations. The method is applied to state-of-the-art baselines, consistently enhancing their performance, especially for tasks with more than two reasoning steps. This work aims to reduce reliance on costly supervision signals while improving model generalization.</sample>
