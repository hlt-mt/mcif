    <sample id="2">This paper presents LayoutMask, a novel pre-trained model developed by Ant Group to address reading order issues in Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU). Traditional document pre-training models use global 1D positions to represent token order, which can lead to inaccuracies. LayoutMask introduces local 1D positions, which represent in-segment token orders, allowing the model to infer global reading order by integrating 1D and 2D positions with semantic information. This approach enhances text-layout interactions and improves layout representation learning. The model employs two innovative masking strategies: Whole Word Masking, which masks at the word level to challenge the model to use broader context, and Layout-Aware Masking, which increases the likelihood of masking the first and last words of segments to promote cross-segment order learning. Additionally, LayoutMask introduces Masked Position Modeling, a symmetric pre-training objective that involves recovering masked 2D positions, akin to a cloze test, to further enhance spatial and semantic inference. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutMask's local 1D position outperforms global 1D on FUNSD and SROIE datasets, particularly in complex cases like the "Total" entity in SROIE, where traditional methods struggle. This indicates that local 1D positions are more adaptive to varied document layouts.</sample>

    <sample id="6">This work, "Towards Unifying Multi-Lingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization," introduces a novel approach called many-to-many summarization, which integrates multilingual and cross-lingual summarization into a unified framework. The goal is to develop a single summarization model capable of processing documents in any source language and generating summaries in any target language. The authors propose PISCES, a pre-trained model designed to learn language modeling, cross-lingual ability, and summarization through a three-stage pre-training process. This includes meta pre-training, cross-lingual pre-training, and task-specific pre-training. The study compares many-to-many summarization with traditional multilingual and cross-lingual summarization using the WikiLingua dataset, which includes English, French, Hindi, Chinese, Thai, and Turkish. Four models were evaluated: mBART ONE, mBART U-CLS, mBART MLS, and mBART Many-to-Many Summarization. Results indicate that the many-to-many model outperforms others in transferring task knowledge across languages. PISCES surpasses baselines like mBART-50 and mT5, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each training stage. Human studies further validate PISCES's superiority. The paper encourages readers to explore the detailed findings and methodologies presented.</sample>

    <sample id="11">Jack Hessel, a research scientist at AI2, presented a study on humor understanding benchmarks using The New Yorker Caption Contest data. The study explores whether large language models, like those from Google and OpenAI, truly understand humor. While models can generate and explain jokes, their understanding is questionable, as demonstrated by their performance on structured tasks derived from The New Yorker Caption Contest. The contest involves readers submitting captions for cartoons, with editors selecting finalists and a winner through voting. The study operationalized this into three tasks: matching captions to cartoons, ranking caption quality, and generating joke explanations. A CLIP model fine-tuned on annotated data achieved 62% accuracy on the matching task, compared to a 20% baseline, but humans scored 94%. GPT-4, conditioned with human-authored image descriptions, still lagged behind human performance. Human evaluations showed a preference for human-generated explanations over those from GPT-4. The study highlights a significant gap in humor understanding between models and humans, despite advancements in language model capabilities. The dataset and leaderboard are available for further research, encouraging exploration into improving humor comprehension in AI.</sample>

    <sample id="13">The presentation by Daniel Rotem introduces "Finding the SWEET Spot: Analysis and Improvement of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings," conducted in Professor Roy Schwartz's lab at the Hebrew University. The study focuses on adaptive inference methods, specifically Multi Model and Early Exit, to reduce inference time for large language models by leveraging the varying complexity of real-world data. Multi Model involves using multiple models with classifiers, while Early Exit employs classifiers at intermediate layers of a single model. The study highlights the pros and cons of each method, noting that Multi Model is versatile but incurs storage and overhead costs, whereas Early Exit is memory efficient but suffers from shared model parameters leading to conflicting gradients. This phenomenon occurs when classifiers' gradient updates interfere with each other, degrading overall performance. The research compares Early Exit classifiers with Multi Model classifiers, finding the latter outperform the former by an average of 2.3%. To address conflicting gradients, the SWEET method is introduced, which isolates updates to each layer from its subsequent classifier, effectively mitigating the problem. Results show SWEET closes the performance gap between Early Exit and Multi Model, particularly at high inference speeds, and outperforms both methods in certain scenarios. The study underscores the existence of conflicting gradients and presents SWEET as a promising direction for future research in adaptive inference.</sample>

    <sample id="17">This work introduces a novel approach to multimodal relation extraction (MRE) by addressing the challenges of internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation. Traditional relation extraction focuses on text, but in multimodal contexts like social media, additional visual information can provide crucial context. However, not all textual or visual information is beneficial, necessitating fine-grained information pruning. The proposed method employs a Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) principle to refine features by merging visual and textual scene graphs into a unified cross-modal graph (CMG). This CMG undergoes node and edge adjustments guided by GIB to optimize feature relevance. To address information deficiency, the method incorporates multimodal topic information, enriching context through attention-based integration of top-L textual and visual topic keywords. Experiments on a widely used MRE dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms text-based and other multimodal baselines. Ablation studies reveal that both information screening and compensating enhance performance, with scene graphs proving crucial for structural modeling. The effectiveness of internal-information screening and external-information exploitation varies with text-vision relevance: higher relevance benefits more from screening, while lower relevance gains from external information. This approach achieves significant improvements over existing models, offering a balanced strategy of information subtraction and addition for effective multimodal relation extraction.</sample>

    <sample id="19">Zhang Qin, a master's student from Shenzhen University, presented their work "A Survey for Efficient Open Domain Question Answering" at ACL 2023. The study addresses the challenges of open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems, particularly focusing on efficiency in terms of memory usage, inference speed, and performance. ODQA systems typically use a two-stage model involving retrieval and reading, where the retrieval stage encodes questions to search an indexed Wikipedia corpus for evidence, and the reading stage reasons out the answer. The large size of the Wikipedia corpus and the index file poses significant challenges, including high memory requirements and slow inference speeds. The paper explores efficient techniques to overcome these challenges, such as approximate nearest neighbor search for faster evidence retrieval, adaptive computation for efficient reading, and methods like embedding compression and document filtering to reduce index size. Additionally, it discusses model size reduction through lightweight models, parameter sharing, and one-stage models. The study compares various ODQA models, highlighting the trade-offs between retrieval-only, generator-only, and retrieval-reader systems. It concludes with insights on optimizing ODQA systems based on resource constraints and performance goals, and suggests future work on deploying these systems on low-power devices and developing more comprehensive evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="23">The research by Dan Garrette focuses on enhancing text rendering capabilities in text-to-image models, particularly addressing the Imagen model's limitations in accurately depicting text. Imagen uses a T5-XXL encoder to process input text into subword IDs, which are then fed into a diffusion model to generate images. Despite its proficiency in creating complex images, Imagen struggles with rendering simple textual inputs, such as words. This issue stems from the T5 model's reliance on SentencePiece tokenization, which breaks text into subword units, hindering its ability to spell accurately. Experiments revealed that even the largest T5 model achieves less than 70% spelling accuracy, while larger PaLM models perform better but are impractical due to their size and data requirements. ByT5, which processes individual bytes, demonstrates superior spelling accuracy across all scales. The research highlights that T5 struggles most with frequent words, which are often represented by fewer subwords. To improve text rendering, the study augmented Imagen with a ByT5-small model, enhancing spelling accuracy and image generation quality without significantly increasing parameters. However, diffusion model errors can still affect text rendering. Key contributions include the WikiSpell benchmark for text-only models, the DrawText benchmark for text-to-image models, and a strategy for improving spelling by integrating character-aware models.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The paper introduces "LLM-Blender," an ensemble learning framework designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) through pairwise ranking and generative fusion. Developed by a team from AI2 and USC, LLM-Blender addresses the variability in model performance across different input examples, suggesting that relying on a single top-performing model may not be optimal. Instead, the framework proposes using multiple models to generate outputs, which are then ranked using a pairwise comparison module called PairRanker. This module evaluates pairs of candidate outputs alongside the input to determine the best-performing model for each specific example. The top-ranked candidates are subsequently fused using a sequence-to-sequence model to produce the final output. The paper highlights the effectiveness of LLM-Blender by comparing it with existing models, demonstrating superior performance on a newly created dataset, MixInstruct, which includes outputs from 11 open-source LLMs. The results show that LLM-Blender outperforms top models like Open Assistant and Vicuna in a significant percentage of cases. The framework's simplicity and effectiveness make it a promising approach for ensemble learning in LLMs, with the potential to improve output quality by leveraging the strengths of multiple models. The authors also release a unified codebase for further research and evaluation.</sample>

    <sample id="34">Marcos Treviso presents "CREST: A Joint Framework for Rationalization and Counterfactual Text Generation," developed in collaboration with Alexis Ross, Nuno Guerreiro, and André Martins. CREST combines selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation to enhance interpretability and decision-making in text classifiers. The framework consists of a rationalizer model with a trainable masker to produce meaningful rationales, and an editor, a masked language model, to generate counterfactuals by masking parts of the input and prepending the gold label. Human evaluations on IMDB and SNLI datasets show that CREST-generated counterfactuals are more valid and natural than those from MiCE, though manual counterfactuals remain superior. CREST also supports data augmentation and rationalization using both factual and counterfactual examples, improving model performance on in-domain, contrastive, and out-of-domain datasets. The framework's rationales are assessed for plausibility, forward simulability, and counterfactual simulability, with CREST-Rationalization showing higher plausibility and counterfactual simulability. Overall, CREST effectively generates valid, fluent, and diverse counterfactuals, enhancing downstream model performance and providing interpretable explanations focused on contrasting input parts.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The paper "Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation" by Telmo Pessoa Pires and colleagues introduces Language-Specific Layers (LSLs) to enhance multilingual machine translation. Multilingual models offer scalability, speed, and improved performance for low-resource languages but face challenges like limited capacity per language. LSLs aim to increase capacity where needed while maintaining constant inference costs. The approach involves using a regular transformer layer per language, selecting the appropriate sublayer during inference based on the source or target language, thus keeping costs constant.

The authors focus on encoder LSL placement, as initial experiments showed limited benefits in the decoder. They propose a method where each encoder layer has shared, source, and target weights, allowing the model to learn optimal LSL placement. After training, the largest weight determines the layer type, resulting in a hybrid architecture with shared and language-specific layers.

Experiments were conducted on WMT21 news translation data for 10 languages, including European, Asian, and Swahili. The model's performance was evaluated using chrF, spBLEU, and COMET metrics. Results showed significant improvements over baseline models and language adapters, particularly for low-resource languages. Statistical tests confirmed the significance of these improvements in 84 out of 90 translation directions. The paper highlights the effectiveness of LSLs in enhancing multilingual translation while maintaining efficient inference.</sample>

    <sample id="41">This work introduces PeaCoK, a Persona-grounded Commonsense Knowledge Graph, developed to enhance narrative consistency and engagement by representing world-level persona knowledge. PeaCoK comprises approximately 3,800 personas and 40,000 attributes, forming around 100,000 personal inferences. It features 9,200 attributes linked to multiple personas, facilitating rich interconnections. The graph is constructed in three steps: selecting personas from existing commonsense graphs, inducing attributes from knowledge graphs and language models, and annotating relations through a human-AI majority voting scheme, achieving 87% F1 accuracy. PeaCoK aids in training a BART-based knowledge generator, outperforming large-scale pre-trained models like GPT-3 in persona attribute inference tasks. Additionally, PeaCoK enhances narrative modeling in persona-grounded dialogue generation, as demonstrated on the ConvAI2 PersonaChat dataset. By augmenting speaker profiles with relevant PeaCoK facts, the P²Bot model shows improved dialogue fluency, consistency, engagement, and persona expression. Compared to Atomic2020, PeaCoK's persona-centric knowledge has a more positive impact. Human evaluations indicate that shared attributes between speakers enhance dialogue quality, underscoring the importance of interconnected persona knowledge. PeaCoK serves as a reliable resource for training persona knowledge generators and improving narrative modeling, with its paper and GitHub site publicly available.</sample>

    <sample id="50">The presentation introduces DEPLAIN, a new corpus designed for German text simplification at both document and sentence levels. Text simplification aims to enhance comprehension for specific groups, such as individuals with reading difficulties or non-native speakers, by using techniques like lexical substitution, clause deletion, reordering, and word insertion. Existing corpora are limited in size and often rely on error-prone automatic alignments. DEPLAIN addresses these issues with two subcorpora: DEPLAIN-apa, consisting of 483 manually aligned news texts with approximately 13,000 sentence pairs, and DEPLAIN-web, comprising 750 documents from various domains, aligned both manually and automatically, totaling 30,450 sentence pairs. The corpus exhibits diverse simplification transformations, with DEPLAIN-apa featuring more reorderings and word additions, while DEPLAIN-web includes more rephrasings. DEPLAIN serves two primary use cases: evaluating automatic alignment methods and facilitating automatic text simplification. The corpus provides a gold standard for assessing alignment methods, with MASSalign identified as the most effective for German text simplification. Additionally, DEPLAIN supports fine-tuning language models like long-mBART and base mBART for document- and sentence-level simplifications, respectively, offering a new benchmark for future research in automatic text simplification.</sample>

    <sample id="54">This paper, "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare-Class Challenge," explores the detection of cognitive dissonance in language, a phenomenon where beliefs or actions are inconsistent. Cognitive dissonance is significant for understanding disagreement, belief trends, and mental health, particularly in relation to anxiety disorders and extremism. The study addresses the challenge of its rarity in language by creating a large-scale annotated dataset of dissonance relations. Initial classifier performance was poor due to the scarcity of dissonance examples. To improve detection, the authors employed transfer learning and active learning strategies. They transferred weights from related tasks: topic-independent dissonance stance classification (debate) and binary classification of expansion and comparison classes (CE). This approach improved zero-shot performance significantly. The study compared cumulative and iterative model updates, finding cumulative updates to be more effective. A Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy was used to select likely dissonant examples, outperforming other active learning strategies. The PRC strategy, combined with transfer learning, enhanced dissonance detection, achieving an AUC of 0.75. The study also evaluated annotation quality and costs, noting that while PRC was effective, it posed challenges for annotators. Overall, the research demonstrates the efficacy of transfer learning and active learning in improving rare-class detection in cognitive dissonance.</sample>

    <sample id="59">This presentation introduces DrBERT, the first open-source biomedical pre-trained model in French, based on RoBERTa and trained on NACHOS, a dataset of medical web-crawled data. DrBERT addresses the scarcity of specialized models in French for biomedical and clinical domains, which have been predominantly developed in English. The study compares DrBERT with ChuBERT, a model trained on anonymized clinical data from Nantes University Hospital, to evaluate the effectiveness of different data sources. Various models were trained using different data volumes and strategies, including from-scratch and continual pre-training, to determine the optimal data size and source for training specialized models in French. The evaluation involved 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks, comparing DrBERT and ChuBERT against six baseline models, including CamemBERT and PubMedBERT. Results indicate that models perform best on tasks with data similar to their training data, but heterogeneous data sources enhance versatility. From-scratch pre-training generally yielded superior performance, with DrBERT outperforming CamemBERT in nine of the eleven tasks. The study concludes that while specialized data improves performance, it does not scale well.

    <sample id="62">This paper presents a systematic study on knowledge distillation for natural language generation (NLG) with a focus on pseudo-target training, addressing the need for model compression in large language models. The authors, Nitay Calderon, Amir, Subhabrata, and Roi, explore task-specific knowledge distillation across various NLG tasks, including summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, simplification, and style transfer. The study emphasizes realistic, industry-driven setups characterized by medium-resource labeled datasets, abundant unlabeled data, medium-sized models, and a focus on inference time efficiency. The research contrasts with previous works by not only focusing on classification tasks or pre-training but also by considering multiple NLG tasks in practical scenarios. The study involves eight stages, including architectural decisions, pruning impacts, knowledge selection, and state-of-the-art baselines. The main contribution is the exploration of pseudo-targets in sequence-level knowledge distillation, demonstrating the importance of unlabeled data and the benefits of generating multiple, diverse pseudo-targets. The authors introduce a novel technique called joint-teaching, which combines word-level distillation on pseudo-targets generated by both the teacher and the student to mitigate student exposure bias and enhance learning. This approach aims to improve the student model's performance by exposing it to diverse teacher knowledge and enabling self-correction.</sample>

    <sample id="66">The paper "Deep Learning for Mathematical Reasoning" explores the integration of deep learning methods in mathematical reasoning, a core component of human intelligence involving numerical data and language comprehension. The focus is on developing AI and NLP systems capable of solving math problems and proving theorems. The paper highlights the surge in interest in this area, emphasizing tasks that involve arithmetic operations in text and multimodal data, such as images and tables. It categorizes mathematical reasoning into visual and tabular contexts, with geometric problem-solving as a key example. The paper also discusses automated theorem proving, which aims to validate mathematical claims through logical arguments. Recent advancements in neural network architectures, such as sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-tree models, are noted for their ability to handle mathematical reasoning tasks. The paper underscores the role of pre-trained language models (LLMs) in solving math word problems, using techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency to enhance performance. Despite their capabilities, LLMs face challenges in precise mathematical reasoning, which can be mitigated by augmenting them with tools like program-aided LMMs. The paper also addresses the need for more research in low-resource settings and the development of benchmarks for specialized domains. However, it acknowledges ongoing issues with generalization and robustness in reasoning tasks, particularly with large numbers and consistency in mathematical reasoning.</sample>
    <sample id="67">This study investigates interference in multilingual translation models, focusing on how synergy or interference between language pairs affects translation quality. It identifies that severe interference occurs when models are small relative to data size, and highlights the importance of tuning the sampling temperature for optimal performance. The research examines factors such as language similarity, data size, and the number of languages, concluding that language similarity and the number of languages have minimal impact on interference. Experiments using four Transformer architecture variants and 15 languages from WMT demonstrate that interference is more pronounced in parameter-poor settings. The study finds that using a tuned temperature for sampling, particularly values greater than one, can effectively mitigate interference. Results show that modest scaling and calibrated temperature adjustments can significantly reduce interference without specialized algorithms. The findings suggest that while model and data size are critical in managing interference, other factors like language similarity are less influential. The study emphasizes the need for calibrated temperature settings to enhance multilingual translation performance, especially in low-resource language scenarios.</sample>

    <sample id="71">The paper "Resolving Indirect Referring Expressions for Entity Selection" introduces the AltEntities Corpus, a dataset designed to address the challenge of understanding indirect referring expressions in conversational systems. Authored by Javad Hosseini, Filip Radlinski, Silvia Pareti, and Annie Louis, the work focuses on how users naturally select entities using indirect references, such as "the newer one" or "the song that's not energetic," when direct references like names or positions are not suitable. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where users cannot recall exact names, face pronunciation challenges, or wish to express preferences.

The AltEntities Corpus spans three domains: music, books, and recipes, and employs a cartoon completion setup to collect data. It features three speech bubbles: the first sets the dialogue context, the second presents an alternative question, and the third contains an indirect reference filled by annotators. The dataset includes 6,000 alternative questions and 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Background knowledge is provided to annotators to aid in generating these expressions, with varying levels of information available to test model performance.

Experiments with the T5 XL model demonstrate high accuracy (92-95%) when the model has access to the same background knowledge as annotators. Accuracy drops to 82-87% with partially overlapping knowledge and further to 60% with only entity names. The study highlights the potential for improvement in entity understanding and demonstrates domain-generalizability of the models.</sample>

    <sample id="74">The paper introduces Dense-ATOMIC, a densely-connected commonsense knowledge graph built upon ATOMIC, addressing its limitations in knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths. ATOMIC, a large-scale commonsense knowledge base, primarily contains B-to-A links, resulting in sparse multi-hop paths and limited knowledge coverage. Dense-ATOMIC enhances ATOMIC by adding B-to-B, A-to-B, and A-to-A links, thereby increasing the number of multi-hop paths and improving knowledge coverage. The construction of Dense-ATOMIC involves normalizing tail events, training a relation prediction model (Rel-CSKGC), and employing an Intra- and Inter-Cluster Completion Strategy to efficiently infer missing links. Rel-CSKGC leverages RoBERTa for encoding events and MaxPooling for link prediction, avoiding issues related to sparse graph structures and effectively utilizing semantic information. The paper demonstrates that Dense-ATOMIC outperforms traditional methods in both automatic and human evaluations, offering higher knowledge coverage and benefiting the performance of COMET in generating diversified results. Additionally, Dense-ATOMIC shows promise in commonsense reasoning through its extensive multi-hop paths. The paper provides code and a website for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="75">The paper introduces Jointprop, a joint semi-supervised learning framework for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) tasks, developed by Zheng Yandan, Hao Anran, and Luu Anh Tuan. The motivation behind Jointprop is to address the limitations of fully-supervised models, which require extensive labeled data, and semi-supervised models that overlook the interconnections between NER and RE tasks. By exploiting these interconnections, Jointprop aims to improve label alignment and inference accuracy. The framework consists of four main components: span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. Span feature generation involves initializing span and span pair representations using contextualized token representations. Heterogeneous graph construction leverages k Nearest Neighbor graphs to efficiently capture similarity relations among labeled and unlabeled data. Joint label propagation refines pseudo-labels through the graph until convergence, enhancing label quality. Model optimization involves filtering low-confidence pseudo-labels and retraining the classification model with high-confidence labels.

1. **Pretraining Data**: Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which includes political news media such as The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Huffington Post. This data reflects diverse political perspectives.

2. **Language Model Training**: The political biases present in the pretraining data are absorbed by the language models, resulting in models with varying political leanings. For example, GPT-4 is noted to be more liberal compared to other models like BART.

3. **Controlled Experiments**: By further pretraining models on partisan corpora (news and social media divided by political leaning), researchers observe shifts in the models' ideological coordinates. For instance, RoBERTa shows a liberal shift when further trained on a left-leaning Reddit corpus.

4. **Societal Polarization**: Language models pretrained on corpora from different time periods (pre- and post-45th U.S. president) demonstrate increased political leaning away from the center, indicating the models' ability to pick up societal polarization.

5. **Downstream Task Performance**: Language models with different political leanings perform variably on tasks like hate speech detection and fake news detection. Left-leaning models are better at detecting hate speech against minority groups but worse against powerful groups, and vice versa for right-leaning models. This results in fairness issues, as models may marginalize certain groups based on their political biases.

6. **Fairness Implications**: The propagation of political biases through this pipeline raises significant fairness concerns, as deploying biased models could lead to the marginalization of certain political opinions and unchecked hate speech against minority groups. This highlights the dilemma between sanitizing training data to reduce bias and the risk of censorship or exclusion.</sample>
    <sample id="77">This work, a collaboration between Yale University and Microsoft Research, introduces the DeFacto dataset to enhance factual consistency in abstractive text summarization. The dataset comprises human demonstrations and feedback, focusing on improving the factual accuracy of summaries. The study proposes three new natural language generation (NLG) tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. The research utilizes the XSum dataset and initial outputs from the Pegasus model, collecting around 2.5K data points, with 70% containing factual errors. Human annotators provided labels, corrected summaries, and feedback, including instructions, explanations, and evidence. The human-edited summaries achieved higher factuality scores but showed lower textual overlap with reference summaries due to existing errors in the XSum dataset. The study found that fine-tuned and zero-shot large language models effectively used human feedback for summary editing. However, feedback generation remained challenging. The automatic factual error correction task showed that editor models could match baseline performance with less data, and generating explanations improved performance. The DeFacto dataset, with its fine-grained annotations, offers a test bed for these NLG tasks and aids in developing factuality metrics and meta-evaluation. The dataset is available on GitHub, with further details in the accompanying paper.</sample>

    <sample id="82">This paper introduces a novel framework, ULRA (Unsupervised AES by Learning from Rank Aggregation), for Automated Essay Scoring (AES) without relying on labeled data. Traditional AES models require extensive labeled corpora, which are labor-intensive to collect, especially for new essay prompts. Unsupervised AES eliminates this need, offering significant potential for both research and practical applications. Previous unsupervised AES approaches, such as those by Chen et al. (2010) and Zhang and Litman (2021), utilized single heuristic signals like unique terms and word count, respectively, but achieved suboptimal performance due to their limited scope. ULRA addresses this by aggregating multiple heuristic quality signals to create a pseudo-groundtruth for training a neural AES model. The framework comprises a heuristic essay ranking module (HER alpha-shot) that generates partial-order pairs from multiple quality signals, and a Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation Module (DPRA) that aggregates these pairs into unified supervision. A novel Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation loss is designed to manage inconsistencies among signals by assigning learnable confidence weights. Additionally, a Scoring Strategy is proposed to align model predictions with a predefined score range. Experiments demonstrate ULRA's superior performance over existing unsupervised methods in both transductive and inductive settings, though it still lags behind supervised methods due to weaker supervision. ULRA effectively leverages multiple heuristic signals to enhance unsupervised essay scoring.</sample>

    <sample id="84">The paper "PAD-Net: An Efficient Framework for Dynamic Networks" by Shwai He, presented at ACL 2023, addresses the limitations of fully dynamic networks, which, while flexible, often lead to excessive parameter usage. Traditional static networks use fixed parameters, whereas dynamic networks adjust architecture or parameters based on input, exemplified by Mixture of Experts and Dynamic Convolution. However, fully dynamic networks can significantly increase model size, as seen when replacing BERT-Base's feed-forward layers with Mixture of Experts, resulting in a fivefold size increase. The paper explores whether redundant dynamic parameters exist in fully dynamic networks and if a combination of static and dynamic parameters could enhance performance. The hypothesis suggests that fully dynamic networks contain partially dynamic sub-networks with sufficient representation power. To address this, the authors introduce PAD-Net, which partitions parameters into dynamic and static categories, using Iterative Mode Partition to optimize parameter allocation. The framework aims to convert redundant dynamic parameters to static ones, reducing model size and computation without sacrificing performance. Experiments demonstrate that PAD-Net outperforms both static and fully dynamic networks, maintaining fewer parameters and less computation. Ablation studies identify optimal dynamic ratios and scale factors, crucial for accuracy. Compared to network pruning, PAD-Net shows superior performance by preserving static parameters. Future work includes extending PAD-Net to mainstream networks and hardware-friendly structures, and exploring additional parameter modes.</sample>

    <sample id="90">The paper "Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?" by Haneul Yoo explores the potential of using language learners for data annotation in NLP, challenging the traditional reliance on native speakers. The study investigates whether language learners can effectively contribute to annotation tasks, particularly for languages with limited native speakers. The research focuses on English, Korean, and Indonesian, employing tasks from the GLUE benchmark: sentiment analysis, natural language inference (NLI), named entity recognition (NER), and machine reading comprehension (MRC). Learners were categorized into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels using revised CFR criteria, and compared against native speakers. The experiments involved 120 annotation samples divided by difficulty, with learners using additional resources like dictionaries or translation systems. The study found that learners' annotations were nearly as accurate as those of native speakers, especially for simpler tasks and medium difficulty questions. Aggregating learners' labels through majority voting yielded results comparable to native speakers. Training language models on learners' annotations achieved about 95% of the performance of models trained on native speakers' labels, sometimes even surpassing them. The study also observed improvements in learners' language proficiency and vocabulary through the annotation process. This research suggests a novel approach to data construction for low-resource languages, highlighting the feasibility and benefits of involving language learners in NLP annotation tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="94">The paper introduces a novel method, Embedding Marker, designed to protect the copyright of embedding as services, which are built upon large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and PALM. These services are vulnerable to model theft, where attackers can replicate the service by learning from the embeddings provided. To address this, the authors propose a backdoor-based watermarking technique that meets key requirements: applicability to embedding services, non-degradation of embedding utility, covertness, and transferability during model extraction. The method involves two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. Watermark injection uses a trigger set of moderately frequent words to adjust the provided embedding based on the number of triggers in a user's sentence. Copyright verification involves constructing a backdoor dataset and a benign dataset to detect the presence of the watermark in a potentially stolen model by comparing embedding similarities. Experiments on datasets like AG News, MIND, SST2, and Enron Spam demonstrate the method's effectiveness in maintaining high detection performance and embedding utility, while ensuring the watermark's covertness. The paper concludes by inviting discussion on the proposed method.</sample>

    <sample id="100">PromptRank is a data-efficient approach for multi-hop question answering (QA) that combines unsupervised retrieval with a few-shot language model-based reranker. Traditional multi-hop QA systems require extensive training data, which is costly, especially in low-resource domains. PromptRank addresses this by achieving good performance with as few as 128 examples. The method involves two main steps: retrieving candidate chains using TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, and reranking these candidates with a few-shot language model. The scoring function used is the likelihood of the question given the chain, as determined by a language model. Chain prompts are constructed by inserting chain documents into a prompt with an indicator token and an instruction to elicit the model's reasoning ability. Techniques like instruction search, instruction sampling, and temperature scaling are explored to optimize performance. Experiments with GPT2-XL and T5-XL on HotpotQA show that PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and is comparable to state-of-the-art multi-hop dense retrievers. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component. When used with an ELECTRA-Large reader model, PromptRank demonstrates strong downstream multi-hop QA performance, slightly underperforming the best dense retriever by four exact match points. The approach highlights the effectiveness of using language models for few-shot ranking of candidate paths in multi-hop QA.</sample>

These queries often involve multiple constraints or preferences, as illustrated by examples of a zoologist seeking a specific reptile species and a reader looking for historical fiction novels set in France. QUEST comprises over 3,000 entity-seeking queries that require systems to identify relevant entities and document spans corresponding to different query constraints. The dataset is constructed using Wikipedia categories from films, books, plants, and animals, with human annotators paraphrasing and validating queries for fluency and naturalness. Annotators also verify entity relevance and mark document evidence for query constraints. Evaluation involves retrieving multi-answer sets from a large corpus, with performance measured by MRecall@100 and F1 scores. Baseline systems include sparse and dense retrievers, and a T5-based reranker. Results indicate significant room for improvement, particularly for queries involving set intersections and differences, which are notably challenging.

    <sample id="108">This work, a collaboration between Koustav Sinha and colleagues, investigates the robustness of language model acceptability judgments in varying contexts, focusing on the minimal pair paradigm (MPP). Traditional MPP evaluates models by comparing probabilities assigned to acceptable versus unacceptable sentences. However, this approach is limited in assessing models' performance on longer sequences, which is increasingly relevant with the advent of models featuring extended context windows. The study revisits MPP by simulating longer sequences, using datasets like BLiMP and SyntaxGym to create extended sentences with matching grammatical structures. The research explores three scenarios: matching prefixes from the same dataset, mismatched prefixes from different datasets, and unrelated contexts like Wikipedia. Findings indicate that MPP judgments are stable with irrelevant contexts but significantly fluctuate with context from the same dataset, especially when matching grammatical structures. This effect intensifies with longer contexts, suggesting potential impacts on newer models with larger context windows. Further analysis reveals that models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features across sentences, indicating that current MPP evaluations may not fully capture models' abstract knowledge over extended contexts. The study underscores the need for revised evaluation methods to better assess language models' capabilities in handling longer sequences.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The paper "Unnatural Instructions: Tuning Language Models with (Almost) No Human Labor" explores the creation of a diverse dataset for instruction tuning of language models without human intervention. Instruction tuning allows pre-trained models to generalize to new tasks in a zero-shot setting. Traditional methods rely on reformulating existing NLP datasets or collecting and annotating user-generated prompts, both of which have limitations. The authors propose "Unnatural Instructions," a dataset generated automatically using a variant of GPT-3, which produces natural language instructions, inputs, and outputs. The process involves prompting the model with examples from the Super-Natural Instructions dataset to generate new examples and paraphrases, resulting in 64,000 examples and 240,000 when considering paraphrases. The dataset is analyzed for creativity, diversity, and correctness, with over 50% of examples being correct. The utility of Unnatural Instructions is demonstrated by fine-tuning an 11 billion-parameter T5 model, which outperforms T0++ and Tk-instruct across several benchmarks, including Super-Natural Instructions, T0, BIG-Bench Hard, and LMentry. The study concludes that Unnatural Instructions showcases the potential of language models to generate creative and diverse data, offering a faster and cheaper alternative to human annotations.</sample>

    <sample id="114">The paper "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention" from Nanyang Technological University addresses the challenge of reducing the heavy parameters in large language models (LLMs), which are often impractical for deployment due to their size and training demands. The study focuses on optimizing multi-head attention mechanisms, which are crucial for LLMs but contain redundant parameters. Existing methods either homogenize or diversify attention heads, but neither approach efficiently reduces parameters. The authors propose a novel grouped head attention (GHT) method using a divide and conquer strategy. This involves group-constrained training to make intra-group heads similar and inter-group heads distinct, followed by a Voting-to-Stay algorithm to prune redundant heads, retaining only one per group. This approach achieves significant parameter compression, with up to 90% reduction in extreme cases, while maintaining or improving performance. The GHT and its pruned version, GHT-PS, demonstrate improvements in machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling tasks, with substantial parameter compression. The study also highlights the potential of task-specific automatic pruning, inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, suggesting that LLMs can be pruned without performance loss, akin to uninstalling unused apps on a smartphone. This work paves the way for more efficient LLMs tailored to specific tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="118">The paper "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP" addresses the challenge of processing code-switched text, which is prevalent in linguistically diverse communities like India. Traditional multilingual models like mBERT and XLM-R struggle with code-switched tasks such as question answering and sentiment analysis. The authors propose novel Masked Language Model (MLM) techniques tailored for code-switching, introducing SwitchMLM, which focuses on masking switch-points—transitions between languages. Unlike standard MLM, SwitchMLM only masks these transition tokens, but it requires language identification (LID) tags, which are not always available. To address this, the authors introduce FrequencyMLM, a method that assigns LID tags based on negative log likelihood comparisons across monolingual corpora. Additionally, they propose architectural modifications, including residual connections from intermediate layers that encode more switch-point information to the final layer, and an auxiliary LID-based loss to enhance language information encoding. Probing experiments using linear and conditional probing validate that these methods increase switch-point information in intermediate and final layers. The combined approach of SwitchMLM or FrequencyMLM with ResBERT and auxiliary loss outperforms others in sentiment analysis tasks across various language pairs. The study demonstrates that these innovations effectively enhance the handling of code-switched data in NLP models.</sample>

    <sample id="123">Ying and Zhiyang present their research on MultiInstruct, a novel multi-modal instruction tuning benchmark dataset designed to enhance Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Learning via Instruction Tuning. With the rise of large language models, instruction tuning has shown promise in enabling zero-shot task performance by following natural language instructions. However, this approach has predominantly focused on language-only tasks, leaving multi-modal tasks underexplored. To address this gap, the researchers developed MultiInstruct, the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset, comprising 62 diverse tasks across 10 categories, derived from 21 open-source datasets. Each task includes five expert-written instructions.

The study utilizes OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as the base model, employing a sequence-to-sequence format to process various input and output data types. The training dataset includes 53 tasks from 9 groups, with 10,000 instances per task, while the test set comprises the entire common sense reasoning group and additional tasks from VQ and Miscellaneous groups. The researchers evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, Rouge-L, and a newly introduced sensitivity metric, which assesses consistency in model outputs despite variations in instruction wording.

Results indicate that instruction tuning significantly enhances OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks and that transfer learning from natural instruction datasets improves both performance and sensitivity. The study also highlights the benefits of using multiple instructions during fine-tuning. The researchers are expanding MultiInstruct with 150 additional vision-language tasks, which will be released publicly.</sample>
    <sample id="124">The study "Towards Benchmarking and Improving the Temporal Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models" by Tan Qingyu from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba addresses the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Temporal reasoning is categorized into three levels: time-to-time, time-to-event, and event-to-event reasoning. The research highlights that previous studies have primarily focused on time-to-event reasoning, while this work aims to provide a comprehensive analysis across all three levels. A preliminary experiment on year prediction revealed biases in LMs towards the 2000-2020 period, linked to pre-training data frequencies. The study introduces the TempReason dataset, which includes questions across all reasoning levels and spans a broad temporal range. The dataset is evaluated in three settings: Closed Book QA, Open Book QA, and a novel Reasoning QA setting, which provides relevant temporal knowledge for reasoning. To enhance temporal reasoning, the authors propose a training strategy with two components: Temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning. The final model, TempT5, demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in various settings, particularly in Open Book QA and Reasoning QA. However, performance fluctuations across different time periods suggest potential biases due to training data imbalance. The study concludes by proposing the TempReason benchmark and a training paradigm to advance LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities.</sample>

This approach addresses the limitations of CoT prompting, which is effective only for large models like GPT-3 due to their high computational and memory demands. The authors propose using these large models as "teachers" to generate step-by-step solutions for complex tasks, which are then used to fine-tune smaller models, referred to as "students." A novel technique, Diverse Reasoning, is introduced to enhance this teaching process by generating multiple reasoning samples through stochastic temperature sampling, allowing for more robust training of the student models. The method was tested on 12 tasks, showing significant improvements over prompt-based baselines and vanilla fine-tuning, particularly in text-based tasks. Diverse Reasoning notably increased performance, exemplified by a rise from 33% to 55% in Multi Arithmetic tasks. The approach is scalable, with performance improvements achievable through larger datasets, better teacher models, or bigger student models, though these come with trade-offs between development and inference costs. The paper provides extensive analysis and encourages further exploration of this distillation method for transferring emergent abilities to smaller models.</sample>
    <sample id="128">In "The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources," Akshatha and Martin introduce a diagnostic test suite to assess the ability of natural language understanding (NLU) models to integrate knowledge from multiple sources. This work, a collaboration between McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research, addresses the challenge of combining pretraining-time knowledge with inference-time information, crucial for tasks like coreference resolution. The authors propose a coreference resolution task to evaluate models' capacity to utilize both entity-specific and background knowledge. They define three settings: "Background-Pretrain," "Background-Both," and "Background-Inference," to simulate varying availability of knowledge. The study reveals that without task-specific training, models struggle to perform well on KITMUS, often relying on surface cues. However, with task-specific training, models like C2F and BERT4Coref show significant improvement. Despite this, even the best models face challenges in integrating background knowledge provided solely at inference time. The findings highlight the necessity for task-specific training to enhance models' ability to integrate diverse knowledge sources, particularly when background knowledge is not part of the pretraining data. The paper underscores the limitations of current models in handling dynamically changing information, such as new occupations, and suggests further research to improve knowledge integration in NLU tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="135">ABC-Eval is a new dimensional approach for evaluating conversational AI, developed by the Emory NLP Lab and Amazon Alexa AI. It aims to provide a more precise and reliable evaluation of dialogue quality by reducing the subjectivity inherent in human evaluations. Traditional methods, such as Likert scale ratings and pairwise comparisons, assess overall dialogue quality but often lack granularity. ABC-Eval addresses this by explicitly annotating specific behaviors in chat models, such as irrelevance, contradictions, hallucinations, and empathy failures. This method evaluates the frequency of thematic errors, offering a comprehensive view of chat model performance. In an experiment, four state-of-the-art chat models were assessed using ABC-Eval and compared against traditional methods on 100 human-bot conversations. Results showed that ABC-Eval labels had higher inter-annotator agreement and were more predictive of overall conversation quality. For instance, self and partner contradictions explained 5% and 10% of conversation quality, respectively, compared to less than 4% by Likert scores. A stepwise linear regression demonstrated that ABC-Eval metrics collectively explained over 25% of conversation quality, with each metric contributing unique information. In contrast, turn-level Likert metrics explained less and carried less unique information. ABC-Eval's reliable and distinct metrics offer higher resolution evaluation, highlighting areas for improvement in conversational AI, such as common sense violations and irrelevance. This approach is poised to advance the field by providing a meaningful tool for model comparison.</sample>
    <sample id="136">The presentation by Jasivan introduces "FERMAT: An Alternative to Accuracy for Numerical Reasoning," a study conducted with Nafise at the University of Sheffield. The motivation behind this work is to address the limitations of current benchmarks in evaluating numerical reasoning in language models, which are crucial for real-world applications like fact-checking. Existing benchmarks often provide uninformative accuracy scores, failing to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of models in mathematical tasks. FERMAT, a flexible evaluation set, is proposed to address these gaps by focusing on number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependencies. It includes math word problems from Illinois and CommonCore, with varied number representations to test model capabilities. Initial zero-shot evaluations revealed poor performance across models, suggesting that current benchmarks are not representative of real-world needs. Fine-tuning with 200,000 generated examples, crafted by math teachers, showed improved performance, emphasizing the importance of language and mathematical diversity. Further analysis indicated that even with exact training expressions, models did not achieve high accuracy, highlighting the significance of linguistic context. The study concludes that existing benchmarks are inadequate, and FERMAT offers a more informative alternative. It also identifies number encoding and tokenization as areas needing improvement, advocating for diverse training templates to enhance model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="137">The paper "Tell2Design: A Dataset for Language-Guided Floor Plan Generation" introduces a novel task of generating floor plans from natural language instructions, addressing the need for design generation that meets specific user requirements. The authors propose a sequence-to-sequence model using a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, initialized with the T5 language model, to generate structured floor plans from language inputs. The Tell2Design dataset comprises 5,051 human-annotated and 76,000 artificially generated language instructions, each describing the semantics, geometry, and topology of floor plan components. The model treats instructions as input sequences and room bounding boxes as target sequences, effectively handling various instruction lengths. The approach outperforms text-conditional image generation baselines, achieving a Micro IoU of 54 and a Macro IoU of 53, by focusing on salient information from instructions. The study highlights challenges such as strict design constraints, understanding unstructured text, and dealing with ambiguous instructions. A case study shows that while text-conditional image models produce realistic images, they fail to align with specific design requirements. The paper suggests that pre-training on artificial instructions can bridge the language gap, enhancing performance on human-written instructions. This research lays the groundwork for future exploration in language-guided design generation, particularly in the floor plan domain.</sample>

    <sample id="146">This presentation introduces a study on the omission problem in dialogue summarization, a subtask of text summarization focused on creating concise summaries from dialogues. Despite advancements using large-scale pretrained language models, generated summaries often contain factual errors, with omission being a significant issue. The study reveals that approximately 70% of summaries suffer from omissions, indicating a widespread and serious problem. The research analyzes the distribution of omitted information, finding it randomly scattered across dialogue positions, highlighting the challenge of identifying key information. To address this, the study defines an omission detection task, focusing on utterance-level omissions, and introduces the OLDS dataset, which provides high-quality omission labels across five domains. The dataset, built on existing benchmarks, includes diverse candidate summaries generated by various models and strategies, with labels produced automatically and validated through human evaluation. Three baseline frameworks—pair-wise classification, sequence labeling, and pointer network—are explored for omission detection, evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and a word-level omission recall (WR) score. Results show an F1-score around 50%, underscoring the task's difficulty. The study also investigates summary refinement using detected omissions, demonstrating significant performance improvements, suggesting that omission detection and refinement are promising directions for enhancing dialogue summarization quality.</sample>

    <sample id="150">The paper "MEETINGQA: Extractive Question-Answering on Meeting Transcripts" introduces MeetingQA, a novel dataset designed to address the gap in extractive question-answering (QA) for meeting transcripts. Meeting transcripts, often long and domain-specific, contain rich information that is underutilized by existing NLP research focused on summarization and action item extraction. MeetingQA comprises 7.7K questions from the AMI corpus, with 30% unanswerable, 40% multispan answers, and 48% multi-speaker answers. The dataset features diverse question types, including yes/no, opinion-seeking, and rhetorical questions, with 70% of multi-speaker answers containing disagreement. Questions and answers average 12 and 35 words, respectively. The dataset demonstrates high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha of 0.73) and human performance (F1 of 84.6). The study explores various models, including short-context retrieval, single-span, and multi-span QA models, with the latter treating QA as a token classification task. Results show a significant F1 gap between fine-tuned models and human performance, with short-context models slightly outperforming long-context ones. Zero-shot performance reveals a larger gap, though silver data augmentation and larger instruction-tuned models like FLAN-T5 show promise. Error analysis highlights challenges in identifying rhetorical questions and speaker attribution, particularly in zero-shot settings. MeetingQA presents a challenging yet valuable resource for advancing QA models in real-life meeting scenarios.</sample>
    <sample id="152">Frederick Riemenschneider presents advancements in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classical philology, focusing on the development of language models for Ancient Greek and Latin. Despite recent models like Latin BERT and Ancient Greek BERT, limitations exist due to their monolingual nature and lack of robust evaluation. The project aims to address these by creating new models: GreBERTa and GreTa for Ancient Greek, and PhilBERTa and PhilTa as multilingual models. GreBERTa is a RoBERTa-based encoder-only model, while GreTa is an encoder-decoder model based on the T5 architecture. PhilBERTa and PhilTa are multilingual, trained on Ancient Greek, Latin, and English data. A novel pre-training corpus was developed from the Internet Archive, using OCR transcriptions and identifying Greek texts through stop words. Benchmarking was conducted using Universal Dependencies treebanks for Greek and the EvaLatina 2022 dataset for Latin, focusing on part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and lemmatization. Results show that the new models outperform existing state-of-the-art models. The study also explores the behavior of T5 encoders and the impact of multilinguality, finding no significant performance difference between multilingual and monolingual models. The research introduces powerful, native tokenizer-based models and a high-quality pre-training dataset, contributing significantly to classical philology.</sample>
    <sample id="153">In the work "Resolving Ambiguities in Text-to-Image Generative Models," Ninareh Mehrabi and her team at Amazon Alexa AI's Responsible AI team address the challenge of ambiguities in prompts provided to text-to-image models. The study focuses on understanding and mitigating ambiguities to ensure that generated images align with user intentions. The research introduces a pipeline that begins with curating a benchmark dataset based on the LAVA corpus, which encompasses various types of ambiguities. The team proposes a prompt disambiguation framework that employs a language model to either generate clarifying questions or suggest different visual interpretations. Users interact with the system to provide clarifications, resulting in disambiguated prompts. These prompts are then input into text-to-image models to generate images, which are evaluated for faithfulness to user intentions using a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. The findings indicate that the proposed framework effectively reduces ambiguities and enhances the faithfulness of generated images. The automatic evaluation framework aligns well with human evaluations, demonstrating its reliability. The study highlights disparities in resolving different types of ambiguities and underscores the positive impact of disambiguation on image generation fidelity. The paper provides additional insights and discussions, offering a comprehensive approach to addressing ambiguities in text-to-image models.</sample>

    <sample id="157">The paper "Dialogue Summarization with Static-Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph" by Shen Gao and colleagues from Shandong University introduces a novel approach to dialogue summarization, addressing the challenges of distilling salient information from complex, multi-participant dialogues. Traditional methods rely on pre-computed static graph structures using external linguistic tools, which can be unreliable and inflexible. The proposed SDDS model overcomes these limitations by integrating both static and dynamic graph structures. It begins with an Utterance Encoder to convert dialogue utterances into vector representations. Static graphs are constructed using heuristic methods, including Discourse Parsing Graphs, Key Co-occurrence, speaker interaction frequency matrices, and utterance position graphs. These static graphs are then fused using a 1x1 convolutional layer. A Dynamic Graph module, employing a multi-head attention model, captures semantic relationships without pre-computed structures. The fusion of static and dynamic graphs is achieved through a unified graph representation, which is integrated into the summary generation process using a dual cross-attention mechanism. This approach allows for a more adaptable and accurate summarization of dialogues. The model's code and data are available on GitHub, facilitating further research and application.</sample>
    <sample id="158">The presentation by Qipeng Guo from AWS introduces "Dual Cache for Long Document Neural Coreference Resolution," addressing the challenge of identifying and clustering entity mentions in documents. Traditional coreference resolution methods face quadratic complexity in computation and memory due to the need to evaluate all mention pairs. Cache-based methods reduce this to linear complexity by using a fixed-size cache, but suffer from high cache misses in long documents with topic shifts, as Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policies fail to retain globally mentioned entities. To address this, the dual cache system is proposed, comprising a local cache with LRU eviction for local entities and a global cache with Least Frequently Used (LFU) eviction for global entities. The model processes documents from left to right, classifying mentions as new or cached entities, and evaluates their frequency to determine cache placement. Evaluations on benchmarks like LitBank, OntoNotes, and WikiCoref demonstrate that dual cache outperforms baseline methods, especially in book-length documents, by significantly reducing cache misses and maintaining a high performance/cost ratio. The dual cache system effectively balances efficiency and performance, making it a superior solution for long document coreference resolution.</sample>

    <sample id="165">The paper "Abductive Commonsense Reasoning Exploiting Mutually Exclusive Explanations" by Wenting Zhao introduces a novel unsupervised learning method for abductive reasoning, named LiPoR (Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization). Abductive reasoning involves identifying plausible explanations that bridge the gap between a given context and an outcome. Traditional approaches rely on supervised methods requiring annotated plausible explanations, which are often subjective and noisy. The paper addresses the challenge of learning abductive reasoning without supervision by proposing LiPoR, which treats explanations as latent variables and maximizes the marginal likelihood of outcomes given contexts without needing annotated plausibility. To ensure the selection of plausible explanations, LiPoR incorporates a regularizer based on the mutual exclusivity of explanations, enforcing that only one explanation can be true at a time. The method was evaluated on the AlphaNLI dataset, where it outperformed existing zero-shot models and the previous best unsupervised approach, including a GPT-3 baseline, by over 4 absolute points in accuracy. This work demonstrates the feasibility of unsupervised abductive reasoning by leveraging the inherent mutual exclusivity of explanations.</sample>
    <sample id="166">This work introduces a novel "Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Framework" for image retrieval from linguistically complex text, addressing the challenge of retrieving images from long, complex descriptions where images are highly similar. Traditional visual language models, which excel in simpler image-sentence retrieval tasks, struggle with complex text due to their reliance on analogical reasoning akin to System 1 of the Dual-Process Theory. To overcome this, the proposed framework integrates the Divide-and-Conquer strategy with Dual-Process Theory, combining analogical reasoning (System 1) and logical reasoning (System 2). The framework comprises three main components: the Proposition Generator, which decomposes complex text into simple propositions; the Visual-Linguistic Interactor, which performs visual-proposition interactions; and the Neural-Symbolic Reasoner, which integrates reasoning states and results to derive final solutions. The Neural-Symbolic Reasoner includes a negation executor and conjunction operation to handle complex logical operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, NDCR, outperforms existing baselines, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each module. The framework's ability to present intermediate inference states and results highlights its interoperability. The study suggests that neural symbolic calculation could enhance compositional reasoning in large language models, with the Divide-and-Conquer strategy offering a promising approach to complex problem-solving by decomposing tasks into simpler sub-problems.</sample>

    <sample id="169">This paper presents a systematic study on the use of large language models, specifically PaLM, for machine translation. PaLM, a 540 billion-parameter model trained on 780 billion tokens, is evaluated for its translation capabilities using best practices from the machine translation (MT) community. The study compares PaLM's performance against state-of-the-art systems using the latest test sets and metrics, including neural MT metrics and human evaluations via the MQM framework. The research highlights the significant impact of prompting strategies on translation performance, demonstrating that example quality is more crucial than prompt similarity to the source sentence. A 5-shot prompting strategy, where sentences are marked by language, showed minimal differences in performance based on prompt form. Results indicate that while PaLM's fluency is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, it falls short in accuracy, often omitting parts of the source sentence. Despite this, PaLM's translations are notably fluent, with fewer "Style/Awkward" errors compared to other systems. The study concludes that PaLM closely approaches the performance of commercial systems like Google Translate, though specialized systems still hold a substantial advantage. The findings emphasize the importance of selecting high-quality examples for prompting to enhance translation accuracy.</sample>

    <sample id="174">The paper "ArgAnalysis35K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Argument Quality Analysis" introduces a novel dataset designed to address limitations in existing argument quality datasets. ArgAnalysis35K comprises 35,000 argument-analysis pairs, making it the largest dataset in this field. Unlike traditional datasets that often rely on crowdsourcing and cover a limited range of motions, ArgAnalysis35K sources arguments from high-quality debates, expert debaters, and a diverse range of themes. This approach ensures a higher quality and diversity of arguments.

A key innovation is the introduction of "analysis," a concept that combines claims and premises to provide a more comprehensive explanation of arguments. This addition enhances the dataset's utility for natural language processing (NLP) tasks by offering richer context and understanding.

The dataset also incorporates instance-based annotator reliability, allowing for more nuanced use of annotations by considering annotator biases on a per-argument basis. This method improves the reliability of argument quality assessments.

Furthermore, ArgAnalysis35K introduces a relevance model, assigning scores to arguments based on their applicability to various themes. This model acknowledges that arguments can be relevant across multiple contexts, enhancing the dataset's versatility.

Overall, ArgAnalysis35K offers a more diverse, high-quality, and reliable resource for argument quality analysis, with potential applications in NLP and debate analysis.</sample>

    <sample id="179">Melanie Sclar presents research on enhancing Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) through a method called SymbolicToM. ToM involves understanding others' mental states, traditionally assessed via false-belief tasks like the Sally-Anne test. LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-3, struggle with these tasks. SymbolicToM addresses this by using explicit graphical representations to model characters' beliefs and their estimations of others' beliefs. These graphs, such as BBob and BBob,Alice, represent different mental states and are computed for all character combinations up to a predefined ToM level using Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) models. The method allows efficient question answering by transforming belief-based questions into factual ones over these graphs, which are then processed by LLMs.

Experiments demonstrate SymbolicToM's effectiveness across various LLMs, showing significant performance improvements over baseline models, including fine-tuned GPT-3 and Textual Time Travel. In-domain tests on the ToMi dataset reveal substantial accuracy gains, particularly for second-order false-belief questions. Additionally, SymbolicToM's robustness is tested with new datasets designed for story structure and linguistic generalization, where it outperforms supervised models. The method enhances LLMs' out-of-the-box performance, offering interpretable reasoning and maintaining benefits across diverse linguistic contexts. For further details, the paper is recommended.</sample>

    <sample id="181">This paper introduces "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning," addressing the gap in planning for specific goals with constraints, such as "make a chocolate cake," rather than abstract goals like "make a cake." The study defines constrained language planning, where abstract goals are adapted to specific, constraint-laden real-life scenarios. Evaluating large language models' performance in this context revealed unsatisfactory results, particularly in maintaining faithfulness to constraints despite acceptable semantic completeness. The research identifies variability in performance across different constraint categories and proposes an over-generate-then-filter method to enhance script quality. This method involves generating multiple scripts and using a filter model to select those most faithful to constraints, leveraging InstructGPT embeddings and keyword-based rewards. To facilitate training smaller, specialized models, the study employs symbolic knowledge distillation to create the CoScript dataset, comprising 55,000 specific goals with scripts. Quality assurance was ensured through crowd-sourced revisions. The CoScript dataset demonstrates high diversity in constraints and enables smaller models, like T5, to outperform larger models when fine-tuned on this dataset. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of CoScript to advance research in constrained language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="192">Yang Luo presents "CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization," addressing the challenge of designing an optimizer that achieves both fast convergence and low memory usage. Traditional adaptive methods like Adam require significant memory for gradient moment estimates, while memory-efficient methods like Adafactor reduce memory usage but often at the cost of performance. CAME leverages non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to minimize memory requirements and introduces a confidence-guided approach to handle erroneous updates in training deep neural networks. By calculating an instability matrix from the residual between momentum and current updates, CAME adaptively adjusts optimization steps, reducing errors and improving stability. Experiments on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia demonstrate CAME's superior performance over Adam and Adafactor in training large language models such as BERT, GPT-2, and T5. CAME achieves a 3.4% increase in validation accuracy compared to Adafactor and outperforms Adam in pre-training large models with reduced memory costs, especially at larger batch sizes. Additionally, CAME shows comparable downstream task performance to baselines with lower memory usage. The proposed optimizer effectively balances memory efficiency and convergence speed, making it suitable for large batch training and extending the capabilities of existing memory-efficient optimizers.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The paper introduces "Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree for Explainable Question Answering" (RoHT), addressing limitations in current explainable question answering (XQA) methods. Neuro-symbolic methods, which translate questions into formal representations like SPARQL, are limited by incomplete knowledge bases (KBs). Decompose-based methods, using free-text corpora, struggle with natural language diversity. RoHT integrates knowledge from heterogeneous sources by leveraging question decomposition, addressing challenges in determining decomposition granularity and finding optimal solutions. The proposed RoHT framework consists of two stages: building a Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT) to understand a question's structure and conducting probabilistic reasoning over the HQDT. The HQDT represents a complex question as a tree with atomic questions as leaf nodes. Probabilistic reasoning involves scheduling appropriate knowledge sources, executing answers with probabilities, and aggregating top answers. RoHT is evaluated on KQA Pro and Musique datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods. On KQA Pro, RoHT outperforms other KB QA methods and shows substantial gains when integrating Wikipedia as a supplementary text corpus. On Musique, RoHT improves F1 scores over the SOTA method EX(SA) and outperforms TransferNet, highlighting the benefits of explicit decomposition and knowledge integration from both text and KB.</sample>

    <sample id="205">The presentation by Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, explores the propagation of political biases in language models from pretraining data to downstream tasks. Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, including political news media, which introduces inherent social biases. The study investigates how these biases affect language model performance and fairness in NLP applications. By using political questionnaires, the research evaluates the political leanings of language models, revealing that models like GPT-4 are more socially liberal compared to others like BART. Controlled experiments further demonstrate that pretraining on partisan corpora shifts the ideological coordinates of models, with RoBERTa showing a liberal shift when trained on left-leaning data. The study also examines societal polarization by pretraining models on data from before and after the 45th U.S. president, finding increased political leaning post-2017. In downstream tasks like hate speech and fake news detection, models exhibit biases: left-leaning models better detect hate speech against minority groups but struggle with powerful groups, while right-leaning models show the opposite trend. These findings highlight fairness issues, as deploying biased models could marginalize certain groups. The dilemma is between retaining diverse opinions and avoiding bias propagation, akin to navigating between Scylla and Charybdis, underscoring the challenge of achieving neutrality in language model training.</sample>

    <sample id="215">Adam Przepiórkowski's talk focuses on the dependency structure of coordination, comparing different theoretical approaches. Universal Dependencies and Igor Mel'čuk's Meaning-Text Theory both propose asymmetric structures where the first conjunct is the head. The Prague Dependency Treebanks suggest a conjunction-headed approach, while Hudson's Word Grammar supports a multi-headed structure. Przepiórkowski argues for symmetric structures, using the principle of dependency length minimization. This principle suggests that shorter dependencies are preferred, as illustrated by sentence structures where heavy direct objects can be placed after adjuncts without violating grammatical norms. Analyzing the Penn Treebank, Przepiórkowski observes that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, especially when the governor is on the left or absent. This tendency diminishes when the governor is on the right. These findings challenge asymmetric coordination structures and support symmetric ones, emphasizing the role of dependency length in syntactic preferences. The paper provides a novel argument for symmetric coordination structures, supported by statistical analysis and theoretical reasoning.</sample>
    <sample id="217">The paper "Seen to Unseen: Exploring Compositional Generalization of Multi-Attribute Controllable Dialogue Generation" by Weihao Zeng, Lulu Zhao, and Keqing He addresses the limitations of existing dialogue generation models that focus on single attributes, proposing a novel approach for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation. The authors introduce Disentangled Controllable Generation (DCG), which learns attribute concepts from seen values and employs a disentanglement loss to separate different attribute combinations. DCG is built on the DialoGPT framework, incorporating compositional prompt modules to effectively utilize control signals. Two types of prompts are designed: attribute-oriented prompts, which guide the model to focus on specific dialogue information, and task-oriented prompts, which leverage global features for response generation. The combination of these prompts enhances the model's ability to distinguish between attribute value combinations. To evaluate multi-attribute controllability, the authors propose a unified reference-free evaluation framework, MAE, which is tested on two benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness. The results show that DCG outperforms existing baselines in attribute controllability and text equality, particularly for unseen attribute combinations. The study also highlights the importance of task-oriented prompts in improving text equality and the role of disentanglement learning in compositional generalization. The proposed method successfully transforms seen attributes to unseen combinations, confirming its effectiveness and generality across different pre-trained language models.</sample>

The research, conducted by Jia-Huei Ju, Yu-Shiang Huang, Cheng-Wei Lin, and advisors Professors Che Lin and Chuan-Ju Wang, addresses the challenge of mining useful information from these reports, which are highly similar year-over-year. The work introduces a highlighting task to identify key words that signify changes between consecutive reports. The proposed pipeline consists of several stages: document segmentation, relation recognition, and two fine-tuning stages (out-of-domain and in-domain). The relation recognition stage classifies report pairs into three types: highly similar, revised, and mismatched. The model is fine-tuned using the eSNLI dataset for out-of-domain training and revised pairs for in-domain training, employing soft labeling techniques to improve pseudo-label quality. The evaluation uses precision, recall, and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) metrics, demonstrating superior performance on the FINAL dataset and maintaining generalization on eSNLI. The study highlights the potential of the proposed method to enhance information retrieval in financial reports, with future work aimed at improving effectiveness and incorporating additional features.

The study explores how to enable effective transfer learning when models trained on a general corpus like Wikipedia are applied to domain-specific questions, such as those in biomedicine. The authors propose two main strategies: zero-shot and few-shot data interventions. Few-shot methods involve using a small number of target domain examples to generate additional data, improving retriever and reader model performance by 8% and 11%, respectively. Zero-shot techniques focus on controlling interactions among question, answer, and context by varying one while keeping the others fixed, finding that cloze-style questions are easier to curate and that uniform answer distributions are most effective. The study also examines dataset shifts—concept, covariate, and full shifts—using a compatibility measure to map target datasets onto a 2D grid. This analysis reveals that few-shot adaptations benefit all target sets, while zero-shot methods are particularly effective for concept and covariate shifts. The research concludes that specific data interventions can significantly enhance reader performance, with improvements up to 24%, depending on the type of dataset shift.</sample>

    <sample id="227">The paper addresses the challenge of grounded language understanding, which involves mapping natural language expressions to executable plans or programs in specific environments. This capability is crucial for applications like smart assistants, semantic search, and domestic robots. The primary challenge lies in the lack of grounding during the pre-training of language models, which are typically trained on textual corpora without environmental context. This gap complicates the task of generating valid and grammatical plans or programs. The authors propose a novel framework named Pangu, inspired by Chinese mythology, which separates the generation and discrimination tasks. In this framework, a symbolic agent generates candidate plans, while a language model scores and ranks these candidates, focusing on discrimination rather than generation. This approach leverages the language model's strength in discrimination, avoiding issues with plan validity and grammar. The framework is tested on knowledge-based question answering, demonstrating superior performance and sample efficiency across various language models, including BERT, T5, and Codex. Pangu shows strong generalizability and robustness under non-i.i.d settings, outperforming baseline models like ArcaneQA.

    <sample id="229">Gabriella Skitalinskaya and Henning Wachsmuth present their research on detecting improvable claims in argumentative writing, focusing on two tasks: Suboptimal-Claim detection and Claim Improvement Suggestion. The study addresses the challenge of determining when a claim is optimally phrased, using revision-based data from collaborative online debate platforms like Kialo. The research explores how to model the quality of argumentative text by analyzing implicit revision patterns. Four main challenges are identified: Representativity and Reliability, Model Complexity and Architecture, Contextual Information, and Topical and User Bias. The study examines how to compile reliable datasets, select appropriate models, and incorporate relevant contextual information. It also addresses biases in collaborative revision histories. The findings suggest that revision-based data can effectively support the tasks, with modeling the distance between claim versions aiding in detecting suboptimal claims. The impact of contextual information varies depending on the task and specific quality issues. The paper provides a detailed analysis of strategies to tackle these challenges and compares different approaches, highlighting the potential of revision-based data in improving argumentative writing.</sample>

    <sample id="233">The paper "Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation" by Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi introduces a novel approach to Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST), which involves translating spoken language into text in another language in real time. Current SimulST models face challenges such as complex architectures, lengthy training procedures, and the need for multiple models to achieve different latency levels. The authors propose a solution using existing offline Speech Translation (ST) models without retraining or adopting specific architectures for SimulST. Their approach, called Encoder-Decoder Attention (EDAtt), leverages the attention mechanism to decide when to emit partial translations. A word is emitted if the attention is not concentrated on the last λ speech frames, indicating stable information. The paper demonstrates that EDAtt outperforms traditional strategies like Wait-k and Local Agreement when applied to offline models, achieving higher translation quality (measured by BLEU) and lower latency (measured by average lagging and computational-aware lagging). The results show that EDAtt is the fastest strategy when considering actual elapsed time. The authors have made their code and models open source to facilitate reproducibility.</sample>

    <sample id="241">The paper "Human-in-the-loop Evaluation for Early Misinformation Detection: A Case Study of COVID-19 Treatments" by Ethan, Yang Chen, Wei Xu, and Alan Ritter addresses the limitations of current misinformation detection systems on social media. These systems often rely on retrospectively constructed datasets and may suffer from leaked counter-evidence, reducing their effectiveness in real-time misinformation detection. The authors propose a human-in-the-loop framework that integrates human feedback throughout the misinformation detection process, enhancing the system's realism and utility.

The proposed system processes raw tweets to identify check-worthy claims about COVID-19 treatments using a T5 model for claim extraction and ranks these claims by trendiness. Verified claims are then used to flag potential policy violations with a BERT-based stance classification model. The evaluation focuses on early detection, defined as identifying unapproved treatments before they are debunked in news articles, and policy violation verification, where human moderators assess tweets against Twitter's misinformation policies.

The system demonstrates a 65% accuracy in policy violation detection and can confirm 124.2 policy violations per human hour worked. This framework offers a more realistic evaluation of misinformation detection systems, emphasizing the importance of human involvement and providing a consistent method for future research. The work also offers insights into the development and evaluation of such systems from an external perspective.</sample>

    <sample id="245">This study, "A Needle in a Haystack: An Analysis of High-Agreement Workers on MTurk for Summarization," explores a two-step pipeline to identify high-agreement Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers for summarization tasks. The motivation stems from the limitations of automatic metrics and unclear best practices for MTurk recruitment. The pipeline begins with "Qualification Settings," using pre-task qualifications like location and HIT Approval Rate. The first stage, "Qualification Task," evaluates annotators' ability to assess multiple dimensions, categorizing them into gold, silver, bronze, and block types, with only gold and silver passing. This results in 26 qualified workers (13% of 200 participants). The second stage, "Endurance Task," tests capacity for heavy workloads, resulting in 12 workers (6% of 200) who demonstrate high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) compared to experts. The "Reference-based Task" assesses general performance, with 8 out of 12 workers completing all HITs, achieving a Krippendorff's Alpha of 0.534. Baseline MTurk workers, filtered by MACE, show a Krippendorff's Alpha of 0.380, while CloudResearch workers achieve 0.513 but with lower task acceptance. Analysis reveals significant Spearman's correlation between Pipeline and CloudResearch workers, though Pipeline does not ensure correctness training. The study concludes that the pipeline effectively identifies high-agreement workers, offering a cost-effective alternative to CloudResearch, with future work focusing on expanding applications and improving worker quality. Limitations include testing only English summarization and the non-universality of designed questions.</sample>

    <sample id="247">The paper "FACTKG: Fact Verification via Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs" by Jiho Kim from KAIST AI introduces a novel task and dataset for fact verification using knowledge graphs (KGs) as evidence. Unlike existing datasets such as FEVER and VitaminC, which rely on Wikipedia text, and TabFact and InfoTabs, which use tables, FACTKG leverages KGs to provide intuitive and direct evidence for verifying natural language claims. This approach enhances reliability by reducing the need for additional interpretation. The dataset, FactKG, utilizes DBpedia and includes claims in both written and colloquial styles, making it practical for real-world applications like dialogue systems. FactKG supports five types of reasoning: one-hop, conjunction, existence, multi-hop, and negation. The dataset is annotated with two labels: SUPPORTED and REFUTED. Baseline models were developed, including Claim Only baselines and the GEAR model, which uses graph evidence. The GEAR model outperformed all baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of KG-based fact verification. The dataset is available for download, encouraging further research in this area.</sample>

The work focuses on the Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) task, which involves retrieving relevant legal cases from a candidate pool based on a given query document. Two key contributions are highlighted: the IL-PCR dataset and the U-CREAT pipeline. The IL-PCR dataset, a new benchmark for PCR tasks, comprises 7,070 Indian legal cases with an average of 6.775 citations per document, offering a comprehensive test bed for PCR algorithms. It is compared with the COLIEE’21 dataset, noting IL-PCR's larger case pool, longer documents, and richer vocabulary. The U-CREAT pipeline employs unsupervised learning and an event-based approach, demonstrating high retrieval efficiency and generalization across Indian and Canadian legal systems without specific tuning. Event extraction is central to U-CREAT, using dependency parsing to form subject-verb-object triplets representing events. The pipeline processes query and candidate documents to compute an interaction matrix, identifying common events for ranking candidates. Experiments with count-based, transformer-based, and event-based models show that event-based models, particularly the Event Filtered Documents model, significantly outperform baselines like BM25. U-CREAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COLIEE’21 dataset, underscoring its potential for advancing PCR research.</sample>
    <sample id="253">The study "DisorBERT: A Double Domain Adaptation Model for Detecting Signs of Mental Disorders in Social Media" by Mario Ezra Aragón and his team from Mexico and Spain introduces a novel approach to identifying mental health issues through social media analysis. Mental disorders, characterized by distress and disability affecting cognition and behavior, are increasingly discussed online. The research leverages domain adaptation to enhance model performance in detecting these disorders, using BERT as a base model adapted to Reddit and mental health contexts. The approach integrates a lexicon to guide the masking process, focusing on significant words during training. Results from the eRisk datasets demonstrate DisorBERT's balanced precision and recall, outperforming baseline methods. The model's effectiveness is illustrated through its ability to predict contextually relevant words in sentences from Beck's Depression Inventory, showing a bias towards mental disorder-related terms. Visualization tools highlight key text sequences, emphasizing words like "anxious" and "medication" in user posts. DisorBERT surpasses MentalBERT, a model trained on extensive data, in detecting mental health signs. Future work aims to incorporate diverse lexical resources and clinical data to further refine the model's capabilities.</sample>
    <sample id="254">This research presents an "Uncertainty Guided Label Denoising" framework for document-level distant relation extraction (DocRE), addressing the challenge of noise in distantly supervised data. Traditional methods rely on large-scale human-annotated corpora, which are labor-intensive, while recent approaches use distantly supervised data, introducing noise through false-positive pseudo labels. The proposed framework enhances label quality by integrating uncertainty estimation to assess the reliability of model predictions. A pre-denoising DocRE model is trained using both distantly supervised and human-annotated data to generate pseudo labels. To address the issue of overlapping relations, an instance-level uncertainty estimation method is introduced, utilizing Monte Carlo dropout to capture model uncertainty. Dynamic class uncertainty thresholds are proposed to filter out high-uncertainty pseudo labels, replacing original labels with more reliable ones. A multi-phase training strategy iteratively refines the dataset, leveraging distantly supervised data to boost model performance. The framework outperforms existing baselines on public datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in label quality and model accuracy. Key contributions include the uncertainty-guided label denoising framework, instance-level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations, an iterative re-labeling strategy with dynamic thresholds, and notable performance enhancements.</sample>

    <sample id="258">In the video, Chiang Cheng-Han introduces a novel study titled "Can Large Language Models Be an Alternative to Human Evaluation?" The research explores using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate text quality in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, aiming to address the instability and reproducibility issues associated with human evaluations. The study proposes instructing LLMs to rate text samples based on specific attributes such as grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance. The research is pioneering, as no prior work had explored LLMs for evaluation at the time of submission to ACL.

To validate the effectiveness of LLMs in evaluation, the study compares LLM-generated ratings with human evaluations conducted by English teachers, who are considered experts due to their experience in scoring essays. The experiment involves rating stories generated by GPT-2 and those written by humans. Results indicate that while some smaller LLMs do not show a clear preference for human-written stories, two models, Davinci and ChatGPT, align with human evaluators in preferring human-written texts.

The study addresses potential questions regarding the agreement between LLMs and human evaluators, the impact of instruction wording, response sampling methods, and the benefits and costs of using LLMs over human evaluations. The findings suggest that certain LLMs can serve as viable alternatives to human evaluation in specific NLP tasks. Further details and results are available in the full paper, which is accessible for those interested in this innovative approach.</sample>
    <sample id="259">The paper presents "XSemPLR: Cross-Lingual Semantic Parsing in Multiple Natural Languages and Meaning Representations," addressing the challenge of translating user queries from various natural languages into multiple meaning representations like SQL, Lambda Calculus, and FunQL. Existing models are limited in scope, often neglecting languages like Chinese and certain meaning representations. XSemPLR introduces a comprehensive dataset encompassing 9 datasets, 5 tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 languages across 15 language families. The benchmark evaluates six settings: Translate-Test, Monolingual Model, Monolingual Few-shot, Multilingual Model, Cross-lingual Zero-shot, and Few-shot transfer. Analysis reveals that Encoder-Decoder models, such as mT5, outperform others, though multilingual training can improve performance across most languages, with English showing mixed results due to the "Curse of Multilinguality." Cross-lingual transfer shows significant performance gaps, which are reduced with Few-shot settings. Findings indicate that pretraining on English enhances Few-shot performance in target languages, while models like Codex and BLOOM fall short for cross-lingual tasks. XSemPLR provides a unified benchmark, offering insights into multilingual language models' capabilities in cross-lingual semantic parsing.</sample>

    <sample id="263">This work addresses the instability in in-context learning for large language models, particularly in text classification tasks, by systematically investigating and mitigating label biases. Prior research highlights that design choices in in-context examples introduce biases, affecting model predictions. This study introduces a typology of label biases, identifying a new type: domain-label bias, which arises from the influence of task corpus on model predictions. Experiments demonstrate that random in-domain words can significantly bias predictions, unlike random English words. The study categorizes label biases into vanilla-label bias, context-label bias, and domain-label bias. To mitigate these biases, a novel domain-context calibration method is proposed. This method uses random in-domain words as content-free text to estimate and adjust model biases, improving prediction accuracy. Experiments across various datasets and models, including GPT-3, show that domain-context calibration enhances in-context learning performance, particularly in tasks with high domain-label bias. The method outperforms previous calibration techniques by addressing the limitations of using single predefined tokens. The findings underscore the importance of considering domain-specific influences in in-context learning and demonstrate the effectiveness of domain-context calibration in improving model robustness and decision boundaries.</sample>
    <sample id="264">The paper "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation" by Lin Wang addresses the challenges of multimodal text generation, particularly in audio-visual contexts, where data annotation is costly and domain shifts are prevalent. The proposed Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation (TAVT) framework aims to adapt to new multimodal domains with limited labeled data. The framework comprises three components: an audio-visual meta-mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model generator, and counterfactual contrastive learning. The meta-mapper network aligns visual concepts across domains into a unified auditory semantic space, using audio clips from the Flickr dataset clustered via k-means. Learnable tokens, termed visual prefixes, are introduced to enhance semantic alignment between visual content and the audio space. The encoder and generator utilize a transformer-based architecture, incorporating an alpha parameter to evaluate the contribution of different modalities to word generation. The Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCLL) method is proposed to optimize visual-textual alignment without relying on negative samples. The framework is trained using a meta-learning approach similar to MAML, with random domain selection for support and query sets. Experiments on MSVD and MSR-VTT benchmarks demonstrate TAVT's superior performance over state-of-the-art models in both cross-datasets and cross-domain settings, particularly in low-resource domains. Ablation studies confirm the significant impact of audio features on performance enhancement.</sample>

    <sample id="276">This work introduces "IndicMT Eval," a dataset designed to meta-evaluate machine translation (MT) metrics for Indian languages, addressing the gap in evaluating translations from Indian languages to English. The study focuses on five Indian languages: Tamil, Malayalam (Dravidian), and Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati (Indo-Aryan). From the Flores dataset, 200 sentences per language were selected, generating 1,400 candidate translations per language using seven translation models or APIs, totaling 7,000 samples. Bilingual expert annotators evaluated these translations using the MQM framework, marking errors by type and severity, and providing overall scores. The study found that recent MT models like NLLB and Indic Trans performed better than older models. Among evaluation metrics, chrF showed the highest correlation with human scores, but overlap-based metrics generally underperformed. Embedding-based metrics, particularly LabSE and BERTscore with multilingual models, showed better correlations, with MuRIL performing well on average. COMET-metric variants exhibited the highest overall correlations. However, many metrics, including SacreBLEU, displayed a skewed score range, limiting interpretability. Analysis revealed higher correlations with human scores for accuracy errors compared to fluency errors. Fine-tuning the COMET metric with the MQM dataset resulted in IndicCOMET variants that outperformed COMET baselines, demonstrating robustness and zero-shot capabilities on unseen languages. The dataset is publicly available for further research.</sample>

    <sample id="280">This work introduces MultiEMO, an attention-based correlation-aware multimodal fusion framework designed for emotion recognition in conversations (ERC). The framework addresses challenges in ERC, such as the underutilization of multimodal information, poor performance in minority emotion classes, and difficulty distinguishing semantically similar emotions. MultiEMO comprises four key components: unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion, and emotion classification. The novel contributions include VisExtNet, a visual feature extractor that focuses on facial expressions without redundant scene information, and MultiAttn, a multimodal fusion model using bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers to integrate textual, audio, and visual modalities. Additionally, the Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive Loss is introduced to enhance classification of minority and semantically similar emotions. Extensive experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate MultiEMO's state-of-the-art performance, particularly in challenging scenarios. Despite its advancements, limitations include the inability of VisExtNet to distinguish between speakers and irrelevant individuals, the need for large batch sizes with SWFC loss on MELD, and suboptimal performance in minority emotions compared to majority classes. Overall, MultiEMO significantly advances ERC by effectively leveraging multimodal information and addressing key challenges in emotion classification.</sample>
    <sample id="281">The study "When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-driven, Multilingual Exploration" investigates the necessity of context in translation and evaluates how well models handle context-dependent translations. The research, conducted by Kayo Yin and collaborators, addresses the challenge of context in translation, exemplified by the word "mole," which can mean a spy or a birthmark depending on context. Traditional corpus-level metrics like BLEU fail to capture context-dependent translations, prompting the need for targeted evaluation. The study introduces Pointwise Contextual Mutual Information (P-CXMI) to measure context usage at both sentence and word levels, identifying words with high P-CXMI as context-dependent. Analysis of TED talk transcripts translated into 14 languages reveals patterns in context dependency, such as dual pronouns in Arabic and verb forms in various languages. The findings lead to the creation of the Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) tagger, which identifies context-dependent words across five discourse phenomena. Evaluation using MuDA shows that context-aware models outperform context-agnostic ones in certain phenomena like formality and lexical cohesion, though not significantly in others like ellipsis. The study also compares commercial systems, finding DeepL generally more accurate than Google Translate for document-level translation. This research provides a benchmark for document-level machine translation, highlighting areas needing further progress.</sample>
    <sample id="282">This presentation introduces "StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Author-Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing," a novel approach to non-parallel text style transfer at the story and discourse levels, presented at ACL 2023. Traditional studies have focused on token or sentence-level style transfer, such as sentiment or formality, but StoryTrans advances this by addressing the more complex task of story-level style transfer, crucial for imitating an author's unique style. The main challenge lies in replicating author-specific linguistic preferences, including discourse structures and narrative techniques, which are often tied to specific topics, complicating style transfer. To address these challenges, StoryTrans employs a generation model that learns discourse representations from source texts and integrates them with learnable style embeddings to produce target-style texts. A novel training objective is introduced to minimize stylistic features in discourse representations, bringing different text representations closer in latent space, while enhancing content preservation through a two-stage generation process. The first stage involves transferring source text with masked style-specific content keywords, followed by a second stage that incorporates these keywords to complete the text. The training framework includes self-reconstruction, disentanglement, sentence order, and style classifier losses. Extensive experiments on new Chinese and English datasets demonstrate StoryTrans's superior performance in style control and content preservation compared to strong baselines, with style visualization confirming alignment with target styles.</sample>

    <sample id="284">This paper introduces FSUIE, a novel fuzzy span mechanism designed to enhance universal information extraction (UIE) by addressing the limitations of current span-based models. Traditional models rely heavily on precise span boundaries, which can be ambiguous due to multiple reasonable annotation spans. FSUIE proposes a fuzzy span boundary approach, where the span boundary is learned as a continuous distribution of correctness probabilities, represented by R-min and R-max. The correctness function Q and a sampling function convert this distribution into discrete values for fuzzy span loss calculation, incorporating Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) and KL-divergence. To improve attention distribution for span extraction, FSUIE introduces fuzzy span attention (FSA) as a mask function, dynamically adjusting attention span length with an optimizable parameter delta and applying linear decay at boundaries. The model structure includes this layer at the top level, preserving text encoding capabilities. Experiments on named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction demonstrate FSUIE's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on datasets like ACE2004, 2005, ADE, and AST-V2. The ablation study confirms that FSA enhances convergence speed, while fuzzy span loss (FSL) maximizes annotation information utilization, collectively boosting information extraction capabilities. Visualization of attention distribution confirms the model's focus on relevant semantic information, validating the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy span mechanism.</sample>
    <sample id="285">Mingqi Gao from Peking University presents the work "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation Framework." The study addresses factual errors in dialogue summarization, highlighting two main solutions: incorporating factuality-related objectives during training or inference, and designing independent Factual Error Correction (FEC) models. The research identifies flaws in current FEC evaluations, which rely on vague factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE, potentially blurring the distinction between summarization and correction tasks. To improve evaluation, the study proposes using manually annotated reference corrections, which provide valuable training data and enable more accurate performance assessments. A new taxonomy of factual errors is introduced, categorizing errors as content-based (part of speech and dependencies) and form-based (addition, deletion, substitution). The evaluation framework, built on ERRANT, involves alignment, classification, and comparison steps. Experiments reveal that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue datasets enhances performance, as measured by unreliable factuality metrics. The study emphasizes the need for new evaluation methods and suggests combining human-annotated data with synthetic data as a promising approach. Current FEC models face challenges in correcting addition errors and addressing attribute, modality, and link errors.</sample>

    <sample id="296">Valerio Basile presents a collaborative project between the University of Turin and Amazon Alexa focusing on irony detection in natural language processing (NLP). The project challenges the traditional notion of a single "ground truth" in data annotation, emphasizing the complexity of irony as a pragmatic phenomenon. To address this, the team developed the English Perspectivist Irony Corpus (EPIC), comprising 300 short conversations from social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter, collected over 1.5 years. The corpus includes five English varieties, annotated by 74 individuals via the Prolific platform, with each annotator reviewing 200 conversations. The annotation process involved a simple interface asking annotators to label replies as "Ironic" or "Not ironic."

The study revealed significant inter-annotator agreement variations across different demographic dimensions, such as gender, age, and nationality. To model these differences, the team developed perspective-aware models by fine-tuning pre-trained language models on dataset splits based on annotator characteristics. These models demonstrated higher confidence in their predictions compared to gold standard aggregated models, despite no clear performance trends. Further analysis indicated that generational and geographical proximity influenced annotation discrepancies, particularly between annotators from the UK and Ireland. The findings highlight the importance of considering diverse perspectives in NLP tasks, especially in detecting nuanced linguistic phenomena like irony.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The study "From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns: Unveiling Coded Rhetoric with Language Models" explores the use of dogwhistles—terms that convey different messages to in-groups and out-groups—in political rhetoric. Dogwhistles allow speakers to communicate controversial or taboo messages while maintaining plausible deniability. The research develops a typology and glossary of over 340 dogwhistles, focusing on racist, transphobic, and anti-Semitic terms, primarily in the U.S. context. The study examines historical U.S. political speeches, revealing a correlation between the use of racial dogwhistles and the Republican Southern Strategy post-Civil Rights era, noting an association with conservatism. The research evaluates the ability of language models, particularly GPT-3, to identify and surface dogwhistles. While GPT-3 performs well with formal register dogwhistles, it struggles with informal and transphobic terms. The study also investigates how dogwhistles can evade content moderation by analyzing toxicity detection with the Prospective API. It finds that sentences containing dogwhistles are often rated as less toxic compared to those with explicit slurs, highlighting a challenge for automated moderation systems. Overall, the project underscores the importance of understanding dogwhistles in NLP and linguistics, given their role in political influence and the evasion of content moderation.</sample>

    <sample id="299">This work, by Michalis Korakakis and Andreas Vlachos, addresses the challenge of improving the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models by reducing their reliance on shortcuts—spurious correlations between input attributes and labels. Despite achieving state-of-the-art results, NLI models often exploit these shortcuts, leading to poor performance on out-of-distribution adversarial test sets. Traditional shortcut mitigation methods rely on auxiliary models that may not align with the learner's behavior, requiring domain-specific knowledge and additional computational resources. The proposed minimax training method aims to enhance the learner's focus on under-represented "hard" examples that contradict shortcuts in "easy" examples. This is achieved by alternating optimization between the learner, which minimizes task loss, and an auxiliary model, which maximizes the learner's loss by generating example weights. The auxiliary is modeled as a feed-forward network, and the method does not assume specific shortcut types. Evaluation on datasets like MNLI, FEVER, and QQP, along with their adversarial counterparts, shows consistent improvements in out-of-distribution performance while maintaining in-distribution accuracy. The study also explores the effects of pre-training the learner, the size of the auxiliary, and conducts a qualitative evaluation of the learned example weight distribution.</sample>
    <sample id="300">The presentation introduces "interactive dictation," a novel task developed at Semantic Machines in collaboration with Jason Eisner, Adam Pauls, and Sam Thomson. Interactive dictation allows users to dictate and edit documents using natural voice commands, without the need for predefined trigger words. This task addresses the limitations of current speech-to-text systems, which typically support only dictation and require memorization of fixed commands for editing. The system aims to mimic the intuitive interaction between humans, where commands and dictations are seamlessly interleaved. The task is formalized into a four-step process: ASR recognition, segmentation of dictation and commands, normalization of commands, and execution of utterances to achieve the final document state. A new data collection interface was designed to gather a dataset for this task, enabling the creation of a baseline system. This system comprises separate models for each step, with experiments conducted using T5 and GPT-3 architectures. Results indicate a trade-off between runtime and accuracy, with GPT-3 models being more accurate but slower. The research highlights the potential for further advancements in interactive dictation and provides resources for future work.</sample>
    <sample id="302">It is necessary to permute the tokens for the output sequence because, after tagging each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output, the tokens are not in the correct order. The second step of the model predicts a permutation to arrange these tokens into the correct sequence.</sample>
    <sample id="303">The authors recommend that model owners should increase transparency about bias mitigation methods to better understand the origins of positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, and to determine whether these patterns result from excessive value alignment or other anti-stereotyping methods. Without transparency, assumptions cannot be made or further studied.</sample>
    <sample id="304">Minimal-pair unacceptable inputs are sentences that are ungrammatical or unacceptable in terms of stereotypes, used in the minimal pair paradigm to evaluate language models. In this paradigm, a model is shown an acceptable (grammatical) sentence and an unacceptable (ungrammatical) sentence, and the model is expected to assign a higher probability to the acceptable sentence. The work discussed revisits this paradigm by evaluating models on longer sequences, including unacceptable sentences from the same or different datasets, to test the models' acceptability judgments in various contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="305">In the presentation "Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning," Dawei and colleagues critically examine the assumptions and practices in weakly supervised learning (WSL). WSL involves training models using weakly labeled data, which is cheaper but noisier than manually annotated data. The study challenges the common claim that WSL methods can achieve high performance on clean test sets without clean validation data. The research addresses three key questions: the necessity of clean validation data, the required number of clean samples, and optimal utilization of clean samples. Findings reveal that recent WSL methods indeed require clean validation samples to function effectively, with a significant performance drop observed without them. Increasing the number of clean samples enhances performance, but direct fine-tuning on clean data outperforms WSL methods. The study suggests that the performance gains of WSL are often overstated and recommends reporting model selection criteria, comparing WSL with few-shot learning baselines, and considering continuous fine-tuning as a baseline. The code for the study is open-sourced for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim present their research on entity tracking in language models, focusing on the ability of these models to understand and track changes in entity states within a discourse. They highlight the importance of this capability for comprehending longer texts, such as recipes, where entities like ingredients change states through various actions. The study addresses challenges in evaluating entity tracking, such as reliance on pre-training data patterns, heuristic associations, and potential memorization during fine-tuning. To overcome these, they designed a task involving boxes and objects, requiring models to predict box contents after state-changing operations. Their experiments with Flan-T5 and GPT-3/3.5 models using 2-shot in-context learning revealed that most models failed to track entities beyond simple copying, except for text-davinci-003, which showed non-trivial tracking. Further analysis indicated that pre-training on code might enhance entity tracking abilities, as seen in GPT-3.5 models. While smaller models like T5-base could learn tracking through fine-tuning, randomly initialized models could not, underscoring the importance of pre-training. The findings suggest that pre-training on code may be crucial for developing entity tracking capabilities, though the generalizability of these abilities remains uncertain. More results and analyses, including GPT-4 experiments, are available in their paper on arXiv.</sample>

    <sample id="308">The presentation by Jenny, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, introduces the concept of NLPositionality, which examines design biases in datasets and models, particularly in NLP. The research, conducted with collaborators from the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, highlights how NLP technologies can exhibit systematic performance differences across populations due to the positionality of researchers and developers. Positionality refers to the perspectives shaped by demographics, identity, and life experiences, influencing research outcomes. The study investigates whether datasets and models reflect certain positionalities by comparing annotations from diverse users with existing datasets and models using a Pearson's R correlation score. The research framework, NLPositionality, involves re-annotating datasets with diverse annotators to capture a wide range of demographic data. The study utilized the Lab in the Wild platform to gather over 16,000 annotations from 1,000 annotators across 87 countries. Findings indicate that NLP datasets and models are predominantly aligned with English-speaking countries and individuals with higher education levels, while underrepresenting non-binary individuals. Recommendations include documenting design choices, adopting a perspectivist approach in NLP research, and developing specialized datasets for specific communities, exemplified by the Masakhani initiative. The presentation concludes with an invitation to explore further analysis results and the research paper.</sample>

    <sample id="317">This work introduces "CodeIE," a novel approach to information extraction (IE) that leverages large code generation models to address the challenges of traditional text-to-text models. Traditional IE models, such as T5 and GPT-3, face difficulties in generating structured outputs due to the mismatch between linearized inference outputs and structured pre-training inputs. CodeIE transforms IE tasks into structure-to-structure code generation tasks, utilizing models like Codex to ensure alignment between input and output structures. For Named Entity Recognition (NER), CodeIE employs code-style prompts that define functions to extract entities, facilitating structured output. Similarly, for relation extraction, code prompts are designed to maintain structural integrity. The approach was evaluated on three NER and four relation extraction datasets, comparing T5, UIE, GPT-3, and Codex models. Results showed that CodeIE significantly outperformed traditional models in one to few-shot settings, with lower perplexity and fewer structural errors in code format prompts. Codex demonstrated superior performance over GPT-3, particularly in recall, and consistently avoided label mismatches. This study highlights the potential of code generation models in enhancing IE tasks, offering a promising direction for future research. The paper and code are publicly available for further exploration.</sample>

    <sample id="322">Enrico presents at ACL 23 on the topic "What does a Text Classifier Learn about Morality?" He begins by defining human morality as the internal compass distinguishing right from wrong, essential for societal function. He highlights the challenge of teaching language models to understand morality, noting that morality is subjective and varies across individuals. Enrico introduces the Moral Foundation Theory, which posits five distinct moral foundations that people prioritize differently, influencing their moral judgments. This theory has been applied in NLP to classify morality in text, revealing that language models can partially understand moral concepts.

The paper focuses on using explainable AI to explore how language models interpret morality across different domains. Using the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus, which includes 35,000 tweets from seven domains like #AllLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter, the study examines whether models recognize domain-specific moral expressions. The research finds that models can discern differences, such as the contrasting views on subversion in ALM and BLM, where ALM associates subversion with negative terms, while BLM views it more positively.

The findings suggest that morality is expressed differently across domains, and using a single model for diverse contexts can lead to misunderstandings. This underscores the importance of domain-specific models to accurately interpret moral nuances in text.</sample>
    <sample id="323">This paper introduces DHLK, a novel approach for enhancing Commonsense QA by integrating language models with knowledge representation learning. Addressing the limitations of existing methods, which often introduce noisy entities and lack interaction between text and subgraph modalities, DHLK constructs a Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph (HKG) using a two-stage pruning strategy and Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL). The HKG is built from multiple knowledge bases, including ConceptNet, WordNet, and Wiktionary, and optimized through TransE for entity and relation embeddings. The approach dynamically refines the HKG by removing irrelevant entities based on RoBERTa's attention weights and incorporates paraphrases as additional nodes. A Relation Mask Self-Attention mechanism, inspired by RGAT, models the HKG, updating embeddings through iterative layers. The final graph embedding is obtained via max-pooling, and path information is integrated into the QA context for enhanced representation. The model predicts answers by inputting the HKG graph embedding, path-enhanced QA context, and QA context into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA demonstrate that DHLK outperforms existing LM and HKG methods, leveraging external knowledge bases and KeyBERT for key entity extraction and path retrieval.</sample>

    <sample id="327">This work introduces ManagerTower, a novel vision-language (VL) model architecture designed to enhance the aggregation of insights from uni-modal experts for improved vision-language representation learning. Building on the two-tower architecture, which includes textual, visual, and cross-modal encoders, ManagerTower addresses limitations in previous models like BridgeTower by adaptively aggregating insights from multiple unimodal layers. Unlike BridgeTower, which restricts each cross-modal layer to a single unimodal layer representation, ManagerTower employs managers in each cross-modal layer to dynamically combine insights from various unimodal levels. This approach allows for more effective exploitation of semantic knowledge across different layers, facilitating comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion. The architecture utilizes RoBERTa and CLIP-ViT base as unimodal encoders and demonstrates superior performance on downstream tasks, achieving a 39.15% accuracy on the Wikivideo test standard. ManagerTower's adaptive managers show distinct aggregation weight distributions, highlighting their ability to exploit diverse levels of unimodal semantic knowledge. The model outperforms other base-size models pre-trained on 4 million data and even some models with more data or parameters. The findings underscore the effectiveness of adaptive managers in VL representation learning, with the paper, code, and models available on Archive and GitHub.</sample>

    <sample id="329">This work, presented by Minghang Zheng from Peking University, introduces a novel approach to zero-shot video sentence localization, a task that identifies video segments most relevant to a given natural language query without manual annotations. Traditional methods generate pseudo-events and pseudo-queries, but they often produce overly simplistic queries and fail to ensure irrelevance outside the events, leading to misalignment and label noise. The proposed method, noise-resistant Structured Pseudo-Label (SPL) generation, addresses these issues by using a pre-trained image caption model to create complex pseudo-queries and a pre-trained model to assess frame-query relevance, ensuring high relevance within events and low relevance outside. The method involves dense video frame sampling, pseudo-query generation using the BLIP model, and pseudo-event generation based on event temporal structure. The quality of events is determined by the difference in similarity within and outside the event, selecting the highest quality events. To mitigate label noise, the approach employs sample re-weighting based on model confidence and IoU, and label refinement by using high-confidence predictions as new pseudo-labels. Experiments on ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets demonstrate that the SPL method outperforms existing zero-shot methods across various metrics, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. The code is available for further exploration.</sample>

    <sample id="333">This paper introduces "INK: Injecting kNN Knowledge in Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation," a novel framework designed to enhance the generalization and performance of neural machine translation (NMT) models. The authors, including collaborators from Nanjing University, Shanghai AI Lab, and the University of Hong Kong, address the issue of non-smooth representation spaces in NMT, which lead to poor performance in areas with sparsely dispersed low-frequency tokens. To tackle this, they propose the INK framework, which injects k-nearest neighbor (kNN) knowledge into the NMT model to refine its representation space. The INK training loop involves extracting kNN knowledge from a datastore to guide an adapter in adjusting representations, followed by asynchronously updating the datastore with refined representations. This process continues until convergence, allowing the datastore to be discarded post-training. The framework aligns contextualized representations with token embeddings and kNN token embeddings to enhance semantic meaning and address sparsity. Experiments on the WMT’19 German-English news translation task demonstrate that INK outperforms the state-of-the-art kNN-MT system, achieving an average gain of 1.99 COMET score and 1.0 BLEU score. The results indicate that INK achieves higher BLEU scores with less memory space and faster inference speed, highlighting the benefits of a smoother representation space.</sample>

    <sample id="336">Cross-lingual transfer is the process of training a model on one source language and then transferring it to perform tasks in another language.

    <sample id="337">This research introduces a novel approach for embedding out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words using a Graph-based Relation Mining method. OOV words pose a significant challenge in embedding-based models, impacting their performance. The proposed solution involves leveraging word formation and association to infer the meanings of OOV words, inspired by human learning habits. A Word Relationship Graph is constructed, mimicking lexical rules, where wordpieces of an OOV word are tokenized and associated with relevant words, forming a two-level graph. Each word or wordpiece acts as a node, with embeddings as node attributes. The first layer retains complete wordpiece information, while the second layer samples nodes to reduce noise. A self-attention network assigns attributes to OOV nodes based on their characters. Two levels of Graph Attention Networks are applied to extract important information and reduce noise, with a readout block layer summarizing the graph information. A simple one-layer Graph Convolutional Network captures word formation, and contrastive learning is used in the loss function to align the graph with the background embedding model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior performance over baselines in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, benefiting static and contextual models in downstream tasks. The model's applicability to other languages depends on the rationality of word decomposition, with agglutinative languages being well-suited.</sample>
    <sample id="338">The research titled "Are Human Explanations Always Helpful? Towards Objective Evaluation of Human Natural Language Explanations" explores the evaluation of human-annotated explanations in machine learning models. Conducted by researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research, the study addresses the subjective nature of human explanations and their task-dependent utility. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which focus on word similarity, and the simulatability score, which measures performance changes with explanations, are found inadequate due to their neglect of task differences and explanation utility during fine-tuning and inference.

The study introduces a unified data structure converting various tasks into a multiple-choice format, facilitating the analysis of explanation utility across five datasets: CoS-E, ECQA, e-SNLI, and ComVE. Experiments reveal that fine-tuning with explanations can significantly improve model performance, highlighting the task-dependent nature of explanations. The research proposes a novel metric, TREU, which extends the simulatability score by evaluating explanation helpfulness during fine-tuning. TREU outperforms the simulatability score in reflecting the quality of human explanations, consistently ranking dataset qualities across models T5 and BART.

The findings suggest that human explanations can benefit model predictions even if previously deemed low quality, emphasizing the need for high-quality human collaboration in annotation tasks. The study lays the groundwork for future research in evaluating explanation quality, advocating for similar quality checks in future studies.</sample>

    <sample id="340">This work introduces ParaAMR, a large-scale, syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset created using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) back-translation. Paraphrase generation is crucial for various NLP applications, yet existing datasets are limited in scale and syntactic diversity. ParaAMR addresses these limitations by leveraging AMR graphs, which capture the abstract meaning of sentences. The process involves using a pre-trained AMR parser to generate an AMR graph from a source sentence, altering the focus node, and then using an AMR graph-to-text generator to produce paraphrases. This method ensures semantic similarity while enhancing syntactic diversity. ParaAMR comprises approximately 15 million source sentences, each with an average of 6.9 paraphrases. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that ParaAMR maintains semantic similarity to other back-translation datasets but surpasses them in syntactic diversity. The dataset proves beneficial in several NLP applications: it enhances sentence embeddings in the STS benchmark, improves syntactic control in paraphrase generation, and boosts performance in few-shot learning through data augmentation. Overall, ParaAMR offers a valuable resource for advancing NLP tasks by providing a rich, diverse set of paraphrases. The dataset is publicly available for further research and application.</sample>

    <sample id="342">The paper "LiveChat: A Large-Scale Personalized Dialogue Dataset Automatically Constructed from Live Streaming" introduces a novel dataset aimed at advancing open-domain dialogue research. Open-domain dialogue involves conversational exchanges between humans and AI systems across various topics, typically relying on large-scale text-sourced datasets. However, these datasets lack the richness of real spoken conversations found in video sources. Existing video-sourced datasets are limited by scale and often involve scripted content or manual annotations. To address these limitations, the authors propose LiveChat, a large-scale, video-sourced, personalized dialogue dataset constructed from Chinese TikTok and Douyin streaming videos. The dataset is created through a three-step process: extracting and transcribing audio, matching audience comments to speakers, and collecting persona information for personalized dialogue generation. LiveChat stands out for its scale, personal annotations, and longer average sessions compared to existing datasets. Experiments on response modeling and addressee recognition tasks demonstrate the benefits of persona profiles and longer sessions. The study also explores the performance of pre-trained dialogue models, finding BART to be superior in handling the unique domain of LiveChat. The dataset's distinctiveness is further highlighted by its effectiveness in personalized response learning and the potential for efficient transfer learning of large language models (LLMs). Future work will focus on enhancing LLM transfer learning for LiveChat.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree-based methods include the need to obtain trees, which is often a complicated and computationally expensive process. This typically involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms, such as handling variable symbols, and may require specialized grammar-induction procedures.</sample>
    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a novel approach to compositional generalization in semantic parsing without relying on tree structures. The authors, Matthias Lindemann, Alexander Koller, and Ivan Titov, propose a neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model that directly models correspondences between input and output fragments. The model operates in two steps: first, it tags each input token with an unordered multiset of output tokens, and second, it predicts a permutation to order these tokens correctly. This method avoids the computational complexity and formalism-specific preprocessing required for tree-based models. The permutation model is flexible, allowing for a wide range of possible permutations without hard constraints, and is conceptually similar to solving a "Traveling Salesman" problem, which is approximated using a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation for efficient training. The approach demonstrates strong generalization to deeper recursion on the COGS benchmark, outperforming other treeless models. However, some structural generalization challenges remain. The paper addresses technical challenges such as latent alignments and multiple consistent permutations by inducing alignment during training and learning linguistically plausible permutations. The results highlight the potential of multiset tagging and latent permutations in achieving compositional generalization without trees.</sample>

    <sample id="348">The paper "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models" by Myra, Esin Durmus, and Dan Jurafsky addresses the limitations of current methods for measuring social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches rely on hand-constructed datasets that are time-consuming and often fail to capture intersectional biases. The authors propose a novel method using natural language prompts to generate personas, allowing for the examination of stereotypes across various demographics. By prompting models to describe personas based on specific identity markers, they reveal subtle patterns of bias, such as the depiction of women of color with references to ancestry, unlike their white counterparts.

The method comprises two parts: generating personas and identifying marked words using the sociolinguistic concept of "markedness." This approach highlights specific stereotypes without relying on predefined lexicons. The analysis shows that generated personas contain more stereotypical language than human-written ones, with marked words like "culture" and "exotic" reinforcing harmful narratives. These portrayals often essentialize groups, perpetuating stereotypes like the "Strong Black Women" archetype, which can have negative health impacts.

The authors recommend addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, adopting an intersectional lens in bias research, and increasing transparency in bias mitigation methods. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of biases in LLMs and guide more effective mitigation strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The paper "What’s the Meaning of Superhuman Performance in Today’s NLU?" by Simone Tedeschi and collaborators examines the implications of superhuman performance claims in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks. The authors critique the current leaderboard-based evaluation system, which often leads to systems outperforming humans on tasks like those in SuperGLUE and SQuAD. They highlight issues such as systems being evaluated on full test sets while humans are assessed on smaller subsets, and errors in ground-truth answers that skew comparisons. The paper argues that systems exploit spurious correlations, unlike humans, and that human performance is often underestimated due to vague estimation methods. The authors also point out inconsistencies in pay rates and lack of transparency regarding annotator pools, which can affect the quality of human performance data. These factors contribute to misleading claims of superhuman performance. The paper calls for more rigorous benchmark construction and evaluation methods to ensure fair and meaningful comparisons between human and system performance. Recommendations are provided to address these issues and improve the reliability of NLU benchmarks.</sample>
    <sample id="351">This paper investigates the generalization capabilities of CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers in 2023. The study addresses whether these models, developed nearly two decades ago, can effectively generalize to modern data. To explore this, the authors created the CoNLL++ Dataset, comprising Reuters News articles from 2020 annotated with CoNLL-2003 guidelines. They fine-tuned over 20 models on CoNLL-2003 and evaluated them on both the original test sets and CoNLL++. The percentage change in F1 scores was used to assess generalization.

The research identifies three key factors for good generalization: model architecture, model size, and the number of fine-tuning examples. Transformer models, larger models, and more fine-tuning examples were found to enhance generalization. The study also examined potential causes for performance drops, focusing on adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. Results indicated that adaptive overfitting was not a significant issue, as improvements on CoNLL-2003 translated to greater improvements on CoNLL++. However, temporal drift was confirmed as the primary cause of performance degradation, with larger temporal gaps between training and test data leading to poorer performance.

In conclusion, the paper affirms that CoNLL-2003 taggers still perform well in 2023, provided they incorporate better architectures, larger sizes, and more fine-tuning examples. The findings highlight the need for further research on improving model generalization and emphasize that temporal drift, rather than adaptive overfitting, is the main challenge.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" by Haau-Sing Li et al. addresses the challenge of input underspecification in code generation from natural language descriptions (NLDs). The authors propose an interactive approach to improve code generation by generating clarification questions (CQs) to gather missing specifications. They introduce the task of generating code by asking CQs, focusing on operation-level specifications. The authors create a synthetic dataset, CodeClarQA, which includes clarifications on key operations. They use a method to identify missing key operations by representing key operations and NLDs in latent space and computing similarity scores. If scores are below a threshold, the operation is considered missing. The dataset includes yes-or-no and multiple-choice CQs for missing operations. The paper presents a pipeline for CQ-driven code generation, consisting of a Clarification Need Predictor, a Question Selector, and a Code Generator. Experimental results show that the method effectively identifies missing key operations, with MPNet performing best. The pipeline improves code generation performance, although it underperforms compared to model-only trainers due to the challenge of CQ ranking. The analysis confirms that clarified key operations lead to better code generation, with Oracle CQAs yielding predictions close to the ground truth. The paper highlights the potential of interactive code generation and invites feedback on their approach.</sample>

    <sample id="361">The presentation titled "CounterComp" by Armineh Nourbakhsh introduces a novel approach to enhance compositional generalization in multi-step quantitative reasoning tasks, particularly in question answering involving financial tables. Current neural models struggle with these tasks due to their tendency to memorize spurious patterns, leading to poor performance on outputs requiring more than two arithmetic operations. The proposed solution, CounterComp, leverages counterfactual scenarios to improve model performance by mining positive and negative examples from training data. Positive examples involve interventions in questions that do not alter the output, while negative examples do. These examples are used to introduce an auxiliary metric learning loss with a dynamic margin, which adjusts based on the extent of change in the questions. This method consistently enhances the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, particularly for tasks with more than two reasoning steps. The approach not only improves in-distribution performance but also significantly boosts out-of-distribution generalization, aligning with the goals of compositional generalization. Additionally, CounterComp encourages models to focus on meaningful tokens related to operational terms in the output. This research is supported by co-authors from Carnegie Mellon University and JP Morgan, and further details can be found in the accompanying poster.</sample>
