    <sample id="2">Tu Yi from Ant Group presents a paper on Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU), focusing on understanding documents like forms, receipts, and posters. The paper introduces LayoutMask, a novel pre-trained model addressing reading order issues in document pre-training. Unlike existing models that use global 1D positions, LayoutMask employs local 1D positions, which do not provide cross-segment orders, encouraging the model to infer global reading order using 1D and 2D positions along with semantic information. This approach enhances text-layout interactions and layout representations.

LayoutMask incorporates two new masking strategies in the Masked Language Modeling task: Whole Word Masking and Layout-Aware Masking. Whole Word Masking masks words instead of tokens, challenging the model to use more context for predictions, thus promoting text-layout interactions. Layout-Aware Masking increases the probability of masking the first and last words of each segment, encouraging the model to learn cross-segment orders.

Additionally, LayoutMask introduces a new pre-training objective, Masked Position Modeling, which involves recovering masked 2D positions, similar to a cloze test. This task requires the model to use semantic and spatial clues to infer positions, enhancing text-layout interactions and layout understanding.

Experiments show that LayoutMask's local 1D position outperforms global 1D on FUNSD and SROIE datasets, though slightly behind on CORD, particularly with the "Total" entity. This suggests local 1D is more adaptive to complex layouts. For more details, refer to the full paper and posters.</sample>

    <sample id="6">Jiaan introduces the work "Towards Unifying Multi-Lingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization," a collaborative effort with Fandong, Duo, Yunlong, Zhixu, Jianfeng, and Jie. The paper presents a unified approach called many-to-many summarization, which combines multilingual and cross-lingual summarization into a single model capable of summarizing documents in any source language into any target language. This approach aims to enhance the model's ability to transfer task knowledge across languages more effectively than previous methods.

The team proposes PISCES, a pre-trained many-to-many summarization model, which is trained through a three-stage process: meta pre-training, cross-lingual pre-training, and task-specific pre-training. This model is designed to learn language modeling, cross-lingual abilities, and summarization skills.

The paper compares many-to-many summarization with traditional multilingual and cross-lingual summarization using the WikiLingua dataset, which includes languages like English, French, Hindi, Chinese, Thai, and Turkish. Four models were tested: mBART ONE (individual language models), mBART U-CLS (unified cross-lingual model), mBART MLS (unified monolingual model), and mBART Many-to-Many Summarization. The results indicate that the many-to-many model outperforms others in transferring task knowledge across languages.

PISCES surpasses baselines like mBART-50 and mT5, with ablation studies and human evaluations confirming its effectiveness. The paper encourages readers to explore the detailed findings and methodologies presented.</sample>

    <sample id="11">Jack Hessel, a research scientist at AI2, presented a study on humor understanding benchmarks using The New Yorker Caption Contest. The study, a collaboration with several universities and organizations, explores whether large language models like ChatGPT and Google's PaLM can generate and explain jokes. While these models can create simple jokes, their ability to understand humor is questionable. For instance, when asked to create a knock-knock joke involving a pineapple, ChatGPT's attempt lacked a coherent pun, raising doubts about its humor comprehension.

To systematically evaluate humor understanding, the study utilized The New Yorker Caption Contest data, operationalizing it into three tasks: matching captions to cartoons, ranking caption quality, and generating joke explanations. The best model, CLIP fine-tuned on annotated data, achieved 62% accuracy in matching, compared to humans' 94%. Even when GPT-4 was given human-authored image descriptions, it still lagged behind human performance in matching and quality ranking.

In explanation generation, GPT-4's attempts often contained errors, as shown in a cartoon captioned "He'll be back." Human evaluations preferred human-generated explanations over GPT-4's in over two-thirds of cases. The study highlights the gap between current AI capabilities and human humor understanding, with a dataset and leaderboard available for further research.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presented his work on "Finding the SWEET Spot: Analysis and Improvement of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings," conducted in Professor Roy Schwartz's lab at the Hebrew University. The study focuses on adaptive inference methods, which aim to reduce the inference time of large language models by using low-capacity models for simpler samples. The two primary methods discussed are Multi Model and Early Exit. Multi Model involves using multiple models with classifiers to decide when to halt computation, while Early Exit uses classifiers at intermediate layers of a single model to achieve the same goal. Multi Model is versatile but incurs storage and overhead costs, whereas Early Exit is memory efficient but can suffer from conflicting gradients, where updates from different classifiers interfere with each other, degrading performance. To address this, Rotem introduced SWEET (Separating Weights in Early Exit Transformers), a novel fine-tuning method that trains each layer to receive updates only from its following classifier, thus avoiding conflicting gradients. The results showed that SWEET significantly improved performance, closing the gap between Early Exit and Multi Model, especially at high inference speeds. The study highlights the existence of conflicting gradients in Early Exit and presents SWEET as a promising approach for future research in adaptive inference methods.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student at NUS, introduces their work on multimodal relation extraction (MRE), which addresses the limitations of traditional text-based relation extraction by incorporating visual data. In scenarios like social media, text alone often lacks context, making it difficult to understand ambiguous terms. MRE leverages visual evidence to enhance understanding, such as using images of "Bachelor," "Gown," and "Cap" to infer that JFK graduated from Harvard. However, challenges remain, including internal-information over-utilization, where only parts of the text and visual data are useful, and external-information under-exploitation, where additional context like topic information is needed. To tackle these issues, the team proposes a Graph Information Bottleneck principle-guided feature refinement and integrates multimodal topic information to enrich context. Their framework includes representing text and images as scene graphs, merging them into a unified cross-modal graph (CMG), and refining it through fine-grained filtering and attention-based topic integration. Experiments on a widely used MRE dataset show that their method outperforms text-based approaches and other multimodal baselines. Ablation studies reveal that both information screening and compensating improve performance, with scene graphs aiding structural modeling. The effectiveness of internal-information screening and external-information exploiting varies with text-vision relevance, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing MRE. The proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing models.</sample>

    <sample id="19">Zhang Qin, a master's student from Shenzhen University, presented their work "A Survey for Efficient Open Domain Question Answering" at ACL 2023. The study focuses on improving open-domain question answering systems, which traditionally use a two-stage model involving retrieval and reading. The retrieval stage encodes questions and searches a large Wikipedia corpus to find relevant evidence, while the reading stage processes this evidence to generate answers. Challenges include the large size of the Wikipedia corpus, the substantial index file, and the complexity of language models, which hinder real-time applications and deployment on resource-constrained devices.

The motivation is to create efficient systems with smaller memory costs, faster inference, and comparable performance. The presentation discussed core techniques, including one-stage frameworks like retrieval-only and generator-only systems. Efficient tactics were summarized, such as using approximate nearest neighbor search for faster evidence retrieval, adaptive computation for quicker reading, and methods like document filtering and embedding compression to reduce index size. To reduce model size, strategies like selecting lightweight models, parameter sharing, and designing fewer models were suggested.

Existing models were compared, showing that retrieval and reader systems balance speed, memory, and performance, while retrieval-only systems offer quick inference but large indexes, and generator-only systems have no index but are large and less performant. The study concludes that resource-limited scenarios might benefit from generator-only systems or embedding compression, while retrieval-only systems are suitable for real-time feedback. Future work includes deploying systems on low-power devices and considering more evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Dan Garrette discusses efforts to enhance text rendering in text-to-image models, focusing on the Imagen model. Imagen uses a T5-XXL encoder to process text, which is then input to a diffusion model to generate images. Despite its ability to create high-quality images, Imagen struggles with accurately rendering text. This issue is traced to T5's SentencePiece tokenization, which breaks text into subword IDs rather than individual letters, complicating the rendering of words. Experiments reveal that even large T5 models have low spelling accuracy, with the XXL model achieving under 70%. In contrast, PaLM models, which are larger and trained on more data, perform better but are impractical for many applications. ByT5, which processes individual bytes, shows high spelling accuracy across all scales due to its access to character-level information. Analysis shows T5 struggles most with frequent words, as they are represented by fewer subwords. To improve text rendering, Garrette augmented Imagen with a ByT5-small model, enhancing spelling accuracy and image generation quality. However, errors can still occur during the diffusion process. Key contributions include the WikiSpell benchmark for text models, the DrawText benchmark for text-to-image models, and a strategy to improve spelling by incorporating character-aware models.</sample>

    <sample id="30">The paper introduces "LLM-Blender," an ensemble learning framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages pairwise ranking and generative fusion. Developed by a team from AI2 and USC, the framework addresses the variability in model performance across different input examples. While some models like Vicuna show strong average performance, they are not always the best choice for specific inputs. LLM-Blender proposes using multiple models to generate outputs for a given input, then ranking these outputs using a pairwise ranking module called PairRanker. This module compares pairs of outputs alongside the input using a cross-attention mechanism, such as RoBERTa, to determine which output is better. The top-ranked outputs are then fused by a sequence-to-sequence model to produce the final output. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on a new dataset, MixInstruct, which includes outputs from 11 open-source LLMs. Results show that LLM-Blender outperforms top models like Open Assistant and Vicuna in a significant number of cases. The framework's simplicity and effectiveness make it a promising approach for ensemble learning in LLMs.</sample>

    <sample id="34">Marcos Treviso presents "CREST: A Joint Framework for Rationalization and Counterfactual Text Generation," developed with Alexis Ross, Nuno Guerreiro, and André Martins. CREST combines selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation to enhance interpretability and decision-making in classifiers. The framework includes a rationalizer model with a trainable masker to produce meaningful rationales, which are then used to generate counterfactuals by masking parts of the input and using a masked language model to fill in new tokens. Human evaluations on IMDB and SNLI datasets show that CREST-generated counterfactuals are more valid and natural than those from MiCE, though manual counterfactuals remain superior. CREST also supports data augmentation and rationalization using both factual and counterfactual examples, improving model performance on IMDB and out-of-domain datasets. The framework's rationales are assessed for plausibility, forward simulability, and counterfactual simulability, with CREST-Rationalization showing higher plausibility and counterfactual simulability compared to other methods. Overall, CREST effectively generates valid, fluent, and diverse counterfactuals, enhancing model interpretability and performance.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The paper "Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation" by Telmo Pessoa Pires and colleagues addresses the challenges of multilingual machine translation, such as limited capacity per language and increased training difficulty with larger models. The authors propose Language-Specific Layers (LSLs) to enhance capacity for individual languages without increasing inference costs. LSLs involve using a regular transformer layer per language, activated based on the source or target language during inference, thus maintaining constant inference costs.

The placement of LSLs is optimized by training a large model with shared, source, and target weights for each encoder layer. The model learns the best placement by analyzing weight importance, selecting the largest weight for each layer. This results in a hybrid architecture with shared, source-specific, and target-specific layers.

Experiments were conducted on WMT21 news translation data for 10 languages, including low-resource Swahili. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like chrF, spBLEU, and COMET. Results showed significant improvements over baseline models and language adapters, particularly for low-resource languages, with statistically significant gains in 84 out of 90 translation directions. The approach offers faster inference compared to larger baseline models, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness in multilingual translation tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="41">The work introduces "PeaCoK: Persona Commonsense Knowledge for Consistent and Engaging Narratives," a collaboration between EPFL University and Sony Group Corporation. PeaCoK is a Persona-grounded Commonsense Knowledge Graph designed to enhance narrative systems by representing real-world personas and their interconnections. It includes approximately 3,800 personas, 40,000 attributes, and 100,000 personal inferences, with 9,200 attributes linked to multiple personas, fostering rich interconnections.

PeaCoK was developed in three steps: selecting personas from existing commonsense graphs, inducing attributes from knowledge graphs and language models, and annotating relations using a human-AI majority voting scheme, achieving 87% accuracy. The graph aids language models in learning and generalizing persona knowledge, demonstrated by training a BART-based model on a persona attribute inference task. This model outperformed large-scale pre-trained models like GPT-3 in both automatic and human evaluations.

PeaCoK also improves downstream narrative modeling, particularly in persona-grounded dialogue generation. By retrieving and augmenting speaker profiles with relevant PeaCoK facts, the model enhanced dialogue fluency, consistency, engagement, and persona expression. Compared to the Atomic2020 knowledge graph, PeaCoK's persona-centric knowledge had a more positive impact. Human evaluations showed that shared attributes between speakers led to more consistent and engaging dialogues, underscoring the importance of interconnected persona knowledge in narratives.

    <sample id="50">The presentation introduces DEPLAIN, a new corpus for German text simplification, addressing issues with existing corpora such as size limitations and error-prone automatic alignments. DEPLAIN is divided into two subcorpora: DEPLAIN-apa, with 483 manually aligned news documents resulting in 13,000 sentence pairs, and DEPLAIN-web, with 750 documents aligned both manually and automatically, totaling 30,450 sentence pairs. The corpus features diverse simplification transformations, with DEPLAIN-apa showing more reorderings and word additions, while DEPLAIN-web includes more rephrasings. The corpus is used to evaluate automatic alignment methods, with MASSalign identified as the best for German text simplification. Additionally, DEPLAIN supports automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models like long-mBART for document-level and base mBART for sentence-level simplifications, achieving better scores than baseline models. The results serve as a benchmark for future text simplification research.</sample>

    <sample id="54">The paper "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare-Class Challenge" by Vasudha and colleagues focuses on detecting cognitive dissonance in language, a phenomenon where two beliefs or actions are inconsistent. Cognitive dissonance is significant for understanding disagreement, belief trends, and mental health issues. The study highlights the rarity of dissonance in language, with only 3.5% of annotated discourse pairs showing dissonance. To address this, the authors developed a large-scale annotation resource and employed transfer learning and active learning to improve dissonance detection.

Initially, a classifier trained on a small dataset performed poorly. To enhance performance, the authors transferred weights from related tasks: debate stance classification and binary classification of PDTB's expansion and comparison classes. This transfer learning approach improved zero-shot performance significantly. The active learning process involved two strategies: "Cumulative," which uses all collected data, and "Iterative," which updates the model with the latest data. Cumulative consistently outperformed Iterative.

The authors introduced a Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy to select examples likely to be dissonant, finding it more effective than other strategies. This approach improved dissonance classification AUC to 0.75. While PRC yielded the highest dissonance percentage, annotators found the examples challenging. The study concludes that PRC is effective for rare class acquisition, and transfer learning combined with cumulative updates enhances performance in active learning tasks.</sample>

DrBERT is based on RoBERTa and trained on NACHOS, a dataset of medical web-crawled data. The presentation compares DrBERT with ChuBERT, a model trained on anonymized clinical data from Nantes University Hospital, to explore the effectiveness of different data sources. Various models are trained and compared, including different versions of DrBERT and ChuBERT, as well as models based on CamemBERT and PubMedBERT, to analyze the impact of data size and pre-training strategies. The evaluation involves 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks, comparing the models against six baseline models. Results indicate that models perform best on tasks with data similar to their training data, but heterogeneous data sources enhance versatility. More data generally leads to better performance, with from-scratch pre-training showing higher performance on most tasks. The presentation concludes that DrBERT outperforms generic models like CamemBERT on nine of the 11 tasks, highlighting the benefits of specialized data, though scalability is limited.

    <sample id="62">The paper "A Systematic Study of Knowledge Distillation for Natural Language Generation with Pseudo-Target Training" by Nitay Calderon and collaborators explores model compression for natural language generation (NLG) systems. As large language models become more complex and costly, there is a need to compress these models while preserving performance. The study focuses on task-specific knowledge distillation for NLG, contrasting with previous works that often target classification tasks or use large datasets. The research employs realistic, industry-driven setups with medium-resource labeled datasets and large amounts of unlabeled data, using medium-sized models to achieve high compression rates and inference time efficiency.

The study examines four NLG tasks: summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, and simplification and style transfer, with a labeled to unlabeled data ratio of 1:4. It includes eight stages, exploring architectural decisions, pruning impacts, knowledge selection, and state-of-the-art baselines. The main contribution is the exploration of pseudo-targets in sequence-level knowledge distillation, highlighting the importance of unlabeled data and the benefits of generating multiple, diverse pseudo-targets. The paper introduces a novel technique called joint-teaching, which addresses student exposure bias and teaches the student to correct its own mistakes by applying word-level knowledge distillation on pseudo-targets generated by both the teacher and the student. This approach aims to enhance the student's learning from the teacher's diverse knowledge.</sample>

    <sample id="66">The paper "Deep Learning for Mathematical Reasoning" explores the development of AI and NLP in solving math problems and proving theorems, highlighting the recent surge in interest. Mathematical reasoning involves understanding numerical data and language, extending beyond text to include multimodal information like images and tables. The paper categorizes tasks into visual and tabular contexts, with geometric problem-solving formalized as neuro-symbolic reasoning over diagrams, theorems, and solvers. Automated theorem proving is another focus, aiming to demonstrate the truth of mathematical claims through argument sequences. Recent neural network architectures, such as sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-tree models, have been proposed for these tasks, with the latter modeling tree structures in mathematical expressions. Pre-trained language models (LLMs) have shown promise in solving math word problems by using chain-of-thought processes, which guide models through intermediate reasoning steps. However, LLMs face limitations in precise mathematical reasoning, which can be mitigated by using self-consistency strategies to sample diverse reasoning paths. Program-aided LMMs, like Chameleon, enhance complex reasoning by composing different tools. Despite progress, challenges remain in generalization and robustness, particularly with large numbers and consistency in mathematical reasoning. The paper also notes the underexplored area of mathematical reasoning in low-resource settings and the development of non-English and domain-specific datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="67">Interference in multilingual translation models can either enhance or degrade performance across different language pairs. This study investigates the factors contributing to interference or synergy, identifying that severe interference occurs when models are small relative to data size. Key findings include:

1. **Model and Data Size**: Severe interference is prevalent in small models with large data sizes. Scaling up model and data sizes reduces interference.
2. **Language Similarity and Number of Languages**: These factors have minimal impact on interference. Experiments showed that language similarity does not significantly affect interference levels, even when comparing languages from different families.
3. **Temperature Sampling**: Tuning the sampling temperature is crucial for performance. A calibrated temperature allows for better sampling from lower-resource languages, reducing interference.
4. **Practical Implications**: Modest scaling of model and data sizes, along with tuned temperature sampling, can effectively mitigate interference without specialized algorithms.

The study concludes that while model and data size are critical in managing interference, other factors like language similarity and the number of languages are less influential. Properly calibrated temperature sampling emerges as a key strategy for enhancing multilingual translation performance.</sample>

    <sample id="71">Javad Hosseini and his team introduced the AltEntities Corpus to address the challenge of understanding indirect referring expressions in conversational systems. Their work focuses on how users select between entities using indirect references, such as "the newer one" or "the song that's not energetic," which are more natural in conversation but harder for systems to interpret. The AltEntities Corpus, covering music, books, and recipes, was created using crowd annotation with a cartoon setup. It includes 6,000 alternative questions and 42,000 indirect referring expressions. The dataset was generated by providing annotators with context and background knowledge, such as Google search links for songs or Wikipedia text for books and recipes. The T5 XL model's performance on this dataset shows high accuracy (92-95%) when given the same background knowledge as annotators, but drops to 82-87% with partially overlapping knowledge, and 60% with only entity names. This highlights the need for improved entity understanding in conversational systems.</sample>

This diversity in media types can lead to political biases in language models, which may result in fairness issues in downstream NLP applications. New methods are required to comprehensively evaluate and address these biases across different media types to ensure fair and unbiased language model performance.</sample>

    <sample id="74">The paper introduces Dense-ATOMIC, a densely-connected commonsense knowledge graph built upon ATOMIC, which addresses the limitations of sparse graph structures and insufficient semantic utilization in traditional methods. ATOMIC, a large-scale knowledge base, primarily contains B-to-A links, resulting in limited multi-hop paths and knowledge coverage. Dense-ATOMIC enhances ATOMIC by adding B-to-B, A-to-B, and A-to-A links, thereby increasing multi-hop paths and knowledge coverage. The construction process involves normalizing tail events, training a relation prediction model (Rel-CSKGC), and employing an Intra- and Inter-Cluster Completion Strategy to efficiently infer missing links. Rel-CSKGC predicts relations using RoBERTa-encoded head and tail events, leveraging semantic information without relying on graph structure. The method outperforms traditional relation prediction and translation-based methods in both automatic and human evaluations. Dense-ATOMIC demonstrates higher knowledge coverage and benefits the performance of COMET, generating more diversified results. Evaluations show that Dense-ATOMIC supports extensive multi-hop paths, enhancing commonsense reasoning. The paper provides code and a website for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="75">Zheng Yandan presents "Jointprop," a joint semi-supervised learning framework developed with Hao Anran and Luu Anh Tuan, aimed at improving Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) tasks. The motivation behind this work is to address the limitations of fully-supervised models, which require extensive labeled data, and to leverage the interconnections between NER and RE tasks that are often overlooked. The framework proposes to exploit these connections by propagating labels over heterogeneous graphs, integrating information from both labeled and unlabeled data.

The Jointprop framework consists of four main components: span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. Span feature generation involves initializing representations for spans and span pairs using contextualized token representations. Heterogeneous graph construction creates a k Nearest Neighbor graph to efficiently examine similarity relations among data pairs. Joint label propagation refines pseudo-labels for entities and relations through the graph until convergence. Model optimization involves filtering low-quality pseudo-labels and retraining the classification model with high-confidence labels.

Experiments conducted on four datasets, including joint-task and single-task datasets, demonstrate that Jointprop significantly improves performance over baseline models. The framework benefits from the codependency between NER and RE tasks, showing consistent improvements in both joint and single-task settings.</sample>
    <sample id="76">The political bias propagation pipeline from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks involves several stages:

1. **Pretraining Data**: Language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which includes political news media. This data reflects diverse political perspectives, leading to inherent social biases.

2. **Language Model Training**: The political biases present in the pretraining data influence the language models, causing them to develop varying political leanings. These leanings can be evaluated using political questionnaires and prompt formats grounded in political science.

3. **Bias Evaluation**: Controlled experiments show that further pretraining on partisan corpora shifts the ideological coordinates of language models. Temporal analysis indicates that models trained on data from different time periods reflect societal polarization.

4. **Downstream Task Performance**: Language models with different political leanings perform variably on tasks like hate speech and fake news detection. Their performance is influenced by the political biases they have acquired, leading to fairness issues in NLP applications.

5. **Fairness Implications**: The political biases in language models can result in unfair treatment of different social groups, highlighting the need to address these biases to prevent marginalization and ensure fairness in applications.</sample>
    <sample id="77">The video presents a collaborative research project between Yale University and Microsoft Research on improving factual consistency in text summarization, focusing on a new dataset called DeFacto. This dataset includes human demonstrations and feedback aimed at enhancing the factual accuracy of summaries. The research introduces three new natural language generation (NLG) tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. The study emphasizes the importance of factual consistency, ensuring that all information in a summary is supported by the source document.

The DeFacto dataset was developed using the XSum dataset, with initial summaries generated by the pre-trained Pegasus model. Human annotators evaluated these summaries for factual consistency, providing corrected versions and detailed feedback, including explanations, instructions for corrections, and supporting evidence from the source text. The dataset comprises approximately 2,500 data points, with 70% containing factual errors. Human-edited summaries showed higher factuality scores but lower textual overlap with reference summaries, likely due to existing errors in the reference data.

The research explored three tasks: summary editing, where models use human feedback to correct summaries; feedback generation, where models generate feedback for editors; and automatic factual error correction with explanations. The study found that fine-tuned models and large language models could effectively use human feedback for editing, while feedback generation remained challenging. Training models to generate explanations improved their performance in correcting factual errors. The DeFacto dataset, with its detailed annotations, offers a valuable resource for developing factuality metrics and meta-evaluation tools.</sample>

    <sample id="82">This paper introduces a novel framework, ULRA (Unsupervised AES by Learning from Rank Aggregation), for Automated Essay Scoring (AES) without relying on labeled data. Traditional AES models require extensive labeled corpora, which are labor-intensive to collect, especially for new essay prompts. Unsupervised AES eliminates this need, offering significant potential for both research and practical applications. Previous unsupervised AES approaches, such as those by Chen et al. (2010) and Zhang and Litman (2021), utilized single heuristic signals like unique terms and word count, respectively, but achieved suboptimal performance due to their limited scope. ULRA addresses this by aggregating multiple heuristic quality signals to create a pseudo-groundtruth for training a neural AES model. The framework comprises a heuristic essay ranking module (HER alpha-shot) that generates partial-order pairs from multiple quality signals, and a Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation Module (DPRA) that aggregates these pairs into unified supervision. A novel Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation loss is designed to manage inconsistencies among signals by assigning learnable confidence weights. Additionally, a Scoring Strategy is proposed to align model predictions with a predefined score range. Experiments demonstrate ULRA's superior performance over existing unsupervised methods in both transductive and inductive settings, though it still lags behind supervised methods due to weaker supervision. ULRA effectively leverages multiple heuristic signals to enhance unsupervised essay scoring.</sample>

    <sample id="84">The paper "PAD-Net: An Efficient Framework for Dynamic Networks" by Shwai He, presented at ACL 2023, addresses the limitations of fully dynamic networks, which, while flexible, often lead to excessive parameter usage. Traditional static networks use fixed parameters, whereas dynamic networks adjust architecture or parameters based on input, exemplified by Mixture of Experts and Dynamic Convolution. However, fully dynamic networks can significantly increase model size, as seen when replacing BERT-Base's feed-forward layers with Mixture of Experts, resulting in a fivefold size increase. The paper explores whether redundant dynamic parameters exist in fully dynamic networks and if a combination of static and dynamic parameters could enhance performance. The hypothesis suggests that fully dynamic networks contain partially dynamic sub-networks with sufficient representation power. To address this, the authors introduce PAD-Net, which partitions parameters into dynamic and static categories, using Iterative Mode Partition to optimize parameter allocation. The framework aims to convert redundant dynamic parameters to static ones, reducing model size and computation without sacrificing performance. Experiments demonstrate that PAD-Net outperforms both static and fully dynamic networks, maintaining fewer parameters and less computation. Ablation studies identify optimal dynamic ratios and scale factors, crucial for accuracy. Compared to network pruning, PAD-Net shows superior performance by preserving static parameters. Future work includes extending PAD-Net to mainstream networks and hardware-friendly structures, and exploring additional parameter modes.</sample>

    <sample id="90">The paper "Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?" by Haneul Yoo explores the potential of using language learners for data annotation in NLP, challenging the traditional reliance on native speakers. The study focuses on English, Korean, and Indonesian, using tasks from the GLUE benchmark: sentiment analysis, natural language inference (NLI), named entity recognition (NER), and machine reading comprehension (MRC). Learners were categorized into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels using revised CFR criteria, and compared with native speakers.

The experiment involved 120 annotation samples divided into five difficulty levels. Learners were provided with additional resources like dictionaries or machine translation to aid annotation. The study assessed annotation accuracy and learning effects through a series of tests over six days, including pre-tests, annotation tasks, and post-tests. Results showed that learners' annotations were nearly as accurate as those of native speakers, especially for simpler tasks and medium difficulty questions. Aggregating learners' labels through majority voting further improved accuracy.

Training simulations demonstrated that models trained on learners' annotations achieved about 95% of the performance of those trained on native speakers' labels, sometimes even surpassing them. The study also noted improvements in learners' language proficiency and vocabulary through the annotation process. This research suggests a novel approach to data construction for low-resource languages, highlighting the potential of language learners in NLP research and dataset development.</sample>

    <sample id="94">Jingwei Yi from the University of Science and Technology of China introduces a paper on protecting the copyright of embedding as services through a backdoor watermark method called "Embedding Marker." Embedding as services, built on large language models like GPT, LLAMA, and PALM, are used for various NLP tasks. However, these services are vulnerable to model theft by attackers who can learn from the embeddings and offer similar services. To address this, the paper proposes embedding a watermark in the provider's service to detect unauthorized use.

The watermark method must be applicable to embedding services, not degrade utility, be covert, and transferable during model extraction. Existing methods fall short in these areas. The proposed Embedding Marker involves two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. A trigger set of moderately frequent words is selected, and a target embedding is defined. The provider counts triggers in user sentences, adjusting the provided embedding based on trigger count. If triggers exceed a threshold, the embedding matches the target.

For verification, a backdoor dataset with trigger words and a benign dataset without them are used. The provider requests embeddings from a suspected service, comparing cosine and L2 similarities between requested and target embeddings. The difference in similarities (delta cosine and delta L2) and a KS test p-value are used for detection. Experiments on datasets like AG News and SST2 show high detection performance and utility retention. Visualizations confirm the watermark's covertness, making it difficult to distinguish between backdoor and normal embeddings.</sample>

    <sample id="100">PromptRank is a data-efficient approach for multi-hop question answering (QA) that combines unsupervised retrieval with a few-shot language model-based reranker. Traditional multi-hop QA systems require thousands of examples for training, which is costly, especially in low-resource domains. PromptRank addresses this by achieving good performance with as few as 128 examples. It involves two main steps: retrieving candidate chains using TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, and reranking these candidates with a few-shot language model.

The scoring function used is the likelihood of the question given the chain, as determined by a language model. The chain prompt is constructed by inserting chain documents into a prompt with an indicator token and an instruction like "Read the previous documents and ask a question." This instruction helps elicit the language model's reasoning ability over the documents.

Additional techniques explored include instruction search to find optimal instructions, instruction sampling to aggregate scores from different instructions, and temperature scaling of language model logits. Experiments with GPT2-XL and T5-XL on HotpotQA show that PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and performs comparably to state-of-the-art multi-hop dense retrievers. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component. When used with a reader model like ELECTRA-Large, PromptRank shows strong downstream multi-hop QA performance, slightly underperforming MDR by about four exact match points. The approach highlights the effectiveness of using language models for few-shot ranking of candidate paths in multi-hop QA.</sample>

    <sample id="106">The presentation introduces the QUEST dataset, developed to address complex information retrieval challenges involving queries with implicit set constraints. The dataset is motivated by scenarios like Jane, a zoologist seeking a specific reptile species in Costa Rica, and Austin, a reader looking for historical fiction novels set in France. These examples illustrate how users often express information needs with multiple constraints. QUEST contains over 3,000 entity-seeking queries with implicit set operations, verified answer entities, and documents marked for query constraints. The dataset is constructed using Wikipedia categories from films, books, plants, and animals, with human annotators paraphrasing and validating queries for fluency and naturalness. Annotators also verify entity relevance and mark document evidence for query constraints. Evaluation involves retrieving multi-answer sets from a large corpus, with baselines including sparse and dense retrievers and a T5-based reranker. Initial results show significant room for improvement in retriever performance, particularly for queries involving set intersection and set difference, which are challenging and yield low F1 scores. The dataset aims to help researchers develop better systems for handling selective information needs.</sample>

    <sample id="108">The talk discusses a study on evaluating language models' acceptability judgments using the minimal pair paradigm (MPP), which traditionally assesses models with short, single sentences. The study, a collaboration among several researchers, revisits MPP by testing models on longer sequences to better evaluate their performance with larger context windows. The researchers simulate longer sequences by combining sentences from datasets like BLiMP and SyntaxGym, creating both matching and mismatching contexts. They find that MPP judgments are stable with irrelevant contexts (e.g., Wikipedia) but vary significantly with relevant contexts, especially when prefixes match the grammatical structure being tested. This suggests that models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features across sentences. The study highlights that current MPP evaluations may not fully capture models' abstract knowledge over longer contexts, indicating a need for revised evaluation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="109">The paper "Unnatural Instructions: Tuning Language Models with (Almost) No Human Labor" explores the creation of a diverse dataset for instruction tuning of language models without human intervention. Instruction tuning allows pre-trained models to generalize to new tasks in a zero-shot setting. Traditional methods rely on reformulating existing NLP datasets or collecting and annotating user-generated prompts, both of which have limitations. The authors propose "Unnatural Instructions," a dataset generated automatically using a variant of GPT-3, which produces natural language instructions, inputs, and outputs. The process involves prompting the model with examples from the Super-Natural Instructions dataset to generate new examples and paraphrases, resulting in 64,000 examples and 240,000 when considering paraphrases. The dataset is analyzed for creativity, diversity, and correctness, with over 50% of examples being correct. The utility of Unnatural Instructions is demonstrated by fine-tuning an 11 billion-parameter T5 model, which outperforms T0++ and Tk-instruct across several benchmarks, including Super-Natural Instructions, T0, BIG-Bench Hard, and LMentry. The study concludes that Unnatural Instructions showcases the potential of language models to generate creative and diverse data, offering a faster and cheaper alternative to human annotations.</sample>

    <sample id="114">The presentation introduces research from Nanyang Technological University on optimizing multi-head attention in large language models, focusing on reducing the heavy parameter problem. Large language models, while revolutionary, face challenges such as heavy parameters, long training times, and large data requirements. The research targets the redundancy in multi-head attention, where some heads can be pruned without performance loss. Existing methods either homogenize or diversify attention heads but lack parameter efficiency. The proposed solution, Grouped Head Attention (GHT), uses a divide and conquer strategy with two stages: group-constrained training and a Voting-to-Stay algorithm. Group-constrained training divides heads into groups, making intra-group heads similar and inter-group heads distinct. The Voting-to-Stay algorithm prunes redundant heads, retaining one per group, achieving significant parameter compression. The models, GHT and GHT-PS, show improvements in machine translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling tasks, with substantial parameter compression. The LITE model, a pruned version, offers faster inference and reduced FLOPs. Future work suggests task-specific automatic pruning, inspired by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, to further optimize models by removing unnecessary parameters for specific tasks, akin to uninstalling unused apps on a smartphone. This approach aims to maintain performance while reducing model size and complexity.</sample>

    <sample id="118">The presentation introduces a novel approach to improve pretraining techniques for code-switched NLP, focusing on the common occurrence of code-switching in linguistically diverse communities like India. The research addresses the limitations of multilingual pre-trained models like mBERT and XLM-R in handling code-switched tasks such as question answering and sentiment analysis. The main contributions include the proposal of SwitchMLM, a new Masked Language Model (MLM) technique specifically designed for code-switching. SwitchMLM focuses on masking switch-points, which are transitions between languages, rather than masking all words uniformly. However, this method requires Language Identification (LID) tagged datasets, which are not always available. To address this, a surrogate method called FrequencyMLM is introduced, which uses negative log likelihood to assign LID tags. Additionally, architectural modifications such as residual connections are proposed to enhance switch-point information in BERT's intermediate layers. An auxiliary LID-based loss is also introduced to encourage these layers to encode more language information. The combined method, including SwitchMLM or FrequencyMLM with ResBERT and auxiliary loss, shows superior performance in sentiment analysis tasks across various language pairs. Probing experiments using linear and conditional probing validate the increase in switch-point information in intermediate and final layers, supporting the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</sample>

They highlighted the gap in instructional datasets between NLP and multi-modal tasks, noting the abundance of language-only instruction tasks compared to the scarcity of multi-modal ones. To address this, they developed MultiInstruct, the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning benchmark dataset, comprising 62 diverse tasks across 10 categories, derived from 21 open-source datasets. Each task includes five expert-written instructions.

Their research utilized OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as the base model. They formatted tasks in a sequence-to-sequence manner, unifying input and output data types. For training, they used 53 tasks from 9 groups, sampling 10,000 instances per task, while reserving the common sense reasoning group for testing, along with additional tasks from VQ and Miscellaneous groups. They also included 20 unseen NLP tasks for evaluation.

The study demonstrated that instruction tuning significantly improved OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks and that transfer learning from natural instruction datasets enhanced performance and reduced sensitivity. They introduced a new metric, sensitivity, to measure consistency in model outputs despite variations in instruction wording. Their findings showed that using multiple instructions improved performance and reduced sensitivity. They are expanding MultiInstruct with 150 additional vision-language tasks and plan to release them.</sample>
    <sample id="124">Tan Qingyu from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba presented research on improving the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The study breaks down temporal reasoning into three levels: time-to-time, time-to-event, and event-to-event reasoning. Prior research focused mainly on time-to-event reasoning, but this work aims for a comprehensive approach.

A preliminary experiment on year prediction showed biases in models like T5-L and FLAN-T5-L towards the 2000-2020 period, likely due to pre-training data. ChatGPT performed well on year prediction but struggled with month prediction. To address these issues, the TempReason dataset was proposed, covering all three reasoning levels and a broad temporal range. It includes increased difficulty in L1 questions (e.g., month prediction) and uses Wikidata and Wikipedia for L2 and L3 questions.

Three QA settings were evaluated: Closed Book QA, Open Book QA, and a new Reasoning QA setting, where relevant temporal knowledge is provided. To enhance temporal reasoning, a training strategy with two components was proposed: Temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning.

Experiments on TempReason showed that while ChatGPT's performance dropped significantly in month prediction and other reasoning tasks, models fine-tuned on TempReason, especially TempT5, performed better. TempT5 improved over T5-SFT in Open Book QA and Reasoning QA. However, performance fluctuations across different time periods suggest a need for addressing training data imbalances in future work. The study highlights temporal reasoning biases in LLMs and proposes a benchmark dataset and training paradigm to improve these capabilities.</sample>

    <sample id="127">Namgyu Ho, a master's student at KAIST AI, introduces the paper "Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers," co-authored with Laura Schmid and Se-Young Yun. The paper addresses the challenge of deploying large language models like GPT-3 for complex tasks due to their high memory and computational demands. The authors propose using these large models as "reasoning teachers" to transfer their capabilities to smaller models, making them more practical for deployment. They introduce a novel technique called "diverse reasoning," which involves generating multiple reasoning samples from large models using stochastic temperature sampling. This approach enhances the training of smaller models, enabling them to perform complex reasoning tasks effectively.

The method involves using zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting on large models to generate step-by-step solutions for questions from benchmark datasets. These solutions are then used to fine-tune smaller models. The authors demonstrate that their method, particularly with diverse reasoning, significantly improves performance on various tasks, outperforming existing baselines and vanilla fine-tuning, even with models as small as 0.3 billion parameters.

The paper highlights the scalability of their approach, noting that performance can be further enhanced by using larger datasets, better teacher models, or bigger student models. However, these improvements come with trade-offs between development-time and inference-time costs. The authors provide code and data for their experiments and encourage further exploration of their method.</sample>
    <sample id="128">Akshatha and Martin present their work, "The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources," a collaboration between McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research. The study focuses on natural language understanding (NLU) models that utilize both pretraining and inference-time knowledge. While pretrained parameters provide general knowledge, inference-time inputs offer specific, instance-related information. The authors propose a diagnostic test suite, KITMUS, to evaluate models' ability to integrate these knowledge sources, using a coreference resolution task as a probe.

The task involves identifying the correct referent of a pronoun, requiring both entity-specific and background knowledge. The authors define three settings: "Background-Pretrain," where background knowledge is pretraining-based; "Background-Both," where it's available in both phases; and "Background-Inference," where all knowledge is inference-time only. This last setting tests models' ability to handle new or evolving knowledge not present during pretraining.

Experiments show that without task-specific training, models struggle with KITMUS, relying on surface cues from generic datasets. However, with KITMUS training, models like C2F and BERT4Coref improve significantly. Despite this, even the best models face challenges integrating inference-time-only knowledge. The study highlights the need for task-specific training to enhance models' ability to integrate diverse knowledge sources effectively. Further details, data, and code are available on GitHub.</sample>

    <sample id="135">James Finch and Sarah Finch introduce ABC-Eval, a new method developed by the Emory NLP Lab and Amazon Alexa AI for evaluating conversational AI. ABC-Eval focuses on assessing multiple dimensions of dialogue quality by annotating specific behaviors in chat models, such as relevance, contradictions, and empathy. This approach aims to reduce subjectivity in human evaluations by explicitly marking whether model responses exhibit certain behaviors. The method was tested on four state-of-the-art chat models using 100 human-bot conversations per model. ABC-Eval was compared with existing evaluation methods, including Likert ratings and pairwise comparisons, across eight commonly measured dialogue aspects. The results showed that ABC-Eval labels are more reliable and predictive of overall conversation quality than existing methods, as evidenced by higher inter-annotator agreement and better performance in linear regression analysis. ABC-Eval metrics collectively explained over 25% of conversation quality, with each metric contributing unique information. In contrast, turn-level Likert metrics explained less and carried less unique information. The evaluation revealed that chat models still face challenges, such as common sense violations, irrelevant information, and contradictions. ABC-Eval provides a more precise and informative evaluation framework, which could help advance the field of conversational AI by offering a higher resolution for model comparison.</sample>
    <sample id="136">Jasivan presented "FERMAT: An Alternative to Accuracy for Numerical Reasoning," a study conducted with Nafise at the University of Sheffield. The research addresses the need for accurate numerical reasoning in real-world applications, such as fact-checking, where models must correctly interpret numerical data to classify statements as entailment, contradiction, or neutral. The study highlights that larger language models, with at least 10 billion parameters, perform better in numerical reasoning tasks, but smaller models, around 3 billion parameters, struggle. Current benchmarks, which focus on accuracy and F1 scores, fail to provide detailed insights into models' mathematical capabilities.

To address these issues, the study introduces FERMAT, a flexible evaluation set based on arithmetic types, including number understanding, mathematical operations, and training dependency. FERMAT uses math word problems from Illinois and CommonCore, altering number representations to test model performance across various numerical contexts. Initial zero-shot evaluations showed poor performance across models, suggesting that existing benchmarks are not representative of real-world needs.

The study then involved fine-tuning models using templates created by math teachers, generating 200,000 examples. This approach improved performance across different numerical contexts. The research also explored training dependency, finding that even when models encountered specific expressions during training, their accuracy remained below 50%, indicating that linguistic nuances affect performance.

Finally, the study examined the impact of training templates, showing that incorporating language and mathematical diversity from sources like GSM8K and AQUA improved model performance. The study concludes that existing benchmarks are inadequate and emphasizes the importance of diverse training data and improved number encoding and tokenization.</sample>
    <sample id="137">The paper "Tell2Design: A Dataset for Language-Guided Floor Plan Generation" introduces a novel task of generating floor plans from natural language instructions, focusing on enabling non-experts to participate in the design process. The authors propose a sequence-to-sequence model using a transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, initialized with the T5 language model, to generate floor plans that align with user-specified requirements. The Tell2Design dataset comprises 5,051 human-annotated and 76,000 artificially generated language instructions, each describing the semantics, geometry, and topology of floor plan components. The model treats language instructions as input sequences and room bounding boxes as target sequences, addressing challenges such as strict design constraints, understanding unstructured text, and handling ambiguous instructions. The model outperforms text-conditional image generation baselines, achieving high Intersection over Union (IoU) scores, particularly when artificial instructions are used for pre-training before fine-tuning on human instructions. This approach highlights the benefits of combining artificial and human data during training. The paper concludes by emphasizing the potential of language-guided design generation and the importance of the Tell2Design dataset in advancing research in this area.</sample>

    <sample id="146">Yicheng, a PhD student from Fudan University, discusses a paper on the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization. Dialogue summarization, a subtask of text summarization, involves creating concise summaries from dialogues. Despite advancements using large-scale pretrained language models, these models often produce summaries with factual errors, particularly omissions, which are critical for real-world applications. The paper highlights that about 70% of generated summaries suffer from omissions, indicating a serious issue across various domains. The omitted information is randomly distributed within dialogues, making it challenging for models to identify key information. To address this, the paper introduces the OLDS dataset, which provides high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization across five domains. The dataset includes candidate summaries generated by different models and strategies, with omission labels produced automatically and verified through human evaluation. The paper explores three baseline frameworks for omission detection: pair-wise classification, sequence labeling, and pointer network, using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and a word-level omission recall (WR score) for evaluation. The results show an F1-score around 50%, indicating the task's difficulty. The paper also proposes a post-editing method for summary refinement by incorporating omitted content, which significantly improves summary quality. This approach underscores the importance of omission detection and refinement in enhancing dialogue summarization.</sample>

    <sample id="150">Archiki presents the ACL paper "MEETINGQA: Extractive Question-Answering on Meeting Transcripts," highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities in using meeting transcripts for NLP research. Unlike prior works focused on summarization and action item extraction, MeetingQA addresses the significant QA component in meetings. The dataset, MeetingQA, is based on questions from meeting participants and their corresponding answer sentences, capturing the complexity of real-life discussions. It includes 7.7K questions from the AMI corpus, with 30% unanswerable, 40% with multispan answers, and 48% with multi-speaker answers. The dataset features a variety of question types, including yes/no, opinion-seeking, and rhetorical questions, with 70% of multi-speaker answers containing disagreement. The average length of questions and answers is 12 and 35 words, respectively. The paper reports high human performance (F1 of 84.6) and explores various models, including short-context and long-context models, single-span and multi-span variants, and data augmentation techniques. Results show a significant gap between model and human performance, with short-context models slightly outperforming long-context ones, and single-span models generally performing better than multi-span models. Zero-shot performance also lags behind human performance, though silver data augmentation and larger instruction-tuned models like FLAN-T5 show promise. Error analysis reveals difficulties in identifying rhetorical questions and speaker-specific answers, especially in zero-shot settings. MeetingQA presents a challenging yet promising dataset for advancing QA models in meeting contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="152">Frederick Riemenschneider presented on the intersection of NLP and classical philology, focusing on developing new language models for Ancient Greek and Latin. Despite recent advancements like Latin BERT and Ancient Greek BERT, these models are monolingual and encoder-only, limiting their utility for scholars interested in both languages. To address these limitations, the project introduced GreBERTa and GreTa, monolingual models for Ancient Greek, and PhilBERTa and PhilTa, multilingual models for Ancient Greek, Latin, and English. GreBERTa is a RoBERTa model, while GreTa is an encoder-decoder model based on the T5 architecture. PhilBERTa and PhilTa extend these capabilities to multilingual contexts.

The project gathered pre-training data from Open Greek &amp; Latin and developed a new corpus from the Internet Archive by identifying Greek texts through stop words. This corpus, combined with resources like Corpus Corporum for Latin and English texts related to antiquity, enabled the training of these models. Benchmarking against datasets like Universal Dependencies for Greek and EvaLatina 2022 for Latin showed that the new models outperformed existing ones in tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and lemmatization. Notably, GreTa's encoder-decoder architecture significantly improved lemmatization performance.

The models were also tested for semantic and world knowledge, showing superior performance over previous models. However, no significant difference was found between multilingual and monolingual models in these areas. The presentation highlighted the development of powerful, native tokenizer-based models and introduced a high-quality pre-training dataset for Ancient Greek, with detailed findings available in the accompanying paper.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Ninareh Mehrabi, a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Alexa AI's Responsible AI team, presented research on resolving ambiguities in text-to-image generative models. The study focuses on the challenge of ambiguous prompts, such as "The girl enters the room with flowers," which can be interpreted in multiple ways. The goal is to develop frameworks to mitigate these ambiguities and evaluate the faithfulness of generated images to user intentions.

The research pipeline begins with curating a benchmark dataset based on the LAVA corpus, covering various ambiguity types. A prompt disambiguation framework is then employed, using a language model to either generate clarifying questions or propose different visual interpretations. Users respond to these questions or select the interpretation that aligns with their intention, resulting in a disambiguated prompt.

Disambiguated prompts are input into text-to-image models to generate images, which are then evaluated for faithfulness to user intention using a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. The VQA model assesses whether the generated images satisfy the user's intended interpretation.

Findings indicate that resolving ambiguities improves the faithfulness of image generation, with the automatic evaluation framework aligning well with human evaluations. The research highlights the importance of addressing ambiguities in text-to-image models to enhance their reliability and user satisfaction.</sample>

    <sample id="157">The presentation introduces the "Dialogue Summarization with Static-Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph" model, a collaborative work by Shen Gao and colleagues from Shandong University. Dialogue summarization aims to extract key information from complex dialogues into concise summaries, aiding quick comprehension without reviewing the entire dialogue. Traditional methods rely on pre-computed static graphs using external linguistic tools, which can be unreliable and inflexible for dynamic summarization tasks.

The proposed SDDS model addresses these issues with four main components: an Utterance Encoder, a Static-Dynamic Graph module, and a Summary Generator using a pre-trained language model. The Utterance Encoder converts dialogue utterances into vector representations. The Static-Dynamic Graph module combines static graphs from heuristic methods and a dynamic graph capturing semantic relationships through deep vector representations.

Four heuristic methods model static dialogue structures: Discourse Parsing Graph, Key Co-occurrence for keyword-based relationships, speaker interaction frequency matrix, and utterance position graph using relative distances. These static graphs are fused using a 1x1 convolutional layer. The Dynamic Graph module employs a multi-head attention model to establish semantic relationships without pre-computed structures.

The fusion of static and dynamic graphs into a unified graph integrates dialogue structure information into the summary generation process using a dual cross-attention mechanism. The code and data are available on GitHub.</sample>
    <sample id="158">Qipeng Guo from AWS introduced the "Dual Cache for Long Document Neural Coreference Resolution" work, focusing on the task of coreference resolution, which involves identifying and clustering mentions of the same entity within a document. Traditional methods for this task have quadratic complexity due to the need to evaluate all mention pairs, leading to high computation and memory demands. Recently, cache-based methods have reduced this complexity to linear by using a fixed-size cache, but they face challenges with long documents where topics frequently change, causing high cache misses with the Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy.

To address this, the dual cache system was proposed, consisting of a local cache and a global cache. The local cache uses the LRU policy for local entities, while the global cache employs the Least Frequently Used (LFU) policy for global entities. The model processes the document from left to right, classifying new mentions as either new entities or belonging to existing ones in the cache. Qualified entities are added to the global cache, while others go to the local cache. When caches are full, entities are evicted based on their respective policies.

The dual cache was evaluated on public benchmarks, showing superior performance over baseline methods, especially in long documents like a 30,000-word book. It significantly reduced cache misses compared to single cache methods and demonstrated a high performance/cost ratio, making it a cost-effective solution for coreference resolution in long documents.</sample>

    <sample id="165">Wenting Zhao, a PhD student at Cornell University, presented a paper titled "Abductive Commonsense Reasoning Exploiting Mutually Exclusive Explanations." The paper addresses abductive reasoning, which involves identifying plausible explanations to bridge the gap between a given context and an outcome. Zhao illustrated this with an example: Emily was stuck in traffic (context) and made it to her flight (outcome), with possible explanations being either her flight was delayed or it left on time. The paper challenges the reliance on supervised methods for abductive reasoning, which require annotated plausible explanations that can be subjective and inconsistent. Zhao introduced an unsupervised learning method called LiPoR (Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization) to address this issue. LiPoR treats explanations as latent variables and maximizes the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context without needing to know which explanations are plausible. To ensure the preference for plausible explanations, LiPoR incorporates a regularizer based on the mutual exclusivity of explanations. The method was tested on the AlphaNLI dataset, where it outperformed zero-shot models and previous unsupervised approaches, including a GPT-3 baseline, by over 4 absolute points in accuracy.

    <sample id="166">The presentation introduces a new framework called "A Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Framework for Image Retrieval from Linguistically Complex Text," developed by Yunxin from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen. This framework addresses the challenge of retrieving images from complex textual descriptions, where traditional visual language models struggle due to their reliance on analogical reasoning (System 1). The proposed method leverages the Divide-and-Conquer strategy and Dual-Process Theory, integrating both analogical and logical reasoning (System 1 and System 2) to improve performance.

The framework consists of three main components: the Proposition Generator, the Visual-Linguistic Interactor, and the Neural-Symbolic Reasoner. The Proposition Generator decomposes complex text into simpler propositions, which are then processed by the Visual-Linguistic Interactor to generate matching scores and reasoning states. The Neural-Symbolic Reasoner, acting as System 2, integrates these states to derive the final solution, using negation and conjunction operations.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, NDCR, outperforms existing baselines, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of each module. The framework's ability to present intermediate inference states and results highlights its interoperability. The presentation concludes by suggesting that neural symbolic calculation could enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, with the Divide-and-Conquer approach offering a promising method for tackling complex problems.</sample>

    <sample id="169">David Vilar reviews the paper "Prompting PaLM for Translation: Assessing Strategies and Performance," co-authored with colleagues from Google Translate. The paper explores the use of the PaLM language model, a 540 billion-parameter model trained on 780 billion tokens, for machine translation. It presents the first systematic study of large language model prompting for translation, evaluating PaLM's capabilities using best practices from the machine translation (MT) community. The study compares PaLM's performance to state-of-the-art systems using the latest test sets and metrics, including neural MT metrics and human evaluations.

The research highlights the significant impact of prompting strategies on translation performance. Experiments showed that different prompts could lead to substantial differences in translation quality, measured in BLEURT points. A 5-shot prompting strategy, where sentences are marked with their respective languages, was found effective, with the quality of examples being more crucial than their similarity to the source sentence.

The study found that while PaLM's translations are fluent and comparable to state-of-the-art systems, they often suffer from accuracy issues, particularly omission errors. PaLM tends to produce fluent translations by sometimes omitting parts of the source text. Despite these issues, PaLM's translations are close to those of commercial systems like Google Translate, with lower "Style/Awkward" scores indicating fluent output. The paper provides recommendations for prompt selection strategies to optimize translation performance.</sample>

    <sample id="174">The paper "ArgAnalysis35K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Argument Quality Analysis" introduces a novel dataset designed to address limitations in existing argument quality datasets. ArgAnalysis35K comprises 35,000 argument-analysis pairs, making it the largest dataset in this field. Unlike traditional datasets that often rely on crowdsourcing and cover a limited range of motions, ArgAnalysis35K sources arguments from high-quality debates, expert debaters, and a diverse range of themes. This approach ensures a higher quality and diversity of arguments.

A key innovation is the introduction of "analysis," a concept that combines claims and premises to provide a more comprehensive explanation of arguments. This addition enhances the dataset's utility for natural language processing (NLP) tasks by offering richer context and understanding.

The dataset also incorporates instance-based annotator reliability, allowing for more nuanced use of annotations by considering annotator biases on a per-argument basis. This method improves the reliability of argument quality assessments.

Furthermore, ArgAnalysis35K introduces a relevance model, assigning scores to arguments based on their applicability to various themes. This model acknowledges that arguments can be relevant across multiple contexts, enhancing the dataset's versatility.

Overall, ArgAnalysis35K offers a more diverse, high-quality, and reliable resource for argument quality analysis, with potential applications in NLP and debate analysis.</sample>

    <sample id="179">Melanie Sclar discusses the challenge of improving Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT, which struggle with false-belief tasks. ToM involves understanding others' mental states, often tested through scenarios like the Sally-Anne test. Sclar introduces SymbolicToM, a method that enhances ToM reasoning by using explicit graphical representations of characters' beliefs. These graphs, such as BBob and BBob,Alice, represent different levels of belief about the world state and are computed using natural language inference (NLI) and open information extraction (OpenIE) models.

SymbolicToM allows efficient question answering by mapping questions to these belief graphs, enabling LLMs to answer complex ToM questions more accurately. Experiments show significant performance improvements across various LLMs, with gains like 65 accuracy points for GPT-3-Davinci. The method was tested on the ToMi dataset and two new datasets designed to assess generalization: D₁ for story structure and ParaphrasedToMi for linguistic diversity. While supervised models struggled with these datasets, SymbolicToM demonstrated robust performance, even allowing models like GPT-4 to fully solve the challenges. Overall, SymbolicToM offers a plug-and-play solution that enhances LLMs' ToM reasoning without the risk of overfitting, providing interpretable and improved performance in out-of-domain scenarios.</sample>

    <sample id="181">This paper introduces "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning," addressing the gap in planning for specific goals with constraints, such as "make a chocolate cake," rather than abstract goals like "make a cake." The study defines constrained language planning, where abstract goals are adapted to specific, constraint-laden real-life scenarios. Evaluating large language models' performance in this context revealed unsatisfactory results, particularly in maintaining faithfulness to constraints despite acceptable semantic completeness. The research identifies variability in performance across different constraint categories and proposes an over-generate-then-filter method to enhance script quality. This method involves generating multiple scripts and using a filter model to select those most faithful to constraints, leveraging InstructGPT embeddings and keyword-based rewards. To facilitate training smaller, specialized models, the study employs symbolic knowledge distillation to create the CoScript dataset, comprising 55,000 specific goals with scripts. Quality assurance was ensured through crowd-sourced revisions. The CoScript dataset demonstrates high diversity in constraints and enables smaller models, like T5, to outperform larger models when fine-tuned on this dataset. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of CoScript to advance research in constrained language planning.</sample>

    <sample id="192">Yang Luo presents "CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization," addressing the challenge of designing an optimizer that achieves both fast convergence and low memory usage. Traditional adaptive methods like Adam require significant memory for gradient estimates, while memory-efficient methods like Adafactor reduce memory usage but often at the cost of performance. CAME aims to balance these aspects by leveraging non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to reduce memory requirements and addressing erroneous updates in training deep neural networks.

CAME introduces an efficient approach to minimize the side effects of insecure updates by using the residual between momentum and current updates as a measure of instability. This instability is used to adaptively adjust the optimization step. Experiments on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia demonstrate CAME's effectiveness, showing significant improvements over Adam and Adafactor in training large language models like BERT, GPT-2, and T5. Specifically, CAME increases validation accuracy by about 3.4% compared to Adafactor and outperforms Adam in pre-training large models with reduced memory costs, especially with larger batch sizes.

CAME also shows enhanced performance in training BERT-Large and achieves comparable downstream task performance with less memory usage. Compared to optimizers like Adam and LAMB, CAME significantly reduces memory footprint, making it a promising solution for large batch training in large language models.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The work "Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree for Explainable Question Answering" addresses the challenges in explainable question answering (XQA) by proposing a novel framework called RoHT. XQA aims to provide answers along with explanations, and current methods fall into two categories: neuro-symbolic methods, which use formal representations like SPARQL, and decompose-based methods, which generate intermediate steps in natural language. Both approaches have limitations, such as dependency on structured knowledge bases (KBs) or free-text corpora, which can lead to incomplete answers or difficulties due to language diversity. RoHT tackles these issues by integrating knowledge from heterogeneous sources through a hierarchical question decomposition tree (HQDT). This tree breaks down complex questions into sub-questions and atomic questions, allowing for flexible knowledge source selection. The framework involves two stages: building the HQDT to understand the question's structure and conducting probabilistic reasoning over the tree to fuse knowledge from both KBs and text corpora. The reasoning process involves scheduling appropriate knowledge sources, executing queries, and aggregating answers. RoHT was evaluated on the KQA Pro and Musique datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods by effectively combining knowledge from KBs and text, and outperforming end-to-end models like TransferNet. The results highlight the benefits of explicit decomposition and the integration of diverse knowledge sources in answering complex questions.</sample>

    <sample id="205">Shangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, presented research on political biases in language models, focusing on how these biases propagate from pretraining data to downstream tasks. The study highlights that language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which includes significant coverage of political news media like the New York Times and The Guardian. This results in models learning diverse perspectives but also inheriting social biases, potentially leading to fairness issues in applications.

The research investigates the political bias propagation pipeline by evaluating the political leanings of language models and their impact on downstream tasks. Preliminary results show that models like GPT-4 exhibit liberal biases, while others like the BART series are more conservative. Controlled experiments further demonstrate that pretraining on partisan corpora shifts models' ideological coordinates, with models trained on left-leaning data becoming more liberal.

The study also explores societal polarization by pretraining models on data from before and after the 45th U.S. president, revealing a shift towards more polarized political leanings post-2017. In downstream tasks like hate speech and fake news detection, models with different political biases show varying performance based on the target group, indicating fairness issues. For instance, left-leaning models better detect hate speech against minority groups but struggle with more powerful groups, and vice versa for right-leaning models.

The research underscores the dilemma of addressing political biases in language models, balancing between bias propagation and the risk of censorship.</sample>

    <sample id="215">Adam Przepiórkowski's talk focuses on the dependency structures of coordination, comparing different theoretical approaches. Universal Dependencies and Igor Mel'čuk's Meaning-Text Theory both adopt an asymmetric approach, where the first conjunct is the head of the coordinate structure. The Prague Dependency Treebanks use a conjunction-headed approach, while Hudson's Word Grammar proposes a multi-headed approach, treating all conjuncts as heads. Przepiórkowski argues for symmetric structures of coordination, using the principle of dependency length minimization. This principle suggests that shorter dependencies are preferred, as illustrated by sentence structures where heavy direct objects can be placed after adjuncts without violating grammatical norms. His analysis of the Penn Treebank reveals that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, especially when the governor is on the left or absent. This tendency diminishes when the governor is on the right. These findings support symmetric coordination structures over asymmetric ones, as they better align with the observed linguistic patterns. Przepiórkowski invites further discussion at the poster session.</sample>
    <sample id="217">The work "Seen to Unseen: Exploring Compositional Generalization of Multi-Attribute Controllable Dialogue Generation" by Weihao Zeng, Lulu Zhao, and Keqing He addresses the limitations of previous dialogue generation methods that focus on single attributes. They propose a novel approach, Disentangled Controllable Generation (DCG), to handle multi-attribute dialogue generation. DCG learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses a disentanglement loss to separate different attribute combinations. The model is based on the DialoGPT framework and incorporates two types of prompts: attribute-oriented and task-oriented. Attribute-oriented prompts guide the model to focus on specific information, while task-oriented prompts leverage global features. These prompts are combined to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between attribute combinations. The authors introduce a unified reference-free evaluation framework, MAE, to assess different attribute granularities without needing large-scale labeled data. They establish benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of DCG and MAE through experiments, showing superior performance in attribute controllability and text equality. The model effectively generalizes from seen to unseen attribute combinations, outperforming existing methods. The study highlights the importance of task-oriented prompts in improving evaluation metrics and confirms the generality of MAE across different pre-trained language models. The results validate the model's ability to disentangle attribute combinations and generalize effectively.</sample>

    <sample id="219">Jia-Huei Ju from Academia Sinica presented a study titled "A Compare-and-contrast Multistage Pipeline for Uncovering Financial Signals in Financial Reports," co-authored with Yu-Shiang Huang, Cheng-Wei Lin, and advisors Professors Che Lin and Chuan-Ju Wang. The research focuses on analyzing Form 10-K annual reports required by the SEC, aiming to automate the extraction of useful information that typically requires significant human effort. The study was motivated by the observation that financial reports are highly similar year-over-year, with about 80% of tokens being the same, and the need to identify changes and new information.

The proposed solution involves a highlighting task and a multi-stage pipeline. The task involves comparing a target report with its previous year's report to identify important words that signify changes or new information. The pipeline includes document segmentation, relation recognition, and two fine-tuning stages: out-of-domain and in-domain. The relation recognition stage classifies report pairs into three types: highly similar, revised, and mismatched pairs. The model is fine-tuned using an external dataset (eSNLI) and pseudo-labels from revised pairs, employing soft labeling techniques to address low-quality pseudo-labels.

The evaluation showed that the domain-adaptive highlighting model performed well on both the FINAL dataset and the eSNLI dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability. Future work includes enhancing the model's effectiveness and incorporating additional features from information retrieval techniques.

    <sample id="222">The work "To Adapt or to Annotate: Challenges and Interventions for Domain Adaptation in Open-Domain Question Answering" addresses the challenge of adapting QA models trained on general-purpose domains like Wikipedia to answer questions in specialized domains such as biomedicine. The study explores data interventions to improve model performance across different domains. Two main methods are investigated: zero-shot and few-shot adaptations. Few-shot methods involve using a few examples from the target domain to generate more data, improving retriever and reader performance by 8% and 11%, respectively. Zero-shot techniques focus on controlling interactions among question, answer, and context by varying one while keeping the others fixed, finding that cloze-style questions are easier to curate and that uniform answer distributions work best. The study also examines dataset shifts—concept, covariate, and full shifts—using compatibility measures to map target datasets onto a 2D grid. It concludes that few-shot adaptations are generally effective, while zero-shot methods benefit datasets with concept and covariate shifts. Overall, the research demonstrates that specific data interventions can significantly enhance reader performance, with improvements up to 24%, depending on the type of dataset shift.</sample>

    <sample id="227">The research highlights the challenge of grounded language understanding in current language models, which struggle due to a lack of grounding during pre-training. Grounded language understanding involves mapping natural language expressions to executable plans or programs in specific environments, such as smart assistants, semantic search, and domestic robots. The main issue is that language models, pre-trained on textual data, often generate plans that are not grammatically or logically valid. The proposed solution is a novel framework named Pangu, inspired by Chinese mythology, which separates the generation and validation tasks. In this framework, a symbolic agent generates candidate plans, while a language model scores and ranks them, focusing on discrimination rather than generation. This approach leverages the language model's strength in discrimination, avoiding issues with plan validity. Experiments with models like BERT, T5, and Codex show that Pangu outperforms traditional methods in knowledge-based question answering, demonstrating strong sample efficiency and robustness under non-i.i.d settings. The key takeaway is that for grounded language understanding, discrimination is a more effective strategy than generation.</sample>

    <sample id="229">Gabriella Skitalinskaya and Henning Wachsmuth present their research on improving argumentative writing through detecting and revising suboptimal claims. They emphasize the importance of text revision in achieving optimal phrasing, particularly in argumentative writing, where precise language can significantly impact the audience. The paper introduces two tasks: Suboptimal-Claim Detection, which determines if a claim needs revision, and Claim Improvement Suggestion, which identifies quality issues for revision. The authors explore using implicit revision patterns from online debate platforms like Kialo to model argument quality. They highlight challenges in using revision-based data, including representativity, model complexity, contextual dependencies, and biases. The paper discusses how to compile reliable datasets, select appropriate models, and consider contextual information. It also addresses biases from users and moderators. The research concludes that revision-based data is effective for these tasks, with modeling the distance between claim versions aiding in detecting suboptimal claims. The impact of contextual information varies depending on the task and quality issues. The paper provides a detailed analysis of strategies to address these challenges and compares different approaches.</sample>

    <sample id="233">The paper "Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation" by Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi addresses the challenges of Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST), which involves translating spoken language into text in another language in real time. Current SimulST models face issues such as complex architectures, lengthy training procedures, and the need for multiple models to achieve different latency levels. The proposed solution, EDAtt (Encoder-Decoder Attention), leverages existing offline speech translation models without retraining. It uses a single model for all latency regimes, managing latency through specific parameters and the attention mechanism. The EDAtt strategy decides whether to emit partial translations based on cross-attention weights. A word is emitted if attention is not concentrated on the last few speech frames, indicating stable information. The approach is evaluated using BLEU scores for translation quality and average lagging for latency, with results showing that EDAtt outperforms other strategies, including Wait-k and Local Agreement, and is the fastest when considering computational-aware time. The authors have made their code and models open source to support reproducibility.</sample>

    <sample id="238">Yebowen Hu from the University of Central Florida introduces MeetingBank, a new benchmark dataset for meeting summarization. The dataset addresses challenges in creating high-quality meeting summaries and locating trustworthy public meeting resources. MeetingBank comprises 1,366 City Council meetings with nearly 7,000 instances, including transcripts, reference summaries, and URLs. Data collection involved using the Speechmatics API for transcription and extracting meeting details from City Council websites, such as the Boston City Council. The dataset provides statistics on meeting duration, tokens, speakers, and summarization instances across cities. Analysis of summary abstraction uses coverage and density scores, revealing varying degrees of editing across cities. Model evaluation tested extractive systems (Oracle, LEAD, LexRank, TextRank) and neural abstractive models (BART-Large, Pegasus, Longformer, DialogLM, HMNet), including GPT-3. Extractive systems showed promise, with Oracle achieving high ROUGE-2 scores. DialogLM excelled among abstractive models. GPT-3, despite lower automatic metric performance, scored highest in human evaluations for fluency and coherence but lagged in informativeness and factuality. The findings suggest a need for improved evaluation metrics aligned with human preferences. MeetingBank serves as a valuable resource for developing advanced meeting summarizers and offers insights into City Council decision-making processes.</sample>
    <sample id="241">Ethan discusses the paper "Human-in-the-loop Evaluation for Early Misinformation Detection: A Case Study of COVID-19 Treatments," co-authored with Yang Chen, Wei Xu, and Alan Ritter at Georgia Tech. The paper addresses shortcomings in current misinformation detection systems, which often use retrospectively constructed datasets and lack human-centric approaches. The proposed framework integrates human feedback throughout the misinformation detection process, from raw tweets to actionable outputs. The system comprises two main components: detecting misleading claims and verifying policy violations. The first component uses keyword filtering and a T5 model for claim extraction, ranking claims by trendiness for human verification. The second component employs a BERT-based model to classify the stance of tweets towards unapproved treatments, flagging supportive tweets for human review. The evaluation focuses on early detection, defined as identifying unapproved treatments before they are debunked in news articles. The system achieves a 65% accuracy in policy violation detection and confirms 124.2 policy violations per human hour worked. The framework aims to realistically capture the interaction between automated systems and human moderators, encouraging the development of future human-in-the-loop systems. The work also offers an industry perspective on misinformation detection system development and evaluation.</sample>

    <sample id="245">The presentation by Lining Zhang and co-authors introduces a two-step pipeline for identifying high-agreement Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers for summarization tasks. The motivation is to address the limitations of automatic metrics and unclear best practices for MTurk recruitment. The pipeline begins with "Qualification Settings," where pre-task qualifications like location and HIT Approval Rate are set. The first stage, "Qualification Task," evaluates workers' ability to assess multiple dimensions of summaries, categorizing them into gold, silver, bronze, and block types. Only gold and silver workers advance, resulting in 26 qualified workers (13% of 200 participants). The second stage, "Endurance Task," tests workers' capacity for heavy workloads, with 12 workers (6% of 200) passing. These workers show higher inter-annotator agreement (IAA) than experts, with Krippendorff's Alpha at 0.443. The "Reference-based Task" assesses general performance, with 8 out of 12 workers completing all HITs and achieving a Krippendorff's Alpha of 0.534. Baseline MTurk workers, filtered by MACE, show a Krippendorff's Alpha of 0.380, while CloudResearch workers achieve 0.513 but with lower task acceptance. Analysis reveals significant correlation between Pipeline and CloudResearch workers, though Pipeline does not ensure correctness training. The pipeline effectively filters high-agreement workers, achieving quality comparable to CloudResearch at a lower cost. Future work will explore hiring high-quality workers across various tasks, languages, and platforms. Limitations include testing only English summarization on MTurk and the non-universality of designed questions. The research was funded by Google.</sample>

    <sample id="247">Jiho Kim from KAIST AI presents the paper "FACTKG: Fact Verification via Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs," introducing a new task and dataset for fact verification using knowledge graphs. Existing datasets like FEVER and VitaminC use Wikipedia text, while TabFact and InfoTabs use tables as evidence. FACTKG is the first to utilize knowledge graphs, specifically DBpedia, for fact verification, offering intuitive evidence that directly connects to claims, enabling reliable reasoning. This approach is practical for tasks requiring consistency checks between knowledge graphs and natural language, such as in dialogue systems.

The FACTKG dataset includes claims in both written and colloquial styles, with labels SUPPORTED and REFUTED. It involves retrieving evidence from DBpedia and verifying claims using five types of reasoning: one-hop, conjunction, existence, multi-hop, and negation. One-hop claims involve verifying a single relation between two entities, while conjunction claims require verifying multiple one-hop claims. Existence claims check if an entity is connected to a specific relation, and multi-hop claims involve verifying paths between entities. Negation requires additional inference to confirm the absence of a relationship.

The dataset was created using a colloquial style transfer model and presupposition templates. Baselines were constructed, including Claim Only and GEAR models, with the GEAR model outperforming others by utilizing graph evidence. The dataset is available for download, and Jiho Kim invites further contact for more information.</sample>

    <sample id="252">Sai Kiran Tanikella, a master's student at IIT Kanpur, presented "U-CREAT: Unsupervised Case Retrieval using Events extrAcTion," a collaborative work with Abhinav Joshi, Akshat Sharma, and Ashutosh Modi. The project addresses the challenge of Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) in the legal domain, where legal professionals need to find relevant past cases from a growing pool of documents. U-CREAT introduces two key contributions: the IL-PCR dataset and the U-CREAT pipeline. The IL-PCR dataset, a new benchmark for PCR tasks, comprises 7,070 Indian legal cases with an average of 6.775 citations per document, offering a comprehensive test bed for PCR algorithms. It is compared to the COLIEE’21 dataset, which contains Canadian legal documents, highlighting IL-PCR's larger case pool, longer documents, and richer vocabulary.

The U-CREAT pipeline employs unsupervised learning and an event-based approach to improve PCR efficiency and generalization across legal systems without specific tuning. It uses dependency parsing to extract events from case documents, forming subject-verb-object triplets. These events are then used to compute an interaction matrix between query and candidate documents, aiding in candidate ranking.

Experiments with various models, including count-based, transformer-based, and event-based models, showed that event-based models, particularly the Event Filtered Documents model, significantly outperformed baselines like BM25. U-CREAT demonstrated superior performance on both IL-PCR and COLIEE’21 datasets, establishing it as a state-of-the-art method for PCR tasks. The work opens new avenues for further research in legal document retrieval.</sample>
    <sample id="253">Mario Ezra Aragón presented "DisorBERT: A Double Domain Adaptation Model for Detecting Signs of Mental Disorders in Social Media," a collaborative effort between researchers from Mexico and Spain. The project aims to detect mental health disorders by analyzing social media posts, leveraging domain adaptation to improve model performance when annotated data is insufficient. DisorBERT builds on BERT, a general language model, adapting it to the specific language of Reddit and mental health. The approach involves integrating information from Reddit, mental health, and a lexicon to guide the masking process, focusing on important words during training. The model was tested using the eRisk datasets, showing a balanced precision and recall compared to other methods. DisorBERT was evaluated using sentences from Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), demonstrating its ability to predict words with a psychological orientation, such as "focus" and "sleep," compared to BERT's more general predictions. The model's predictions were weighted by frequency, showing a bias towards mental disorder-related words. Visualization tools highlighted key words and sentences in user posts, such as "anxious" and "medication," relevant to depression. DisorBERT outperformed MentalBERT, a model trained on extensive data, achieving a solid balance in identifying and correctly labeling users with mental disorders. Future work includes exploring different lexical resources and clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="254">Sun Qi from Nanjing University of Science and Technology presents research on "Uncertainty Guided Label Denoising for Document-level Distant Relation Extraction." The study addresses the challenge of extracting relations among entities in documents using distantly supervised data, which often contains noise. Traditional methods using pseudo labels risk introducing false positives, leading to incorrect relations. To mitigate this, the research proposes a framework that incorporates uncertainty estimation to improve label quality. The framework involves training a pre-denoising Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) model with both distantly supervised and human-annotated data to generate pseudo labels. Uncertainty estimation, using Monte Carlo dropout, helps determine the trustworthiness of model predictions, especially for overlapping relations. The study introduces an instance-level uncertainty estimation method to capture uncertainty scores for each relation, addressing the issue of false positives in overlapping relations. Dynamic class uncertainty thresholds are proposed to filter out high-uncertainty pseudo labels, replacing original labels with more reliable ones. A multi-phase training strategy iteratively relabels distantly supervised data to enhance model performance. The framework outperforms existing baselines on public datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in label quality and model performance. Key contributions include the uncertainty-guided label denoising framework, instance-level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations, iterative re-labeling with dynamic thresholds, and overall performance enhancements.</sample>

    <sample id="258">Chiang Cheng-Han introduces a new work titled "Can Large Language Models Be an Alternative to Human Evaluation?" The study explores using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate text quality in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The approach involves instructing LLMs to rate text samples based on given instructions, similar to how human evaluators are used. The motivation behind this research is to find a stable and reproducible alternative to human evaluation, which is often inconsistent and difficult to replicate.

The study compares LLM evaluations with human evaluations, using English teachers as human evaluators due to their expertise in scoring essays. The experiment involves rating stories generated by GPT-2 or written by humans, focusing on attributes like grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance. Four LLMs were tested: T0, InstructGPT (Curie and Davinci), and ChatGPT. Results showed that while some smaller LLMs did not show a clear preference for human-written stories, Davinci and ChatGPT did, aligning with human evaluators' preferences.

The paper addresses questions about the agreement between LLMs and human evaluators, the impact of instruction wording, response sampling methods, and the benefits and costs of using LLMs over human evaluation. The findings suggest that certain LLMs can serve as viable alternatives to human evaluation in specific tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="259">Yusen Zhang from Penn State University presented "XSemPLR: Cross-Lingual Semantic Parsing in Multiple Natural Languages and Meaning Representations." Semantic parsing involves creating semantic representations of user queries, such as SQL and Lambda Calculus. Cross-lingual semantic parsing translates queries from multiple natural languages into various meaning representations. Existing models are limited in scope, often missing languages like Chinese and certain meaning representations like Lambda Calculus. XSemPLR addresses these gaps by providing a comprehensive dataset with 9 datasets, 5 tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 languages across 15 language families. The benchmark evaluates six settings: Translate-Test, Monolingual Model, Monolingual Few-shot, Multilingual Model, Cross-lingual Zero-shot, and Few-shot transfer. Monolingual models are assessed using Encoder-PTR and Encoder-Decoder models, with Encoder-Decoder showing superior performance. Multilingual training improves performance across languages, except for English, which experiences a "Curse of Multilinguality." Cross-lingual transfer shows significant performance gaps, which are reduced with Few-shot settings. Encoder-Decoder models outperform previous work, and pretraining on English enhances Few-shot performance. However, models like Codex and BLOOM are inadequate for cross-lingual tasks. XSemPLR offers a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing, revealing key insights into multilingual language models.</sample>

    <sample id="263">The work "Mitigating Label Biases for In-context Learning" addresses the instability in in-context learning with large language models, caused by biases from design choices like example selection and order. The study identifies three types of label biases: vanilla-label bias (uncontextual label preference), context-label bias (effects from context), and a newly identified domain-label bias (influence of task corpus on predictions). Experiments show that random in-domain words can bias predictions, unlike random English words, highlighting the impact of domain-label bias. The study proposes a novel calibration method, domain-context calibration, to mitigate these biases. This method uses random in-domain words to estimate and adjust model biases, improving prediction accuracy. Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, especially in tasks with high domain-label bias. The method outperforms previous calibration techniques by using multiple random words and considering domain-specific influences. The findings are consistent across various models and datasets, including larger models like GPT-3, showing better decision boundaries post-calibration. This work systematically investigates label biases in in-context learning and offers a robust solution to enhance model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="264">Lin Wang, a graduate student at Zhejiang University, presented a paper titled "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation." The paper addresses the challenges in multimodal text generation tasks, such as audio-visual text generation, which are hindered by the difficulty and expense of data annotation and domain shifts. Wang proposes a novel task, Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation, to overcome these challenges by aligning visual concepts across domains using a unified audio semantic space. The framework consists of three components: an audio-visual meta-mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model generator, and counterfactual contrastive learning. The meta-mapper network maps visual concepts into a unified audio space, using learnable tokens to align visual content with audio semantics. The encoder and generator use a transformer-based model with an alpha parameter to evaluate the contribution of different modalities. The Dual Counterfactual Contrastive Learning (DCLL) method optimizes visual-textual alignment without relying on negative samples. The model is trained using a meta-learning approach, with experiments conducted on MSVD and MSR-VTT benchmarks in cross-datasets and cross-domain settings. The proposed method outperformed existing models, particularly in low-resource domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in transferable audio-visual text generation.</sample>

The study focuses on five Indian languages: Tamil, Malayalam (Dravidian), and Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati (Indo-Aryan). From the Flores dataset, 200 sentences per language were selected, generating 1,400 candidate translations per language using seven translation models/APIs, totaling 7,000 samples. Bilingual expert annotators evaluated these translations using the MQM framework, marking errors by type and severity, and providing overall scores. The study found that recent MT models like NLLB and Indic Trans performed better than older models. Among metrics, chrF showed the highest correlation with human scores, but overlap-based metrics overall performed poorly. Embedding-based metrics like LabSE and BERTscore with multilingual models showed better correlations, with MuRIL performing well on average. COMET-metric variants had the highest correlations across all languages. However, many metrics, including SacreBLEU, exhibited a skewed score range, limiting interpretability. Analysis revealed higher correlations with human scores for accuracy errors compared to fluency errors. Fine-tuning COMET with the MQM dataset resulted in IndicCOMET, which outperformed COMET baselines in most languages and demonstrated robustness in the ACES Translation Accuracy Challenge Sets. The dataset is publicly available for further research.</sample>

Additionally, the Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive Loss (SWFC) is introduced to improve classification of minority and similar emotions by emphasizing hard-to-classify samples. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate MultiEMO's state-of-the-art performance, particularly in challenging scenarios. Limitations include VisExtNet's inability to distinguish between speakers and irrelevant scene people, SWFC's large batch size requirement, and persistent performance gaps in minority emotions.</sample>
    <sample id="281">The presentation "When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-driven, Multilingual Exploration" by Kayo Yin and collaborators explores the necessity of context in translation. The study identifies that only a small portion of translations depend on context, making it challenging to evaluate translation models using standard metrics like BLEU. The research introduces Pointwise Contextual Mutual Information (P-CXMI) to measure context dependency at both sentence and word levels. Analyzing TED talk transcripts translated into 14 languages, the study identifies patterns in context-dependent translations, such as dual pronouns in Arabic and verb forms in various languages. The findings led to the creation of the Multilingual Discourse-Aware (MuDA) tagger, which identifies context-dependent words in translations. The MuDA benchmark evaluates translation models on document-level tasks, revealing that context-aware models outperform context-agnostic ones in handling formality and lexical cohesion, but not in ellipsis, pronouns, and verb forms. The study also compares commercial systems, showing DeepL's superior performance over Google Translate in document-level translation. This research highlights the importance of context in translation and provides a benchmark for assessing document-level translation models.</sample>
    <sample id="282">This presentation introduces "StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Author-Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing," a novel approach to non-parallel text style transfer at the story and discourse levels, presented at ACL 2023. Traditional studies have focused on token or sentence-level style transfer, such as sentiment or formality, but StoryTrans advances this by addressing the more complex task of story-level style transfer, crucial for imitating an author's unique style. The main challenge lies in replicating author-specific linguistic preferences, including discourse structures and narrative techniques, which are often tied to specific topics, complicating style transfer. To address these challenges, StoryTrans employs a generation model that learns discourse representations from source texts and integrates them with learnable style embeddings to produce target-style texts. A novel training objective is introduced to minimize stylistic features in discourse representations, bringing different text representations closer in latent space, while enhancing content preservation through a two-stage generation process. The first stage involves transferring source text with masked style-specific content keywords, followed by a second stage that incorporates these keywords to complete the text. The training framework includes self-reconstruction, disentanglement, sentence order, and style classifier losses. Extensive experiments on new Chinese and English datasets demonstrate StoryTrans's superior performance in style control and content preservation compared to strong baselines, with style visualization confirming alignment with target styles.</sample>

    <sample id="284">Peng Tianshuo from Wuhan University presented a paper titled "FSUIE: A Novel Fuzzy Span Mechanism for Enhancing Universal Information Extraction" at ACL's Main Conference. The paper addresses the limitations of current span-based Universal Information Extraction (UIE) models, which rely heavily on precise span boundaries, often leading to ambiguity due to multiple reasonable annotations. To tackle this, the authors propose a fuzzy span mechanism where span boundaries are learned as continuous distributions rather than precise points. This approach involves adaptive attention that models the span boundary as a probability distribution, with R-min and R-max indicating the fuzzy boundary limits. The correctness of each position is represented by a function Q, and a sampling function converts this distribution into discrete values for fuzzy span loss calculation. The loss combines Binary Cross Entropy with a KL-divergence component to align predicted boundaries with fuzzy spans and supplementary information. A fuzzy span attention mask function dynamically adjusts the attention span and linearly decays attention at the boundaries, enhancing the model's decision-making without affecting text encoding. Experiments on named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction demonstrate FSUIE's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets. The ablation study confirms that both fuzzy span loss and attention improve convergence and information extraction capabilities. Visualizations show the model's focus on relevant semantic information, validating the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy span mechanism.</sample>
    <sample id="285">Mingqi Gao from Peking University presents their work on "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation Framework." The study addresses factual errors in dialogue summarization, proposing two main solutions: incorporating factuality objectives during training or inference, and designing a Factual Error Correction (FEC) model. FEC models, which are independent of summarization models, take a source document and a generated summary to produce a corrected version. The study highlights flaws in current FEC evaluations, which rely on factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE, providing vague overall scores and blurring the distinction between correction and generation. To address these issues, the study advocates for manually annotated reference corrections, offering more precise training data and evaluation. The proposed evaluation framework, based on ERRANT, includes alignment, classification, and comparison steps, and introduces a new taxonomy of factual errors, distinguishing between content-based and form-based errors. Experiments show that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue datasets improves performance, as measured by unreliable factuality metrics. The study suggests that combining human-annotated data with synthetic data is promising, but current FEC models struggle with certain error types, such as additions and attribute errors.</sample>

The project challenges the traditional notion of a single "ground truth" in data annotation by developing a more nuanced approach to irony detection. They created the English Perspectivist Irony Corpus (EPIC), collecting 300 short conversations from social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter over 1.5 years, covering five English varieties. Using Prolific, 74 annotators from diverse backgrounds labeled these conversations for irony. The study revealed significant inter-annotator agreement variations based on demographics such as gender, age, and nationality. Perspective-aware models, trained on these diverse annotations, showed increased confidence compared to standard models. Notably, generational and geographical differences influenced irony perception, with the most significant variations observed between annotators from the UK and Ireland. This research highlights the complexity of irony in NLP and the value of considering diverse perspectives in model training.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The project "From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns: Unveiling Coded Rhetoric with Language Models" explores the use of dogwhistles—terms that convey different messages to in-groups and out-groups—in political rhetoric. An example is the term "cosmopolitan," which some interpret as a coded reference to Jewish people. Understanding dogwhistles is crucial for natural language processing (NLP) and linguistics because they challenge traditional notions of meaning and are context-dependent. The project develops a typology and glossary of over 340 dogwhistles, focusing on racist, transphobic, and anti-Semitic terms, primarily in U.S. English. The study includes a case analysis of historical U.S. political speeches, revealing a correlation between the use of racial dogwhistles and the Republican Southern Strategy post-Civil Rights era. The research evaluates GPT-3's ability to identify and surface dogwhistles, noting variability in performance, especially with informal and transphobic terms. The study also examines how dogwhistles can evade content moderation by testing toxicity detection with the Prospective API, showing that sentences with dogwhistles are often rated less toxic than those with explicit slurs. This project highlights the importance of understanding dogwhistles for both political analysis and improving automated content moderation systems.</sample>
    <sample id="298">The findings that led to the conclusion that temporal drift is the main cause of performance loss include:

1. The observation that there was no adaptive overfitting, as indicated by the red best fit line having a gradient greater than one, showing no diminishing returns on the CoNLL++ dataset.
2. The experiment where models were retrained or continued to be pre-trained with more recent data, which showed that performance degraded with a larger temporal gap between the training and test data. This confirmed the hypothesis that temporal drift is the main cause of performance drop.</sample>
    <sample id="299">Michalis Korakakis and Andreas Vlachos from the University of Cambridge present a method to improve the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models by reducing their reliance on shortcuts. NLI models often learn spurious correlations, or shortcuts, from datasets, leading to poor performance on out-of-distribution examples. Traditional shortcut mitigation methods use auxiliary models to identify and down-weight these shortcuts, but these methods have limitations, such as requiring domain-specific knowledge and assuming the learner will exploit the same shortcuts as the auxiliary.

The proposed minimax training method addresses these issues by focusing on under-represented "hard" examples that contradict the shortcuts in "easy" examples. The learner model minimizes the NLI task loss, while the auxiliary model maximizes the learner's loss by generating example weights that encourage the learner to focus on challenging examples. This approach does not assume specific shortcut types and uses a feed-forward network for the auxiliary model. The method is evaluated on datasets like MNLI, FEVER, and QQP, showing improved out-of-distribution performance compared to existing methods. The paper also explores the effects of pre-training the learner, the size of the auxiliary, and conducts a qualitative evaluation of the example weight distribution.</sample>
    <sample id="300">Belinda presents a task called interactive dictation, developed at Semantic Machines with collaborators Jason Eisner, Adam Pauls, and Sam Thomson. Interactive dictation allows users to dictate and edit documents using natural voice commands, without needing to memorize fixed commands. This task involves flexible dictation and editing, using intuitive language for commands. The process includes four steps: speech-to-text conversion, segmentation of dictation and commands, command extraction and normalization, and execution of utterances to produce the final document. Unlike existing systems like Nuance Dragon NaturallySpeaking and Microsoft Word Dictate, which require specific commands, interactive dictation aims for a more natural interface akin to human interaction. To support this new task, a data collection interface was designed, and a dataset was built. A baseline system was created, using models like T5 and GPT-3 to perform the task's steps. The segmentation model showed good accuracy and efficiency, while GPT-3 models were more accurate but slower. Direct state prediction was more effective than intermediate program prediction for GPT-3, while T5 showed minimal accuracy impact with improved efficiency when predicting programs. The work opens avenues for further research, with code and detailed findings available in the accompanying paper.</sample>
    <sample id="302">It is necessary to permute the tokens for the output sequence because, after tagging each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output, the tokens are not in the correct order. The second step of the model predicts a permutation to arrange these tokens into the correct sequence.</sample>
    <sample id="303">The authors recommend that model owners should increase transparency about bias mitigation methods to better understand the origins of positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, and to determine whether these patterns result from excessive value alignment or other anti-stereotyping methods. Without transparency, assumptions cannot be made or further studied.</sample>
    <sample id="304">Minimal-pair unacceptable inputs are sentences that are grammatically incorrect or unacceptable, used in the minimal pair paradigm to evaluate language models. In this paradigm, a model is shown both an acceptable (grammatical) sentence and an unacceptable (ungrammatical) sentence, and the expectation is that the model assigns a higher probability to the acceptable sentence. The study revisits this approach by testing models with longer sequences and different contexts to see how they handle acceptability judgments.</sample>
    <sample id="305">Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University, presents research on weakly supervised learning (WSL), highlighting the reliance on weak labeling sources like heuristic rules and crowdsourcing, which are cheaper but noisy. The research questions whether clean validation data is necessary for WSL, how many clean samples are needed, and how best to use them. Findings show that recent WSL methods require clean validation samples to function properly, with performance dropping significantly without them. Increasing clean samples improves performance, and direct fine-tuning on clean data often outperforms WSL methods. The study suggests that the performance gains of WSL are overestimated and recommends reporting model selection criteria, comparing WSL with few-shot learning, and considering continuous fine-tuning as a baseline. The code for the research is open-sourced for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim present their research on entity tracking in language models, focusing on how these models understand and track changes in entities within a discourse. They highlight the importance of this ability for comprehending longer texts, such as recipes, where entities like ingredients change states as actions are performed. The research aims to evaluate the extent to which large language models can track these changes, addressing challenges like reliance on pre-training data patterns and heuristic associations.

To assess entity tracking, they designed a task involving boxes and objects, where models predict box contents after state-changing operations. The task prevents models from using simple heuristics by requiring them to integrate initial descriptions with operations. Experiments with Flan-T5 and GPT-3/3.5 models using 2-shot in-context learning showed that most models failed to track entities beyond copying initial states, except for text-davinci-003, which demonstrated non-trivial tracking.

Further analysis revealed that GPT-3.5 models trained on substantial code data exhibited better tracking, suggesting code pre-training enhances this ability. Smaller models like T5-base could learn tracking through fine-tuning, but randomly initialized models could not, underscoring the importance of pre-training. The findings suggest that while some models show entity tracking, it's unclear if these abilities generalize beyond the specific setup. More results, including GPT-4 experiments, are available in their paper.</sample>
    <sample id="307">The authors did not specify the exact evaluation metrics used in the presentation. However, they mentioned evaluating models on tasks such as named entity recognition, classification, part-of-speech tagging, and question answering, which typically involve metrics like F1 score, accuracy, precision, recall, and sometimes specific task-related metrics.</sample>
    <sample id="308">Jenny, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, presented research on NLPositionality, which examines design biases in datasets and models, particularly in NLP. The study, conducted with collaborators from the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, highlights how biases can arise from the positionality of researchers and developers, affecting technology performance across different populations. Positionality refers to the perspectives shaped by demographics, identity, and experiences, influencing research outcomes. The research questions whether datasets and models reflect these positionalities, given they aggregate human judgments. Previous work suggested anecdotal evidence of cultural gaps and theoretical definitions of model positionality, but lacked direct comparisons between end users and datasets/models.

NLPositionality addresses this by re-annotating datasets with diverse annotators, comparing these annotations to existing models and datasets using Pearson's R correlation scores. This approach differs from traditional annotator disagreement literature by focusing on end-user alignment. The study utilized Lab in the Wild, an online platform, to gather over 16,000 annotations from 1,000 annotators across 87 countries. Findings indicate that NLP datasets and models are most aligned with English-speaking countries and individuals with higher education. However, non-binary individuals are less represented. Recommendations include documenting design choices, adopting perspectivism in NLP research, and creating specialized datasets for specific communities, exemplified by the Masakhani initiative. The presentation concludes with an invitation to explore further through their dashboard and paper.</sample>

It addresses the lack of large-scale publicly-available multi-modal instruction tasks, unlike the over 1600 language-only instruction tasks available. MultiInstruct is derived from 21 existing open-source datasets, with each task equipped with five expert-written instructions, and is designed to improve generalization to unseen multi-modal tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="317">Peng Li from Fudan University presents "CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information Extractors," addressing challenges in information extraction (IE) tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). Traditional models, such as T5 and GPT-3, struggle with output structure alignment during inference, requiring extensive structured data and special decoding strategies. CodeIE proposes transforming IE into a structure-to-structure code generation task using code language models like Codex. This approach aligns input and output structures, simplifying text-to-structured format conversion. For NER, CodeIE uses a function-based prompt to extract entities, appending text-entity pairs to a list. Similar prompts are designed for RE. The method was evaluated on three NER and four RE datasets, comparing T5, UIE, GPT-3, and Codex models. CodeIE's code-style prompts significantly outperformed traditional text-style prompts in one to few-shot settings. Analysis showed lower perplexity for code format inputs with models like CodeT5, fewer structural errors with Codex, and better alignment with IE tasks. Codex also avoided outputting undefined labels, unlike GPT-3. Overall, Codex outperformed GPT-3, particularly in recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of code format prompts in IE tasks. The study suggests that leveraging code language models can enhance few-shot IE performance.</sample>

    <sample id="320">The factor of overfitting due to test reuse, specifically adaptive overfitting, was not observed in the study. The red best fit line on the graph had a gradient greater than one, indicating that improvements on CoNLL-2003 translated to more than one unit of improvement on CoNLL++, showing no diminishing returns. Therefore, adaptive overfitting was not a significant factor in the performance drop.</sample>
    <sample id="321">The quality of the simplification was evaluated by analyzing the sentence pairs for types of simplification, such as lexical simplification, structure simplification, and overall level of simplification. Additionally, the DEPLAIN corpus was used to evaluate automatic alignment methods, with manually aligned sentences serving as a gold standard. The effectiveness of fine-tuned language models for automatic text simplification was also assessed, with results compared to baseline scores to establish a benchmark for future work.</sample>
    <sample id="322">Enrico will present at ACL 23 on the topic "What does a Text Classifier Learn about Morality?" He explains that human morality, which helps distinguish right from wrong, is subjective and varies among individuals. Traditional approaches in NLP treat morality on a singular scale, but this oversimplifies the complexity of moral judgments, as seen in divisive issues like abortion or LGBTQ rights. Enrico introduces the Moral Foundation Theory, which posits five different moral foundations that people prioritize differently, influencing their moral judgments.

The paper aims to explore how language models understand morality in text using explainable AI techniques. It focuses on the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus, a dataset of 35,000 tweets across seven domains, such as #AllLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter. The study investigates whether language models can discern the nuanced differences in moral expression across these domains.

A key finding is that language models can recognize different moral expressions, such as the contrasting views on subversion in ALM and BLM. ALM associates subversion with negative terms like "overthrow" and "mayhem," while BLM views it more positively. This highlights the importance of domain-specific models to avoid misunderstandings of morality. Enrico emphasizes the need for careful consideration in applying language models to moral contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The paper "Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense QA" by Yujie Wang addresses the challenge of Commonsense QA, which requires machines to answer questions based on common knowledge. The paper highlights issues with existing methods that combine language models and knowledge bases, such as the introduction of noisy entities and limited interaction between text and subgraph modalities. To address these issues, the authors propose DHLK, a method that optimizes knowledge graph (HKG) structure and representation through a two-stage pruning strategy and Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL). The HKG is built using multiple knowledge bases, with paraphrases from WordNet and Wiktionary enhancing the graph. The method employs RoBERTa and Mask Self-Attention to encode and fuse QA contexts and entities, dynamically removing irrelevant entities based on attention weights. TransE is used to optimize entity and relationship embeddings, while Relation Mask Self-Attention (RMSA) models the subgraphs, incorporating relationships into Mask Self-Attention. The HKG graph embedding is obtained through max-pooling, and path information is integrated into the QA context for enhanced embedding representation. The final answer prediction uses an MLP to determine answer probability. Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA demonstrate that DHLK outperforms other methods by effectively combining language models and HKG, leveraging external knowledge bases like ConceptNet, WordNet, and Wiktionary.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Yes, language models have different political biases. Research shows that language models can exhibit varying political leanings, occupying different quadrants on the political spectrum. For instance, GPT-4 is noted to be more liberal compared to other models like the BART series. These biases can be influenced by the pretraining data, which often includes politically diverse news sources. Controlled experiments further demonstrate that pretraining on partisan corpora can shift a model's ideological stance. Additionally, these biases can affect performance on downstream tasks, such as hate speech and fake news detection, where models may perform differently based on the political leaning of the content they are evaluating. This indicates a pressing fairness issue in NLP applications.</sample>
    <sample id="326">Cognitive dissonance is the state of having two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent with each other, such as believing that cigarettes are harmful but continuing to smoke.

    <sample id="327">Xiao Xu, a PhD student from Harbin Institute of Technology, presented "ManagerTower: Aggregating the Insights of Uni-Modal Experts for Vision-Language Representation Learning" at ACL 2023. The work, developed during an internship at the MSRIC group and supported by Intel Cognitive Computing Group, aims to enhance vision-language (VL) learning, particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). Traditional two-tower architectures, which include textual, visual, and cross-modal encoders, often underutilize the semantic knowledge from different layers of unimodal encoders. BridgeTower attempted to address this by connecting multiple unimodal layers with cross-modal layers, but it faced limitations in effectively utilizing these layers and scalability.

ManagerTower builds on BridgeTower by introducing managers in each cross-modal layer to adaptively aggregate insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at various levels. This approach allows for more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion. Using RoBERTa and CLIP-ViT base as unimodal encoders, ManagerTower demonstrated superior performance on downstream tasks with only four million images for pre-training, achieving a 39.15% accuracy on the Wikivideo test standard. The architecture's adaptive managers showed distinct aggregation weight distributions, highlighting their ability to exploit different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge effectively. ManagerTower outperformed other models, even those trained with more data or parameters, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness. The paper, code, and models are available on Archive and GitHub.</sample>

    <sample id="329">This work, presented by Minghang Zheng from Peking University, introduces a novel approach to zero-shot video sentence localization, a task that identifies video segments most relevant to a given natural language query without manual annotations. Traditional methods generate pseudo-events and pseudo-queries, but they often produce overly simplistic queries and fail to ensure irrelevance outside the events, leading to misalignment and label noise. The proposed method, noise-resistant Structured Pseudo-Label (SPL) generation, addresses these issues by using a pre-trained image caption model to create complex pseudo-queries and a pre-trained model to assess frame-query relevance, ensuring high relevance within events and low relevance outside. The method involves dense video frame sampling, pseudo-query generation using the BLIP model, and pseudo-event generation based on event temporal structure. The quality of events is determined by the difference in similarity within and outside the event, selecting the highest quality events. To mitigate label noise, the approach employs sample re-weighting based on model confidence and IoU, and label refinement by using high-confidence predictions as new pseudo-labels. Experiments on ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets demonstrate that the SPL method outperforms existing zero-shot methods across various metrics, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. The code is available for further exploration.</sample>

    <sample id="333">The presentation introduces "INK: Injecting kNN Knowledge in Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation," a novel framework developed by Wenhao and collaborators from Nanjing University, Shanghai AI Lab, and the University of Hong Kong. The work addresses the limitations of neural machine translation (NMT) models, which often have non-smooth representation spaces leading to poor generalization, especially for low-frequency tokens. The proposed kNN-MT solution smooths predictions using nearest neighbors in the representation space but faces challenges like time-consuming neighbor retrieval and static datastores.

To overcome these issues, the INK framework injects kNN knowledge into the NMT model through a training loop. This loop involves extracting kNN knowledge to adjust representations and asynchronously updating the datastore. The framework aligns contextualized representations with token embeddings and kNN token embeddings to enhance semantic meaning and address sparsity. The INK system outperforms the state-of-the-art kNN-MT system, achieving higher BLEU scores with less memory and faster inference.

Experiments on the WMT’19 German-English news translation task demonstrate significant improvements in representation space and translation performance. The INK system shows that using kNN knowledge and a small adapter can smooth the representation space effectively, even without the datastore during inference. The results indicate that further improvements could be achieved with more effective frameworks, highlighting the potential of smoother representation spaces in NMT models.</sample>

    <sample id="336">Cross-lingual transfer is the process of training a model on one source language and then applying it to another target language without additional training on the target language data. This can be done in two settings: Zero-shot transfer, where the model is directly applied to the target language without any target language data, and Few-shot transfer, where the model is fine-tuned on a small amount of target language data.</sample>
    <sample id="337">The presentation introduces a novel approach for handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in embedding-based models through "Graph-based Relation Mining for Context-free Out-of-vocabulary Word Embedding Learning." The research addresses the challenge of representing OOV words, which are crucial for the performance of downstream models. The proposed method leverages word formation and association, inspired by human learning habits, to infer the meanings of OOV words. A Word Relationship Graph is introduced, which mimics lexical rules and tokenizes OOV words into wordpieces, associating them with relevant words to form a two-level graph. Each word or wordpiece acts as a node, with embeddings serving as node attributes. The first layer retains complete wordpiece information, while the second layer samples nodes to reduce noise. A self-attention network assigns attributes to OOV nodes based on their characters. Two levels of Graph Attention Networks are applied to extract important information and reduce noise, with a readout block layer summarizing the graph information. A simple one-layer Graph Convolutional Network captures word formation, and contrastive learning is used in the loss function to mimic the vector space of background embeddings. The model outperforms baselines in intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, benefiting both static and contextual models. The model's applicability to other languages depends on the rationality of word decomposition, with agglutinative languages being well-suited.</sample>
    <sample id="338">Bingsheng presents the research "Are Human Explanations Always Helpful? Towards Objective Evaluation of Human Natural Language Explanations," a collaborative effort by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research. The study addresses the challenge of evaluating the quality of human-annotated explanations, which are subjective and task-dependent. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE focus on word similarity, while the simulatability score measures performance changes with or without explanations but overlooks task differences and explanation utility during fine-tuning and inference.

The research introduces a unified data format converting various tasks into a multiple-choice format, facilitating seamless application across tasks. Experiments on five datasets (CoS-E, ECQA, e-SNLI, ComVE) reveal that fine-tuning with explanations can significantly improve model performance, highlighting the task-dependent nature of explanations. The study proposes a new metric, TREU, which extends the simulatability score by evaluating explanation helpfulness during fine-tuning. TREU outperforms the simulatability score in reflecting the utility of human explanations, consistently ranking dataset qualities across models T5 and BART.

The findings suggest that human explanations can benefit model predictions even if previously deemed low quality. The research emphasizes the importance of high-quality human collaboration in annotation and recommends future quality checks. Detailed findings are available in the paper.</sample>

    <sample id="340">Kuan-Hao Huang from UCLA presented "ParaAMR: A Large-Scale Syntactically Diverse Paraphrase Dataset by AMR Back-Translation," a collaborative work with Varun, I-Hung, Anoop, Kai-Wei, and Aram. The study addresses the need for large-scale, high-quality paraphrase data in NLP, which is crucial for applications like question answering, chatbots, and enhancing robustness. Existing datasets, such as MRPC, PAN, and Quora, are high-quality but limited in scale, while automatically generated datasets like back-translation lack syntactic diversity.

The proposed solution, ParaAMR, leverages Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR) to create syntactically diverse paraphrases. AMR graphs capture a sentence's abstract meaning, with nodes representing semantic concepts and edges denoting semantic relations. The process involves using a pre-trained AMR parser to generate an AMR graph from a source sentence, altering the graph's focus by randomly selecting a new root node, and then using an AMR graph-to-text generator to produce paraphrases. This method ensures semantic similarity while introducing syntactic diversity.

ParaAMR contains approximately 15 million source sentences, each with around 6.9 paraphrases, demonstrating greater syntactic diversity compared to other back-translation datasets. Quantitative analyses show that ParaAMR maintains semantic similarity while achieving higher syntactic diversity scores. The dataset enhances NLP applications, such as learning sentence embeddings, syntactic control in paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few-shot learning. ParaAMR is available for further research and application.</sample>

The paper addresses the need for a large-scale video-sourced dialogue dataset to enhance open-domain dialogue systems, which currently rely heavily on text-sourced data. Existing video-sourced datasets are limited in scale due to manual annotations and scripted conditions. The paper highlights the importance of personalized dialogue for applications like virtual streamers and employees, noting challenges such as persona representation and session dialogue. LiveChat, the proposed dataset, is constructed from Chinese TikTok and Douyin videos, using automatic methods to extract dialogues and persona information. The dataset is compared with existing datasets, showing its larger scale and richer personal annotations. Experiments on response modeling and addressee recognition demonstrate the benefits of persona profiles and longer sessions. The paper also explores the performance of pre-trained models like BART, finding it superior in handling the unique domain of LiveChat. Future work will focus on efficient transfer learning for large language models (LLMs) using LiveChat.</sample>
    <sample id="344">The drawbacks of tree-based methods include the need to obtain trees, which is often a complicated and computationally expensive process. This typically involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms, such as handling variable symbols, and may require specialized grammar-induction procedures.</sample>
    <sample id="345">This paper introduces a novel approach to compositional generalization in semantic parsing without relying on tree structures. The authors, Matthias Lindemann, Alexander Koller, and Ivan Titov, propose a neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model that directly models correspondences between input and output fragments. The model operates in two steps: first, it tags each input token with an unordered multiset of output tokens, and second, it predicts a permutation to order these tokens correctly. This method avoids the computational complexity and formalism-specific preprocessing required for tree-based models. The permutation model is flexible, allowing for a wide range of possible permutations without hard constraints, and is conceptually similar to solving a "Traveling Salesman" problem, which is approximated using a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation for efficient training. The approach demonstrates strong generalization to deeper recursion on the COGS benchmark, outperforming other treeless models. However, some structural generalization challenges remain. The paper addresses technical challenges such as latent alignments and multiple consistent permutations by inducing alignment during training and learning linguistically plausible permutations. The results highlight the potential of multiset tagging and latent permutations in achieving compositional generalization without trees.</sample>

    <sample id="348">The paper "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models" by Myra, Esin Durmus, and Dan Jurafsky addresses the limitations of current methods for measuring social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches rely on hand-constructed datasets that are time-consuming and often fail to capture intersectional biases. The authors propose a novel method using natural language prompts to generate personas, allowing for the examination of stereotypes across various demographics. By prompting models to describe personas based on specific identity markers, they reveal subtle patterns of bias, such as the depiction of women of color with references to ancestry, unlike their white counterparts.

The method comprises two parts: generating personas and identifying marked words using the sociolinguistic concept of "markedness." This approach highlights specific stereotypes without relying on predefined lexicons. The analysis shows that generated personas contain more stereotypical language than human-written ones, with marked words like "culture" and "exotic" reinforcing harmful narratives. These portrayals often essentialize groups, perpetuating stereotypes like the "Strong Black Women" archetype, which can have negative health impacts.

The authors recommend addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, adopting an intersectional lens in bias research, and increasing transparency in bias mitigation methods. This approach aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of biases in LLMs and guide more effective mitigation strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The presentation by Simone Tedeschi discusses the concept of "superhuman performance" in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and critiques the current evaluation methods in NLP. The paper highlights that leaderboard-based evaluations have become the standard, with systems often achieving human-level or superhuman performance on benchmarks like SuperGLUE and SQuAD. However, the paper questions the validity of these claims, noting that models often outperform humans on tasks involving knowledge, reasoning, and inference, but are brittle and lack generalization.

The paper identifies several issues with current benchmarks, such as systems and humans being evaluated on different sets, with humans often assessed on much smaller subsets. Errors in ground-truth answers and the use of spurious correlations by systems further complicate fair comparisons. The paper also criticizes the vague estimation of human performance, suggesting that comparisons should be made with the best possible human performance rather than simple averages.

Additionally, the paper points out inconsistencies in pay rates for human annotators and the lack of detailed information about the annotator pool, which can affect the quality of human performance data. These issues undermine claims of superhuman performance. The paper concludes by recommending more reliable benchmark construction to avoid these pitfalls.</sample>
    <sample id="351">This paper investigates the generalization capabilities of CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers in 2023. The study addresses whether these models, developed nearly two decades ago, can effectively generalize to modern data. To explore this, the authors created the CoNLL++ Dataset, comprising Reuters News articles from 2020 annotated with CoNLL-2003 guidelines. They fine-tuned over 20 models on CoNLL-2003 and evaluated them on both the original test sets and CoNLL++. The percentage change in F1 scores was used to assess generalization.

The research identifies three key factors for good generalization: model architecture, model size, and the number of fine-tuning examples. Transformer models, larger models, and more fine-tuning examples were found to enhance generalization. The study also examined potential causes for performance drops, focusing on adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. Results indicated that adaptive overfitting was not a significant issue, as improvements on CoNLL-2003 translated to greater improvements on CoNLL++. However, temporal drift was confirmed as the primary cause of performance degradation, with larger temporal gaps between training and test data leading to poorer performance.

In conclusion, the paper affirms that CoNLL-2003 taggers still perform well in 2023, provided they incorporate better architectures, larger sizes, and more fine-tuning examples. The findings highlight the need for further research on improving model generalization and emphasize that temporal drift, rather than adaptive overfitting, is the main challenge.</sample>

The authors propose an interactive approach to improve code generation by generating clarification questions (CQs) to gather missing specifications. They identify key operations in code and use a method to determine if these operations are missing from the NLD by comparing schema elements in latent space. The paper introduces CodeClarQA, a synthetic dataset with clarifications on key operations, and proposes a pipeline involving a Clarification Need Predictor, a Question Selector, and a Code Generator. The authors demonstrate that their method effectively identifies missing key operations, with MPNet showing the best performance. Error analysis reveals challenges such as distinguishing similar operations and the need for argument clarification. The pipeline's performance improves with higher-ranked CQs, though it still underperforms compared to model-only trainers. The study concludes that clarified key operations lead to better code generation, supported by examples where training with Oracle CQAs yields predictions close to the ground truth. The authors invite feedback on their approach and contributions.</sample>

    <sample id="361">Armineh Nourbakhsh, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and research director at JP Morgan AI Research, presents "CounterComp," a method to enhance compositional generalization in multi-step quantitative reasoning for question answering tasks. The focus is on improving neural models' performance on tasks involving financial tables, where questions require multiple arithmetic operations. Current models struggle with these tasks due to memorizing spurious patterns, such as associating specific tokens with operations. CounterComp addresses this by mining counterfactual scenarios from training data, creating positive and negative examples based on whether changes in questions affect outputs. These examples are used to introduce an auxiliary metric learning loss with a dynamic margin, which adjusts based on the extent of question changes. This approach consistently improves model performance, particularly for tasks with more than two reasoning steps, both on in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. The method also helps models focus on meaningful tokens related to operational terms in outputs. The presentation highlights the effectiveness of CounterComp in achieving compositional generalization, with references and further details available in the accompanying poster. Nourbakhsh acknowledges her co-authors, advisors, and audience.</sample>
