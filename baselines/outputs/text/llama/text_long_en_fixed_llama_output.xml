    <sample id="2">The paper "LayoutMask: A Novel Pre-trained Model for Visually-rich Document Understanding" proposes a novel pre-trained model, LayoutMask, to address reading order issues in existing document pre-training models. Unlike previous studies that use ascending numbers to represent the global reading order of tokens in a document, LayoutMask uses in-segment token orders as 1D position, referred to as "local 1D position." This allows the model to infer global reading order by jointly using 1D position, 2D position, and semantic information, promoting in-depth text-layout interactions. To further enhance these interactions, the authors equip the Masked Language Modeling task with two novel masking strategies: Whole Word Masking and Layout-Aware Masking. Additionally, a new pre-training objective, Masked Position Modeling, is designed to recover randomly masked 2D positions during pre-training. The joint learning process with both semantic and spatial inference promotes text-layout interactions and helps the model learn better layout representations. Experimental results show that using local 1D position outperforms global 1D position on both FUNSD and SROIE datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of LayoutMask in addressing reading order issues.</sample>

    <sample id="6">Jiaan presents a joint work, "Towards Unifying Multi-Lingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization," which aims to unify multilingual and cross-lingual summarization into a more general setting called many-to-many summarization. This approach enables a single summarization model to process documents in any source language and generate summaries in any target language. The researchers conducted preliminary studies to analyze the differences between multilingual summarization, cross-lingual summarization, and many-to-many summarization. They found that many-to-many summarization facilitates better task knowledge transfer across languages. To achieve this, the team proposed PISCES, a pre-trained many-to-many summarization model that learns language modeling, cross-lingual ability, and summarization ability through a three-stage pre-training process. Experimental results on the WikiLingua dataset showed that the proposed model outperformed various baselines, including mBART-50 and mT5. Ablation studies and human evaluations further validated the effectiveness of PISCES. This work contributes to the development of more efficient and effective summarization models that can handle multiple languages. The proposed many-to-many summarization setting and the pre-trained model PISCES have the potential to improve language understanding and summarization tasks in real-world applications.</sample>

    <sample id="11">Researchers from AI2 and several other institutions presented a study on the humor understanding capabilities of large language models. They created a dataset using The New Yorker Caption Contest, where readers submit captions for cartoon images, and operationalized it into three tasks: matching, quality ranking, and explanation generation. The study aimed to evaluate the performance of language models on these tasks and compare it to human performance. The results showed that even the best-performing model, CLIP fine-tuned on the corpus, achieved only 62% accuracy on the matching task, compared to 94% for humans. When conditioned to do the same tasks with a human-authored description of the image, language models like GPT-4 still showed a significant performance gap. In the explanation generation task, human explanations were preferred to five-shot GPT-4 explanations in over two-thirds of cases. The study suggests that while large language models can generate jokes and explanations, they do not truly understand humor. The dataset and models are available for further research and experimentation, with a leaderboard to track progress. The findings have implications for the development of more advanced language models that can better understand and generate humor.</sample>

    <sample id="13">This presentation discusses the analysis and improvement of adaptive inference in low-resource settings, specifically focusing on the methods of Multi Model and Early Exit. The authors, Daniel Rotem and colleagues, highlight the pros and cons of each method, noting that Multi Model is more versatile but suffers from high storage costs and overhead, while Early Exit is memory-efficient but prone to conflicting gradients, which can degrade performance. To test their hypothesis, they compared individual Early Exit models to separate Multi Model classifiers, finding that the latter outperformed the former by an average of 2.3%. To address the conflicting gradient issue, the authors propose the SWEET method, which separates weights in Early Exit transformers, allowing each layer to receive updates only from the following classifier. The results show that SWEET closes the gap between Early Exit and Multi Model, outperforming both methods in fast speeds and the entire speed/accuracy curve for BERT-Large. The study's findings motivate future research into fine-tuning algorithms tailored to the Early Exit architecture, and the paper is available on Archive under the title "Finding the SWEET spot".</sample>

    <sample id="17">This PhD research proposes a novel method for multimodal relation extraction, addressing two primary issues: internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation. The existing multimodal relation extraction methods often rely solely on text data, which may lack sufficient context for ambiguous or multi-context words. The proposed method, named GENE-LAMO, incorporates visual sources to enhance the understanding of semantic relations between entities. A Graph Information Bottleneck principle-guided feature refinement is introduced to prune unnecessary information from both text and visual modalities. Additionally, multimodal topic information is leveraged to enrich the overall context. The framework consists of five components: visual scene graph representation, textual scene graph representation, merging the two into a unified backbone cross-modal graph (CMG), fine-grained filtering and adjustment of CMG, and enrichment of CMG features with multimodal topic features. Experimental results on a widely used MRE dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of GENE-LAMO, outperforming text-based methods and multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of internal-information screening and external-information exploiting, which are found to be beneficial in different circumstances, depending on the text-vision relevance of the input.</sample>

    <sample id="19">This presentation discusses the challenges of open-domain question answering systems, particularly in terms of memory costs, inference speed, and performance. The two-stage model proposed by Danqi Chen in 2017, which involves retrieval and reader stages, is a mainstream framework but faces limitations due to the large size of the Wikipedia corpus and the index file. The presentation highlights the need for efficient open-domain question answering systems that can achieve smaller memory costs, faster inference, and comparable performance.

To address these challenges, the authors propose several efficient tactics, including approximate nearest neighbor search for fast evidence research, skip reading for fast reading, and techniques for reducing index size and model size. They also compare existing open-domain question answering models from the data aspect, highlighting the trade-offs between speed, memory, and performance.

Based on this analysis, the authors provide conclusions and insights on how to design efficient open-domain question answering systems, including reducing index size, model size, and pursuing real-time feedback. Finally, they discuss two future works: deploying open-domain question answering systems on low-power devices and considering more evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Researchers investigated the ability of text-to-image models to render visual text, focusing on the Imagen model and its text encoder, T5. They discovered that T5 models struggle with spelling, particularly for less frequent words, due to the subword tokenization method used. In contrast, PaLM models, which use a different tokenization method, achieve near-perfect spelling accuracy but are impractical due to their large size. ByT5, a model that receives individual bytes of the input string, demonstrated excellent spelling abilities. The researchers found that the frequency of the word being spelled affects T5's performance, with more frequent words being represented by a single vocabulary item, making it harder to decompose into individual letters. To improve text rendering models, they augmented the Imagen model with a ByT5 small model, which significantly improved spelling accuracy and image generation characteristics. The study introduced two new benchmarks, WikiSpell and DrawText, to evaluate text-only and text-to-image models, respectively. The findings suggest that concatenating a character-aware model, like ByT5, to the existing text encoder can efficiently improve model spelling ability, paving the way for better text rendering models.</sample>

They compared the length of the first conjunct to the second conjunct in each scenario to see if the tendency for the first conjunct to be shorter was affected by the governor's position.</sample>

    <sample id="30">This paper proposes a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework called LLM-Blender for large language models. The key idea is based on pairwise ranking and generative fusion. The framework, developed by a team from AI2 and USC, aims to address the issue of selecting the optimal model for a particular input example. The authors argue that a single top-performing model may not be the best choice for every input, and that ensemble learning can lead to better results. The LLM-Blender framework consists of two stages: a pairwise ranking module called PairRanker, which compares the outputs of multiple models and ranks them based on their quality, and a generative fusion model, GenFuser, which takes the top-ranked models and generates a final output. The PairRanker module uses a cross-attention mechanism to compare pairs of models and learns to distinguish between them. The authors evaluate their framework on a new dataset called MixInstruct, which consists of instruction datasets and candidates from 11 open-source large language models. The results show that the LLM-Blender framework significantly outperforms individual models, including top-performing models like Open Assistant and Vicuna, on various metrics. The authors conclude that LLM-Blender is a promising framework for ensemble learning and release a unified codebase for evaluation and future research.</sample>

    <sample id="34">This presentation introduces CREST, a novel joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual text generation. It combines selective rationalization and counterfactual generation to produce valid, fluent, and diverse counterfactuals in a controllable way. The framework consists of two components: a rationalizer model that generates a meaningful rationale, and an editor that generates counterfactuals by editing specific parts of the input. The quality of the counterfactuals is evaluated through human evaluation and automatic metrics, showing that CREST produces more valid and natural counterfactuals compared to other approaches. 

Furthermore, the presentation explores the potential of CREST counterfactuals for data augmentation and proposes an alternative approach, CREST-Rationalization, which leverages paired factual and counterfactual examples to improve downstream models. The results show that CREST-Rationalization achieves top results on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Additionally, the analysis of the rationales generated by CREST reveals that they are more plausible and have higher counterfactual simulability compared to other approaches. Overall, CREST offers a new perspective on counterfactual text generation and rationalization, providing a valuable tool for understanding and improving the decision-making processes of machine learning models.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The paper "Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation" proposes a novel approach to increase the capacity of multilingual machine translation models while keeping inference costs constant. The authors introduce Language-Specific Layers (LSLs), which are regular transformer layers per language that can be selectively used at inference time based on the source or target language. This approach allows for more efficient use of model capacity, particularly for low-resource languages. The authors also explore the placement of LSLs within the encoder and propose a method to learn the optimal placement from a large model trained with all possible LSL configurations. The results show that the learned architecture outperforms baseline models and language adapters, with significant improvements for low-resource languages. The improvements are also statistically significant for 84 out of 90 translation directions. The paper presents a novel solution to the trade-off between model capacity and inference efficiency in multilingual machine translation, offering a promising direction for future research in this area. The approach has the potential to improve the performance of machine translation systems for a wide range of languages.</sample>

    <sample id="41">Researchers from the Natural Language Processing Lab at EPFL University and Sony Group Corporation have developed a large-scale Persona Commonsense Knowledge Graph (PeaCoK) to represent real-world personas with rich world knowledge and complex interconnections. PeaCoK contains over 3,800 personas, 40,000 attributes, and 100,000 personal inferences, with 9,200 attributes connected to two or more personas. The graph is built by selecting personas from existing commonsense graphs, inducing attributes from knowledge graphs and pre-trained language models, and crowdsourcing relation annotations. Expert study shows that PeaCoK's accuracy in F1 is 87% using a joint human-AI majority voting scheme. The researchers use PeaCoK to train a BART-based common knowledge generator, achieving better results than large-scale pre-trained language models on persona attribute inference tasks. They also explore using PeaCoK to improve downstream narrative modeling, such as dialogue generation, and find that it yields more consistent and engaging conversations. The study demonstrates that PeaCoK can serve as a reliable persona knowledge base, enabling lightweight language models to learn knowledge generation capabilities comparable to large-scale language models.

    <sample id="50">A new corpus for German text identification, called DEPLAIN, was introduced to improve text comprehension for specific target groups, such as people with reading problems or non-native speakers. The corpus consists of two subcorpora: DEPLAIN-apa, based on news texts with 13,000 parallel sentence pairs, and DEPLAIN-web, covering various domains with 30,450 sentence pairs. The corpus was created to address issues with existing corpora, which were either too small or relied on automatic alignment methods that can be error-prone.

The DEPLAIN corpus was used to evaluate automatic alignment methods and fine-tune language models for automatic text simplification. The best automatic alignment method for German text simplification was found to be MASSalign. Additionally, fine-tuning language models was shown to produce simplified text with better scores than baseline models. The results were proposed as a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification. The DEPLAIN corpus is a valuable resource for researchers and developers working on text simplification tasks, providing a large and manually aligned dataset for training and evaluating models.</sample>

    <sample id="54">Cognitive dissonance, a phenomenon where two conflicting beliefs or actions exist, is a common occurrence in daily decision-making but rarely expressed in language. Studying dissonance can provide insights into disagreement, attitude changes, and mental health, particularly in understanding extremism and polarization. However, annotating dissonance relations is challenging due to their rarity. 

This paper presents a long paper accepted into ACL 2023, "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare-Class Challenge." The authors developed a cognitive dissonance resource through large-scale annotation and employed a dissonance-first approach. The initial classifier performed poorly due to the low occurrence of dissonance. To alleviate this, the authors experimented with combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate more dissonant samples efficiently.

The study found that transferring weights from closely related tasks, such as topic-independent dissonance stance classification and binary classification of expansion and comparison classes, significantly improved zero-shot performance. The authors also determined the best method to update a model with new data from each round of active learning, finding that "Cumulative" performed better than "Iterative" across the board. A proposed Probability-of-Rare-Class strategy was found to be effective in selecting examples likely to be dissonant, resulting in improved dissonance classification AUC to 0.75.</sample>

DrBERT is based on RoBERTa and trained on NACHOS, a dataset of medical crawled data from the web. The authors compare DrBERT with other models, including ChuBERT, which is based on anonymized clinical data. They also investigate the impact of pre-training strategy and the effect of data size on model performance. The study evaluates seven models on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French, including named entity recognition, classification, and question answering. The results show that models perform best on tasks with data of the same nature as their training data, but data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile. The study also finds that using more data leads to better performance, and from-scratch pre-training obtains higher performance on most tasks. The authors conclude that DrBERT outperforms the generic model, CamemBERT, on nine out of 11 downstream tasks. The pre-trained models and training scripts are freely available on Hugging Face and GitHub, respectively. This study contributes to the development of specialized language models for French biomedical and clinical domains, addressing the lack of open-source models in these areas.</sample>

    <sample id="62">This paper presents a systematic study of knowledge distillation for natural language generation (NLG) tasks, aiming to compress large language models while preserving their performance. The authors explore various NLG tasks, including summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, and simplification and style transfer, using a medium-resource labeled dataset and large amounts of unlabeled data. They consider industry-driven setups, prioritizing inference time efficiency and practicality. 

The study consists of eight stages, focusing on architectural decisions, pruning, knowledge selection, and state-of-the-art baselines. The main contribution lies in the exploration of pseudo-targets, challenging traditional sequence-level knowledge distillation. The authors demonstrate the importance of unlabeled data, generating multiple pseudo-targets, and sampling pseudo-targets with high temperature to expose the student to more diverse knowledge. They also propose a novel knowledge distillation technique, joint-teaching, which addresses student exposure bias and grounded learning. Joint-teaching applies word-level knowledge distillation on pseudo-targets generated by both the teacher and the student. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of knowledge distillation for NLG tasks, offering a recipe for distillation in NLG.</sample>

    <sample id="66">This paper surveys the development of deep learning methods for mathematical reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this area, with the task of mathematical reasoning categorized into visual and tabular contexts. The authors discuss the challenges of solving geometric problems and automated theorem proving, highlighting the need for neuro-symbolic reasoning over geometric diagrams, theorems, and solvers. They also explore the use of sequence-to-sequence models, sequence-to-tree models, and pre-trained language models (LLMs) to solve math word problems. However, LLMs face limitations, including the lack of ability to perform precise mathematical reasoning. To address this, the authors propose the use of self-consistency and program-aided LMMs, which can be augmented with various tools to perform complex tasks. The paper also touches on the need for non-English datasets and benchmarks for financial, scientific, and medical domains. Despite progress, language models commonly display generalization and robustness failures on reasoning tasks, particularly with large numbers and inconsistent mathematical reasoning. The authors conclude by highlighting the importance of continued research in this area to develop more robust and generalizable models.</sample>
    <sample id="67">In multilingual translation models, interference can occur when training on multiple languages, leading to decreased performance. This study investigates the factors contributing to interference and synergy in multilingual translation models. The researchers identify model and data size as the primary factors affecting interference levels, with severe interference occurring in parameter poverty settings. They find that language similarity and the number of languages have a limited impact on interference. To mitigate interference, the study proposes temperature sampling as a simple yet effective solution, allowing for more training examples to be sampled from lower-resource languages. The results show that tuned temperature is key for strong performance, and that modest scale and tuned temperature can significantly reduce interference without the need for specialized methods. The study concludes that model and data size are the primary factors affecting interference levels, and that temperature sampling is a crucial factor in achieving strong performance in multilingual translation models. The findings provide valuable insights for improving the performance of multilingual translation models.</sample>

The dataset consists of 6,000 alternative questions across three domains: music, books, and recipes, with 42,000 indirect referring expressions. The corpus was collected using a crowd annotation methodology, where annotators were provided with a dialogue context and asked to select one of two entities using an indirect reference. The dataset is designed to capture the nuances of human language when making choices, and to evaluate the ability of language models to understand indirect references. Experiments using the T5 XL model showed that when the model has access to the same background knowledge as the annotators, it achieves high accuracy (92-95%). However, when the model has access to partially overlapping background knowledge, accuracy drops to 82-87%. The results also demonstrate that the models are domain-generalizable. The AltEntities Corpus provides a valuable resource for benchmarking language models' entity understanding and improving conversational systems.</sample>

    <sample id="74">This paper presents Dense-ATOMIC, a densely-connected commonsense knowledge graph constructed upon the ATOMIC knowledge base. ATOMIC is a large-scale knowledge base covering event-centered social aspects, but its sparse graph structure and limited multi-hop paths hinder its effectiveness. Dense-ATOMIC addresses these limitations by inferring missing links and constructing multi-hop paths. The construction process involves normalizing tail events, training a relation prediction model, and constructing Dense-ATOMIC. A novel relation prediction model, Rel-CSKGC, is proposed to predict relations given head and tail events. Rel-CSKGC utilizes semantic information and avoids graph structure limitations. To efficiently infer missing links, an Intra- and Inter-Cluster Completion Strategy is designed. The performance of Rel-CSKGC is evaluated against relation prediction and translation-based methods, outperforming them on automatic and human evaluation. Dense-ATOMIC is also evaluated, showing improved knowledge coverage and benefiting the performance of COMET. The results demonstrate the potential of Dense-ATOMIC in commonsense reasoning and its advantages in knowledge coverage and multi-hop paths. The paper concludes by providing the code and website for further exploration.</sample>
    <sample id="75">Zheng Yandan presents Jointprop, a joint semi-supervised learning framework for name entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) tasks. Current studies neglect the interconnections between NER and RE, which can lead to missing label alignment and incorrect pseudo-label inference. Jointprop addresses this issue by fully exploiting the connections among labeled and unlabeled data, and between labeled and unlabeled data. The framework consists of four parts: span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. 

In the joint label propagation process, labels are propagated to entity or relation candidates in the unlabeled data through a heterogeneous graph, refining pseudo-labels until convergence. The converged pseudo-labels are then filtered and combined with the label data to retrain the classification model. 

Experiments were conducted on four datasets, including joint-task and single-task datasets, and showed that joint learning of the two tasks benefits from the codependency between them in joint datasets. For single-task datasets, Jointprop achieved significant and consistent improvement over all baselines for both NER and RE tasks. Overall, Jointprop provides a novel approach to semi-supervised joint NER and RE, leveraging the connections between the two tasks to improve performance.</sample>

    <sample id="77">Researchers from Yale University and Microsoft Research have developed a new dataset, DeFacto, to improve the factual consistency of summarization models. The dataset contains human demonstrations and feedback for improving summarization factual consistency, collected from the XSum dataset. The study proposes three new Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. 

The team collected 2,500 data points, with 70% containing factual errors. Human-edited summaries received higher automatic factuality scores compared to initial system outputs but showed lower textual overlap with reference summaries. The study found that fine-tuned models and zero-shot large language models can effectively leverage human feedback for summary editing, while feedback generation remains a challenging task.

The researchers also found that the editor model can achieve comparable performance to baseline models in automatically correcting factual errors, and training the model to generate explanations can improve performance. The DeFacto dataset provides a valuable resource for training factuality metrics and factuality meta-evaluation. The dataset has been released on GitHub, and the study's findings are detailed in the paper "On Improving Summarization Factual Consistency from Natural Language Feedback."</sample>

    <sample id="82">This paper proposes a novel framework, Unsupervised Learning from Rank Aggregation (ULRA), for automated essay scoring (AES) without human intervention. Traditional AES models rely on large labeled corpora, but collecting these labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. ULRA aims to overcome this limitation by aggregating multiple heuristic quality signals as pseudo-groundtruth to train a neural AES model. The proposed framework consists of two main components: a heuristic essay ranking module (HER) and a deep pairwise rank aggregation module (DPRA). HER generates partial-order pairs by ranking essays according to multiple classic quality signals, while DPRA trains a neural AES model by aggregating these pairs into a unified supervision. To address conflicts among different signals, a deep pairwise rank aggregation loss is designed to set learnable confidence weights for each signal. Experimental results on both transductive and inductive settings demonstrate that ULRA outperforms all unsupervised baselines with a large improvement, achieving competitive performance compared to cross-prompt and one-shot methods. Although ULRA's performance is lower than that of general supervised methods due to the lack of strong supervision, it provides a promising solution for unsupervised essay scoring.</sample>

    <sample id="84">Title: PAD-Net: An Efficient Framework for Dynamic Networks

Abstract:

Traditional networks are static, with fixed parameters that cannot change with input values. In contrast, dynamic networks can adapt their architecture or parameters based on the input. However, fully dynamic networks can lead to excessive parameter usage, limiting their application. This paper proposes PAD-Net, a Partially Dynamic Network framework that partitions parameters into dynamic and static components. The framework uses Iterative Mode Partition to identify redundant dynamic parameters, which are then transformed into static parameters. This approach aims to maintain or exceed the representation power of the original network while reducing parameters and computation. Experiments show that PAD-Net outperforms static and dynamic networks, and maintains fewer parameters and less computation compared to fully dynamic networks. Ablation studies reveal the importance of Dynamic Ratios and Scale Factors in achieving optimal performance. Compared to network pruning, PAD-Net demonstrates significantly better performance due to the preservation of static parameters. The proposed framework is also found to produce more discriminative outputs, contributing to its improved performance. Future works include extending PAD-Net to other mainstream networks, exploring hardware-friendly structured manners, and introducing additional modes such as zero elements and static parameters.</sample>

    <sample id="90">This study challenges the conventional notion that native speakers are essential for data annotation in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The authors of "Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?" conducted a proof-of-concept study to examine the feasibility of using language learners as annotators. They recruited learners of English, Korean, and Indonesian, and native speakers, and had them annotate tasks from the GLUE benchmark. The study found that labels annotated by language learners were nearly accurate, especially for simpler tasks, and that their aggregated labels were almost on par with those of native speakers. Furthermore, training simulations showed that language models trained on learners' less accurate labels achieved about 95% of ground truth performance and sometimes outperformed models trained with native speakers' labels. The study also observed that learners' language proficiency improved as they carried out the annotation tasks. The findings suggest that language learners can contribute to NLP annotations, offering a novel way to build benchmark datasets for low-resource languages where native speakers are hard to recruit. This study has the potential to broaden NLP research and overcome geographic and technological barriers.</sample>

    <sample id="94">This paper proposes a novel backdoor-based watermark method called "Embedding Marker" to protect the copyright of large language models used in embedding as services. Embedding as services is a technique that leverages large language models, such as GPT and LLAMA, to assist various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, recent works have shown that attackers can steal the model by learning from the embedding and provide similar services. To address this issue, the Embedding Marker method embeds a watermark in the provider service and detects whether another service contains the watermark. The method consists of two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification. In watermark injection, a target embedding is defined, and the provided embedding is a weight summation of the target embedding and the original embedding, where the weight is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence. In copyright verification, a backdoor dataset and a benign dataset are constructed, and the similarities between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. The authors conduct experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the Embedding Marker can achieve great detection performance while maintaining great utility for downstream tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="100">The talk discusses PromptRank, a data-efficient approach for multi-hop question answering (QA) that addresses the issue of requiring thousands of examples for good performance. Existing state-of-the-art multi-hop retrievers are trained by maximizing the probability of ground-truth chains given questions, but this can be expensive and challenging, especially for low-resource domains. PromptRank combines an unsupervised retrieval method with a few-shot language model-based reranker to achieve good performance with as few as 128 examples. The approach involves retrieving candidate chains using TF-IDF retrieval and hyperlink traversal, and then reranking these candidates using a language model reranker. The scoring function used is the likelihood of the question given the chain according to a language model, and the instruction plays a strong role in eliciting the language model's reasoning abilities. The talk presents results showing that PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and performs comparably to state-of-the-art multi-hop dense retrievers. The approach also exhibits strong downstream multi-hop QA performance when used as a retriever with a reader model.</sample>

    <sample id="106">The paper presents the QUEST dataset, a retrieval dataset designed to study the effectiveness of systems handling selective information needs with implicit set constraints. The dataset consists of over 3,000 entity-seeking queries with verified answer entities and attributable spans for query constraints. The queries are constructed by performing set operations over Wikipedia category names from four domains: films, books, plants, and animals. Human annotators paraphrased the queries, validated their fluency, and verified the relevance of answer entities with marked evidence from documents. To evaluate systems, the dataset requires multi-answer sets from a large document corpus with implicit set constraints and evidence from multiple parts of the document. Baseline systems, including sparse and dense retrievers, and a T5-based reranker, demonstrate a large room for improvement in retriever performance and end-to-end system performance. Analysis reveals that queries with set intersection and set difference are particularly challenging. The QUEST dataset aims to help researchers build improved systems for information-seeking scenarios with selective information needs, such as Jane's query for a red reptile species or Austin's search for historical fiction novels set in France.</sample>

    <sample id="108">This ACL 2023 paper revisits the minimal pair paradigm (MPP) for evaluating language models on acceptability judgments. The current MPP pipeline is limited to evaluating short sentences, but large language models now operate with longer context windows. To address this, the authors simulate longer sequences by recreating sentences with grammatical or ungrammatical structures from relevant datasets. They test the models' acceptability judgments in various scenarios, including mismatched and unrelated contexts. 

The results show that MPP judgments are relatively robust to arbitrary context length, but sensitive to context when the sentences come from the same dataset or have the same structure. The model's acceptability judgments significantly increase or decrease when adding acceptable or unacceptable prefixes, respectively. However, when the prefix structure matches, the effect is massive, increasing throughout the context length. 

Analysis of perturbed input sentences reveals that the model's sensitivity to noise is consistent across acceptable and unacceptable domains. The authors conclude that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences. The current MPP evaluation may not capture the models' abstract knowledge throughout the context window, highlighting the need for more comprehensive evaluation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="109">This paper introduces Unnatural Instructions, a large dataset of natural language instructions and their corresponding inputs and outputs, collected in a fully automatic manner without human annotations. The dataset was generated by prompting a pre-trained language model to produce instructions, inputs, and outputs, and further diversified through paraphrasing. With over 240,000 examples, Unnatural Instructions contains a diverse range of tasks, including creative and unconventional tasks such as verifying scientific experiment design and inventing new words. The authors analyze the dataset's quality, finding that more than 50% of the generated examples are correct, and even incorrect examples contain valuable information for instruction tuning. To evaluate the utility of the dataset, the authors fine-tune a large T5 model on Unnatural Instructions and show that it outperforms other models on several benchmarks, including Super-Natural Instructions, T0, BIG-Bench Hard, and LMentry. The results demonstrate the potential of language models to produce high-quality data, which can be obtained at a lower cost and faster pace than human annotations. The Unnatural Instructions dataset provides a valuable resource for instruction tuning and natural language processing research.</sample>

    <sample id="114">Researchers from Nanyang Technological University of Singapore presented their work, "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention," at ACL 2023. The study focuses on addressing the limitations of large language models, particularly the heavy parameters, which hinder their deployability and efficiency. The team proposed a grouped head attention mechanism, which utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to compress multi-head attention. The model consists of two stages: group-constrained training and the Voting-to-Stay algorithm. The first stage divides attention heads into groups, making intra-group heads more similar and inter-group heads more separate. The second stage prunes redundant heads using a voting system. The proposed model, GHT, achieves significant parameter compression, with up to 90% reduction, while maintaining comparable performance. Evaluation on machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization tasks shows promising results, with 3.8% to 7% BLEU improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. The study also demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed model, with 62% faster inference speed and 80% fewer FLOPs. The researchers believe that task-specific automatic pruning is a promising direction for future work, allowing for the pruning of redundant parameters in large language models without sacrificing performance.</sample>

    <sample id="118">This paper presents "Improving Pretraining Techniques for Code-Switched NLP," a submission to the ACL 2023 conference. Code-switching, a common phenomenon in linguistically diverse communities, refers to the practice of alternating between two or more languages within a sentence. The authors highlight the limitations of existing multilingual pre-trained models, such as mBERT and XLM-R, in handling code-switched tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. To address this, they propose a novel masked language modeling (MLM) technique called SwitchMLM, which is specifically designed to handle code-switching. SwitchMLM identifies "switch-points," or transitions between languages, and masks only these words, rather than all words with uniform probability. The authors also introduce a surrogate method, FrequencyMLM, which uses monolingual corpora to assign language IDs (LIDs) to words. Additionally, they propose architectural modifications, including residual connections and an auxiliary LID-based loss, to enhance the model's ability to capture switch-point information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed methods, particularly on sentiment analysis tasks. The paper also presents probing experiments to verify the increased presence of switch-point information in intermediate and final layers. Overall, the authors provide a comprehensive approach to improving pretraining techniques for code-switched NLP.</sample>

    <sample id="123">In this research, Ying and Zhiyang present MultiInstruct, a novel multi-modal instruction tuning benchmark dataset consisting of 62 diverse tasks covering 10 broad categories. This dataset is designed to investigate whether instruction tuning can improve generalization to unseen multi-modal tasks. The authors take OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as their base model and formulate tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format to unify the processing of various input and output data types. 

In their experiments, the authors demonstrate that instruction tuning can significantly improve OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks and that transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can benefit instruction tuning. They also introduce a new metric called sensitivity to measure the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variations in instruction wording. The results show that using more instructions can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity. Furthermore, transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can help OFA achieve better performance and sensitivity. The authors propose MultiInstruct as the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset and explore different transfer learning techniques, showcasing their benefits.</sample>
    <sample id="124">A research study, "Towards Benchmarking and Improving the Temporal Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models," was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The study proposed a novel dataset, TempReason, which covers three levels of temporal reasoning: time-to-time, time-to-event, and event-to-event. The dataset consists of over 130,000 question-answer pairs and spans a long temporal coverage. The study evaluated the performance of four LLMs, including ChatGPT, in three question-answering (QA) settings: Closed Book QA, Open Book QA, and Reasoning QA. The results showed that ChatGPT demonstrated a strong bias towards the 2000-2020 time period and struggled with month prediction. To improve temporal reasoning, the study proposed a training strategy with two components: Temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning. The proposed model, TempT5, significantly outperformed the baseline models in all QA settings, especially in the Reasoning QA setting. The study highlights the importance of comprehensive temporal reasoning and proposes a new benchmark dataset and training paradigm to improve the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</sample>

The method involves applying chain-of-thought prompting on large models to generate step-by-step solutions for complex tasks, which are then used as training data to fine-tune smaller models. A novel technique called "Diverse Reasoning" is also introduced, where multiple reasoning samples are generated using stochastic temperature sampling, allowing smaller models to learn from diverse solutions. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on 12 tasks, achieving notable performance and outperforming existing baselines. The method is also shown to be highly scalable, with various ways to improve performance, such as using more datasets, better teacher models, or larger student models. However, trade-offs between development costs, inference costs, and quality of inference must be considered. The researchers provide code and data for their experiments, encouraging future work and discussion.</sample>
    <sample id="128">This presentation discusses a new diagnostic test suite, called KITMUS, for evaluating the ability of natural language understanding models to integrate knowledge from multiple sources. The test suite focuses on coreference resolution, a task that requires models to draw on both pretraining-time knowledge and inference-time knowledge. The authors propose three settings for KITMUS, varying the availability of background knowledge and entity-specific knowledge. They evaluate the test suite with human study participants and established coreference resolution models, and find that most models perform poorly without task-specific training. However, with task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources. The results suggest that even the best-performing models struggle to reliably integrate background knowledge provided only at inference time. The KITMUS test suite and data set are made available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers to evaluate the ability of natural language understanding models to integrate knowledge from multiple sources. This work highlights the importance of task-specific training for achieving robust performance in knowledge-intensive NLU tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="135">ABC-Eval is a novel dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI, developed by the Emory NLP Lab in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. This method aims to provide a more precise and reliable evaluation of chat models by explicitly annotating specific behaviors, such as irrelevant information, self-contradiction, and common sense violations. ABC-Eval measures the rates at which chat models commit various thematic errors, including ignoring partners, hallucinating incorrect facts, and violating common sense knowledge. The approach was tested on four state-of-the-art chat models, evaluated on 100 human-bot conversations per model, and compared to three existing methods: Likert ratings on the turn-level, Likert ratings on the dialogue-level, and dialogue-level pairwise comparisons. The results show that ABC-Eval behavior labels are more reliable and predictive of overall conversation quality compared to existing methods. The combination of ABC-Eval metrics explains over 25% of conversation quality, highlighting the potential of this approach to evaluate conversational AI with higher resolution. The study also identifies challenges, such as common sense violations and irrelevant information, which future models may address. ABC-Eval is proposed as a meaningful step towards developing reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing conversational AI models.</sample>
    <sample id="136">Jasivan presents the work "FERMAT: An Alternative to Accuracy for Numerical Reasoning" conducted with supervisor Nafise at the University of Sheffield. The motivation behind this work is to address the limitations of existing numerical reasoning benchmarks, which often rely on accuracy scores and F1 measures that do not provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of models. The authors introduce FERMAT, a flexible evaluation set based on arithmetic types, which includes number understanding, mathematical operation, and training dependency aspects. FERMAT consists of maths worded questions extracted from Illinois and CommonCore, with variations in number representation and mathematical operations. The authors perform a baseline evaluation and fine-tuning using math teacher-written templates, which improves model performance. They also investigate the impact of training templates and find that language and mathematical diversity are crucial for improving performance. The study concludes that existing benchmarks are unrepresentative and that FERMAT provides a more informative alternative. The authors highlight the importance of number encoding and tokenization as areas for improvement.</sample>
    <sample id="137">Researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design propose a novel machine learning task, language-guided floor plan generation, where a model generates 2D floor plan designs directly from language instructions. The task is defined as a sequence-to-sequence problem under the encoder-decoder framework, where the input is a set of natural language instructions and the output is a structured interior layout that aligns with the input instructions. The team collects a large-scale dataset, Tell2Design, consisting of 5,051 human-annotated language instructions and 76,000 artificially generated instructions. 

A sequence-to-sequence model is proposed as a strong baseline, initialized by a pre-trained language model T5, to better understand language instructions. The model outperforms text-conditional image generation baselines by a large margin, achieving a Micro IoU of 54 and a Macro IoU of 53 on the Tell2Design dataset. However, the model performs poorly when trained on artificial instructions and tested on human-written ones, indicating a language distribution gap. The study demonstrates that artificial and human interactions are mutually beneficial data portions during training. The proposed task and dataset provide a foundation for future research on language-guided design generation, enabling users to design by "telling" instructions and enhancing the design process.</sample>

    <sample id="146">Yicheng, a PhD student from Fudan University, presented a paper on the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization. The study aims to address the common error of omission in dialogue summarization, where critical facts are lost in generated summaries. The analysis revealed that even state-of-the-art models reach a high omission rate of around 70%, indicating a general and serious problem in dialogue summarization. To better understand and solve this issue, the authors developed the OLDS dataset, which provides high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. The dataset is built upon five existing benchmarks covering five domains and includes 10 diverse candidate summaries generated by different models and decoding strategies.

The authors explored three baseline frameworks for omission detection, including pair-wise classification, sequence labeling, and pointer network. The results showed a challenging task with an F1-score of around 50%, indicating the need for more advanced detection models. The study also demonstrated the potential of using omissions to refine summaries, with a post-editing method that boosts summary quality when omission is provided. The findings suggest that omission detection is a valuable task, and refinement based on detected omission is a promising direction for quality improvement in dialogue summarization.</sample>

Meeting transcripts are a vast and underutilized domain for NLP research, offering a unique opportunity for QA models to learn from real-life discussions. The MeetingQA dataset consists of 7.7K questions with corresponding answer sentences, covering various scenarios such as multiple speakers, discontinuous sentences, and rhetorical questions. The dataset is split into Train, Dev, and Test sets, with 30% of questions being unanswerable and 40% having multispan answers. The authors achieve a high human performance on the Test set with an F1 score of 84.6.

The paper explores various methods for QA models, including context-retrieval, single-span, and multi-span models. In the fine-tuned setting, short-context models like RoBERTa outperform long-context models like Longformer. However, there is a significant gap between fine-tuned models and human performance. The authors also investigate zero-shot performance, where silver data augmentation improves results. Error analysis reveals challenges in identifying rhetorical questions, irrelevant sentences, and speaker identification, particularly in the zero-shot setting. MeetingQA is a challenging dataset that pushes the limits of existing QA models, offering opportunities for future research and improvement.</sample>
    <sample id="152">Researchers in the field of classical philology have developed new language models specifically designed to process Ancient Greek and Latin texts. The team aimed to create models that surpass existing state-of-the-art performance, explore different architectures, and introduce multilingual models. They pre-trained two monolingual models, GreBERTa and GreTa, for Ancient Greek, and two multilingual models, PhilBERTa and PhilTa, for Ancient Greek, Latin, and English. The team gathered pre-training data from Open Greek &amp; Latin, additional resources, and a new corpus from the Internet Archive. They leveraged OCR settings and post-processing to create a high-quality pre-training corpus. The models were benchmarked on tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and lemmatization, and demonstrated significant improvements over existing models. The researchers also analyzed the performance of GreTa's encoder and found that it approaches the performance of a native encoder-only model after more training. The multilingual model showed no significant difference in performance compared to the monolingual models. The new language models are designed to be powerful tools for classical philology, enabling scholars to process and analyze Ancient Greek and Latin texts more efficiently.</sample>
    <sample id="153">This study focuses on resolving ambiguities in text-to-image generative models, which are crucial for faithful image generation. The researchers, from Amazon Alexa AI's Responsible AI team, present a work titled "Resolving Ambiguities in Text-to-Image Generative Models." They propose frameworks to mitigate and evaluate ambiguities in prompts provided to text-to-image models. The study begins by curating a benchmark dataset, a modified version of the LAVA corpus, which covers various types of ambiguities. The dataset is used to develop a prompt disambiguation framework, which gathers external signals to disambiguate the prompt through clarifying questions or generating different possible visual setups. The disambiguated prompts are then evaluated using a VQA model, which assesses whether the generated images are faithful to user intention. The study reveals disparities in resolving ambiguities for different types of ambiguities and shows that disambiguation using the proposed framework has a positive effect on faithful generation. The automatic evaluation framework is also found to be reliable, agreeing with human evaluation. This work aims to improve text-to-image models by addressing ambiguities and providing a reliable evaluation framework.</sample>

    <sample id="157">This presentation introduces a novel dialogue summarization model, "Dialogue Summarization with Static-Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph" (SDDS), developed by a team of researchers from Shandong University. The SDDS model aims to distill the salient information from a dialogue context into a concise summary, addressing the challenges of existing methods that heavily rely on pre-computed static graph structures and external linguistic tools. The proposed model consists of four main components: Utterance Encoder, Static-Dynamic Graph module, and Summary Generator. The Static-Dynamic Graph module combines multiple static graphs computed using heuristic dialogue structure modeling methods, such as Discourse Parsing Graph and Utterance Position Graph, with a dynamic graph module that captures semantic relationships between utterances using multi-head attention. The model also employs a pre-trained language model as the Summary Generator to fuse the static and dynamic dialogue structures into a final summary. The SDDS model is designed to dynamically adapt to the downstream dialogue summarization task, addressing the limitations of existing methods and improving the accuracy of dialogue summarization. The code and data have been released on GitHub for further research and development.</sample>
    <sample id="158">A novel approach to neural coreference resolution, known as "Dual Cache," is proposed to efficiently handle long documents. The task of coreference resolution involves identifying mentions and clustering them into entities that refer to the same entity. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity, while cache-based methods reduce it to a linear level but suffer from high cache misses due to topic switching in long documents. The proposed Dual Cache system consists of a local cache using LRU eviction policy and a global cache using LFU policy. It scans the document from left to right, classifying new mentions and evaluating their frequency. Qualified entities are added to the global cache, while others are added to the local cache. Evaluation on four public benchmarks shows that Dual Cache outperforms baselines, even with unbounded memory, and significantly reduces cache misses. The approach is particularly effective for book-level documents, demonstrating a substantial performance gap between the baseline and Dual Cache. Overall, Dual Cache offers a cost-effective solution to neural coreference resolution, achieving the highest performance/cost ratio among cache-based methods.</sample>

    <sample id="165">Wenting Zhao, a PhD student at Cornell University, presents a paper titled "Abductive Commonsense Reasoning Exploiting Mutually Exclusive Explanations". Abductive reasoning aims to identify a plausible explanation bridging the information gap between a given context and outcome. Traditional approaches rely on supervised methods, which require annotated explanations and can be noisy and subjective. To address this issue, the authors introduce an unsupervised learning method called LiPoR (Likelihood Learning with Posterior Regularization). LiPoR treats explanations as latent variables and maximizes the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context. However, this objective alone does not prefer plausible explanations, so a regularizer is added to enforce mutual exclusivity among explanations. The LiPoR objective consists of two parts: maximizing the likelihood of outcomes and preferring some explanations over others. Experimental results on the AlphaNLI dataset show that LiPoR outperforms zero-shot models and the previous best unsupervised approach by over 4 absolute points in accuracy. The authors demonstrate that abductive reasoning can be learned without supervision regarding the plausibility of explanations, opening up new possibilities for this field.</sample>

The Proposition Generator decomposes complex proposition texts into simple propositions, while the Visual-Linguistic Interactor performs visual-propositions' information interaction. The Neural-Symbolic Reasoner, as System 2, integrates reasoning states and results to obtain the final solution. The proposed method outperforms other baselines in experimental results and verifies the effectiveness of each module through abolition experiments. Case studies demonstrate the method's ability to present inference states and results in the middle step, ensuring interoperability. The researchers suggest that neural symbolic calculation and Divide-and-Conquer strategy can be integrated with Dual-Process Theory to improve compositional reasoning and planning of large language models. The proposed NDCR framework provides a new approach to addressing the challenge of image retrieval from linguistically complex text descriptions.</sample>

    <sample id="169">The paper "Prompting PaLM for Translation: Assessing Strategies and Performance" presents a systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation. The researchers evaluated the transition capability of PaLM, a 540 billion-parameter large language model, using best practices from the machine translation community. They compared PaLM's performance to state-of-the-art systems on the WMT evaluation and used both neural MT metrics and human evaluation results. The study found that the prompting strategy has a significant impact on PaLM's performance, with a 5-shot prompting strategy showing the best results. The researchers also found that the quality of the examples used for prompting is more important than their similarity to the source sentence. The human evaluation results showed that PaLM's fluency is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but its accuracy is lower due to omission errors. The study concludes that PaLM comes close to commercial systems like Google Translate, but still has some problems with accuracy. The researchers provide recommendations for prompt selection strategies and highlight the importance of selecting high-quality examples for prompting. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the use of large language models for machine translation and the importance of careful prompting strategies.</sample>

    <sample id="174">This presentation introduces ArgAnalysis35K, a large-scale dataset for Argument Quality Analysis. The dataset is unique in its high-quality arguments, diverse range of arguments, and analysis component, which explains why an argument is true. Unlike existing datasets, ArgAnalysis35K is sourced from high-quality tournaments, expert debaters, and novice debaters, providing a more comprehensive understanding of argument quality. The dataset is also diverse, with 24 themes and a wide range of motions. 

The analysis component is a key feature of the dataset, representing a combination of claims, premises, and explanations. This component is introduced to the NLP community and allows for a deeper understanding of argument quality. Additionally, the dataset employs instance-based annotator reliability, which captures annotators' biases and eliminates biased judgments on a per-instance basis. 

Lastly, the dataset includes a relevance model, which assigns a score to each argument based on its relevance to a particular theme. This model captures the complexity of argument relevance and allows for more accurate scoring. Overall, ArgAnalysis35K provides a comprehensive and reliable dataset for argument quality analysis, offering a unique combination of high-quality arguments, diverse range of arguments, and advanced analysis features. The dataset has the potential to revolutionize the field of argument quality analysis and NLP.</sample>

    <sample id="179">The paper "Minding Language Models’ (Lack of) Theory of Mind: A Plug-and-Play Multi-Character Belief Tracker" investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to reason about the mental states of others, a concept known as Theory of Mind (ToM). Traditional ToM tests, such as the Sally-Anne test, involve false-belief questions that require understanding the mental states of multiple characters. LLMs, including ChatGPT and GPT-3, have been shown to perform poorly on these tasks. To address this, the authors propose SymbolicToM, an inference-time method that uses explicit graphical representations to improve ToM reasoning skills in LLMs. The method computes graphical representations of mental states for all combinations of characters and can efficiently answer questions about their beliefs. The authors test SymbolicToM on a range of LLMs and compare its performance to supervised baselines, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy across the board. They also evaluate the method's generalization capabilities on out-of-domain story understanding and linguistic diversity datasets, showing that it outperforms supervised approaches and remains beneficial even in the presence of linguistic variation. The results suggest that SymbolicToM is a promising approach for improving ToM reasoning skills in LLMs.</sample>

    <sample id="181">This study focuses on the problem of constrained language planning, where abstract goals are decomposed into step-by-step instructions under specific constraints. Unlike previous work that mainly focuses on planning for stereotypical activities, this research aims to plan for goals with multi-faceted constraints. To address this challenge, the authors evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models. They extend abstract goals with multi-faceted constraints and acquire specific goals using human-in-the-loop data acquisition with InstructGPT. The results show that large language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals, with low faithfulness to constraints.

To improve the generation quality, the authors adopt the over-generate-then-filter method. They first show constraint types with examples for InstructGPT and obtain specific goals based on seed abstract goals. Then, a filter model is developed to select faithful scripts. The proposed method greatly improves the planning ability of large language models in both semantic completeness and faithfulness to constraints. Furthermore, the authors create a high-quality dataset, CoScript, by distilling constrained language planning datasets from large language models. They demonstrate that smaller models, such as T5 fine-tuned on CoScript, can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models, indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable datasets.</sample>

    <sample id="192">This presentation introduces the Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization (CAME) algorithm, a novel optimizer designed to balance fast convergence and low memory usage in large language model training. Traditional adaptive optimizers like Adam rely on auxiliary memory to store moment estimates, while memory-efficient optimizers like Adafactor incur performance penalties. CAME addresses these limitations by leveraging non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to reduce memory requirements and introducing a confidence-guided updating mechanism to adaptively handle erroneous updates. The proposed approach calculates the instability between predicted and generated updates, using this residual as a denominator to update the momentum. Experiments on BookCorpus and English Wikipedia demonstrate the effectiveness of CAME, achieving significant improvements in validation accuracy and memory efficiency compared to Adam and Adafactor. CAME also outperforms existing memory-efficient optimizers like SM3 in terms of memory footprint. The results show that CAME achieves comparable performance to the baseline on typical downstream tasks while reducing memory cost, making it a promising solution for large language model training tasks, especially for large batch sizes.</sample>

    <sample id="195">This work proposes a novel framework, RoHT (Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree), for explainable question answering (XQA). XQA aims to answer questions and provide explanations for the selected answers. Current XQA methods have limitations, including neuro-symbolic methods that rely on structured knowledge bases and decompose-based methods that struggle with diverse natural language. RoHT addresses these challenges by introducing a two-stage framework. Firstly, it builds a Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT) to understand the compositional structure of complex questions. Secondly, it performs probabilistic reasoning over the HQDT to fuse knowledge from knowledge bases and text corpora at different levels. The framework determines the granularity of question decomposition, selects the appropriate knowledge source for each sub-question, and finds the optimal solution among various possible ones. RoHT is evaluated on two challenging complex QA datasets, KQA Pro and Musique, and outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in integrating knowledge from heterogeneous sources and providing explanations for the selected answers. The results show that RoHT can improve the accuracy of XQA and provide a promising direction for future research in this area.</sample>

    <sample id="205">This study investigates the propagation of political biases in language models, from pretraining data to downstream tasks. The researchers propose a pipeline to evaluate the political leaning of language models and examine how they perform on downstream tasks, such as hate speech detection and fake news detection. The study finds that language models exhibit varying political leanings, with GPT-4 being the most liberal. Further pretraining language models on partisan corpora reveals that their ideological coordinates shift accordingly. The study also finds that language models can pick up polarization in society, with models trained on post-2017 data exhibiting more extreme political leanings. When evaluating language models on hate speech and fake news detection, the researchers find that left-leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting minority groups, while right-leaning models are better at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups. However, this also means that left-leaning models are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups, and vice versa. The study highlights a pressing fairness issue regarding language model political leanings and proposes a dilemma between sanitizing political opinions in training data and risking censorship or exclusion.</sample>

    <sample id="215">This paper presents a novel argument for symmetric structures of coordination in English, challenging the widely accepted asymmetric approaches. The authors analyze the principle of dependency length minimization, which states that shorter dependencies are preferred. They demonstrate that this principle can explain the acceptability of sentences with long direct objects and adjuncts, even when they violate the general grammatical principle of direct objects being close to the verb.

The authors also examine statistics from the enhanced Penn Treebank, confirming previous observations that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, particularly when the difference in length between the two conjuncts increases. However, this tendency only occurs when the governor (the head of the coordination) is on the left or absent. When the governor is on the right, the effect disappears.

This finding provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination, which single out one conjunct as the head, and in favor of symmetric structures, where all conjuncts are heads. The authors propose that the governor's position influences the preferred length of the conjuncts, supporting the idea that coordination structures are symmetric. The full argument is presented in the paper, and the authors invite discussion at the poster session.</sample>
    <sample id="217">This research, titled "Seen to Unseen: Exploring Compositional Generalization of Multi-Attribute Controllable Dialogue Generation," addresses the limitations of existing controllable dialogue generation methods that focus on single attributes. The authors, Weihao Zeng, Lulu Zhao, and Keqing He, propose a Disentangled Controllable Generation (DCG) model that learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses a disentanglement loss to disentangle different attribute combinations. The DCG model is based on the DialoGPT framework with a compositional prompt module, which includes two types of prompts: attribute-oriented and task-oriented. The authors also introduce a unified reference-free evaluation framework, MAE, for different granularities of attributes. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCG model and the MAE evaluation metric. The results show that the DCG model outperforms other baselines in attribute controllability and text equality, and that the MAE metric correlates well with human judgments. The authors conclude that their proposed method can disentangle attribute combinations and learn the relations between different attributes, enabling generalization from seen attributes to unseen combinations. This research contributes to the development of more controllable and generalizable dialogue generation models.</sample>

    <sample id="219">Researchers at Academia Sinica have developed a multistage pipeline for uncovering financial signals in financial reports. The project, led by Jia-Huei Ju, aims to automate the process of extracting useful information from annual reports, known as Form 10-K, which are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The team observed that 80% of tokens in company reports are similar and year-dependent, motivating the introduction of a highlighting task and a multi-stage pipeline.

The proposed pipeline consists of four stages: document segmentation, relation recognition, out-of-domain fine-tuning, and in-domain fine-tuning. The highlighting task involves comparing and contrasting the context between a target report and its previous year's report, with the goal of finding the rationale (words) of relations between the two. The team developed a domain-adaptive highlighting model that achieved the best performance on the FINAL dataset and preserved generalization capability. The model's performance was evaluated using two metrics: precision and correlation between prediction and annotations. The results show that the proposed method can benefit from mismatched pairs, which were not used during training. The project opens up opportunities for future research, including improving effectiveness and adding more features or techniques in information retrieval to enhance the application.</sample>

The authors highlight the limitations of training models on general-purpose domains, such as Wikipedia, when adapting to new domains, like biomedicine. They explore two types of data interventions: few-shot and zero-shot. Few-shot methods use a few examples from the target domain to prompt large language models for generating more examples, while zero-shot techniques control the interactions among question, answer, and context variables in a controlled manner. The authors also develop a compatibility measure to ascertain the nature of incompatibility between the target model and domain, categorizing shifts into "no shift," "concept shift," "covariate shift," and "full shift." By mapping target datasets onto a 2D grid, they estimate the type of dataset shift and find that different interventions are effective for different types of shifts. The results show that few-shot adaptations are effective for all target sets, while zero-shot adaptations are particularly useful for datasets with concept and covariate shift. Overall, this research contributes to the development of more effective domain adaptation strategies for open-domain QA.</sample>

    <sample id="227">Grounded language understanding, which involves mapping natural language expressions onto executable representations in specific environments, is a challenging task for current language models. Most language models are pre-trained on textual corpora without grounding, leading to a gap between pre-training and downstream applications. Existing research often relies on language models to directly generate plans via autoregressive decoding, but this approach can result in invalid or unexecutable plans. To address this issue, a novel framework called Pangu is proposed, which separates the generation of plans from the evaluation of their validity. In Pangu, a symbolic agent proposes candidate plans, and a language model scores and ranks them. This approach allows language models to focus on discrimination rather than generation, making it easier for them to excel. Experiments on knowledge-based question answering demonstrate that Pangu achieves outstanding performance across different settings, including fine-tuning and in-context learning, and exhibits strong sample efficiency. The results suggest that for grounded language understanding, generation may not be the best strategy, and discrimination might be a more effective approach.</sample>

    <sample id="229">This presentation discusses the importance of optimal phrasing in argumentative writing, particularly in stimulating a desired reaction from the audience. The authors, Gabriella Skitalinskaya and Henning Wachsmuth, focus on detecting improvable claims for argumentative writing support. They formalize two tasks: Suboptimal-Claim detection, which determines whether a claim needs revisions, and Claim Improvement Suggestion, which identifies quality issues to improve. The authors explore the challenges of working with revision-based data from collaborative online debate platforms, such as Kialo, and highlight four main challenges: Representativity and Reliability, Model Complexity and Architecture, Contextual Information, and Topical and User Bias. They present a detailed analysis of strategies tackling each challenge and a systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced tasks. The results show that revision-based data can be effectively employed for the given tasks, and modeling the distance between claimed versions is beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims. The impact of contextual information is dependent on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from. The authors conclude that their work provides a valuable contribution to the field of argumentative writing support and invites readers to refer to their paper for further details and findings.</sample>

    <sample id="233">This paper proposes a novel approach to simultaneous speech translation (SimulST), a process that translates spoken language into text in real-time. Current SimulST models have several limitations, including the need for specific architectures, long training procedures, and the maintenance of multiple models for different latency regimes. To address these issues, the authors suggest using existing offline speech translation (ST) models and leveraging the attention mechanism to handle latency. The proposed strategy, called EDAtt (Encoder-Decoder Attention), decides whether to emit a partial translation based on the attention points between the audio input and textual output. EDAtt emits a word if the attention is not concentrated on the last received speech frames, indicating that the information is stable. The authors compare EDAtt with popular strategies applied to offline models and state-of-the-art architectures specifically tailored for SimulST. The results show that EDAtt outperforms these strategies in terms of translation quality and latency, and is the fastest strategy when considering the actual elapsed time. The paper also releases open-source code, models, and simultaneous output to facilitate reproducibility. The proposed approach has the potential to improve real-time cross-language communication and is applicable to various languages and scenarios.</sample>

    <sample id="238">The MeetingBank dataset is a benchmark for meeting summarization, consisting of 1,366 City Council meetings and nearly 7,000 instances. The dataset addresses two major challenges: obtaining high-quality meeting summaries and trustworthy resources. To create MeetingBank, the authors used Speechmatics API to convert audio data to transcripts, extracted reference summaries from meeting minutes, and aligned timestamps to pair transcripts with summaries. The dataset provides statistics on meeting duration, number of tokens and speakers, and summarization instances for each city.

For data analysis, the authors measured the level of abstraction in meeting summaries using coverage and density scores. The results show that most summaries include verbatim points over abstraction, while Seattle and Boston have the highest density scores, indicating a high degree of editing. For model evaluation, the authors compared top-tier summarization systems, including extractive and abstractive models, and found that GPT-3 achieves the highest overall scores in human evaluation, despite poor performance in automatic metrics. The findings suggest that meeting summarization solutions should focus on capturing main discussion points and that new evaluation metrics should be developed to align with human preference. MeetingBank serves as a useful tool for researchers to design advanced meeting summarizers and provides insights into City Council decision-making processes.</sample>
    <sample id="241">This paper proposes a human-in-the-loop evaluation framework for early misinformation detection, addressing two key deficiencies in existing approaches: unrealistic evaluation and lack of human-centricity. The framework is designed to develop systems that go from raw social media data to actionable outputs, involving humans at various stages of the process. The system is composed of two main components: the first detects misleading claims by extracting claims from tweets, ranking them by trendiness, and providing them to humans for verification; the second verifies policy violations using a BERT-based stance classification model. The evaluation framework operationalizes early detection as the detection of unapproved treatments before their first appearance in debunking news articles. The efficacy of the policy violation verification portion of the workflow is evaluated using human ratings, with a 65% accuracy rate. Additionally, the system's human workload is analyzed, detecting 124.2 policy violations per human hour worked. The framework provides a more realistic and human-centric approach to misinformation detection, motivating the development of future human-in-the-loop systems. This work offers an out-of-industry look at the development and evaluation of misinformation detection systems, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.</sample>

    <sample id="245">This study presents a novel pipeline for identifying high-agreement workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for summarization tasks. The pipeline consists of two stages: qualification and endurance tasks. The qualification task assesses annotators' ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly, categorizing them into four types: gold, silver, bronze, and block. Only gold and silver workers can pass this task, resulting in 26 qualified MTurk workers. The endurance task tests annotators' capacity for handling heavy workloads, further filtering the workers to achieve high agreement in terms of inter-annotator agreement (IAA). The reference-based task evaluates general performance on the true annotation task, demonstrating that the pipeline workers achieve high agreement and outperform baseline MTurk workers. The study also compares the pipeline workers with CloudResearch MTurk workers and finds that they have similar quality but with lower task acceptance rates. The analysis of correctness across annotation sources reveals significant correlations between pipeline and CloudResearch workers, as well as between real GPT models and expert judgments. The pipeline is shown to be an effective method for achieving high-agreement annotations at a lower cost, serving as a best practice for large-scale annotation tasks.</sample>

The authors propose a new dataset, FactKG, which utilizes DBpedia as the knowledge graph and includes claims in both written and colloquial styles. The task consists of retrieving evidence from DBpedia and verifying claims using the evidence. Five types of reasoning are used: one-hop, conjunction, existence, multi-hop, and negation. The dataset includes 10,000 claims, with 50% of them in colloquial style, created using a colloquial style transfer model and presupposition templates. The authors construct two types of baselines: Claim Only, which uses only claims to verify, and GEAR, which uses graph evidence. The results show that all baselines outperform the majority class baseline, and the GEAR model using graph evidence outperforms all other baselines. This work provides a valuable resource for the fact verification community and demonstrates the potential of knowledge graphs in reliable fact verification. The proposed dataset and task can be applied to various applications, including dialogue systems and consistency checks between knowledge graphs and natural language.</sample>

    <sample id="252">A new approach called U-CREAT has been proposed to address the Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) task in the legal domain. This task involves retrieving relevant past precedents from a large pool of cases based on a given query document. The U-CREAT pipeline leverages unsupervised learning techniques and introduces an event-based approach to improve retrieval efficiency and generalization across different legal systems. The pipeline consists of an event extraction block that uses dependency parsing to extract subject-verb-object triplets, known as events, from query and candidate documents. An interaction matrix is then computed between the query and candidate events, which is used in different retrieval models to obtain a ranking order of the candidates.

Experiments were conducted using various models, including count-based, transformer-based, and event-based models. The results showed that event-based models perform significantly better than baseline methods, with the Event Filtered Documents model achieving the best performance. U-CREAT outperforms existing approaches, including a recent supervised approach, on the COLIEE'21 dataset, making it the current state-of-the-art method for the document retrieval task. The proposed approach opens up avenues for further exploration and development in the field of prior case retrieval.</sample>
    <sample id="253">This presentation introduces "DisorBERT," a double domain adaptation model designed to detect signs of mental disorders in social media. The researchers, from Mexico and Spain, aimed to develop a technology that can automatically analyze social media posts to support early warning systems for mental health disorders. The proposed approach involves adapting a base language model, BERT, to a specific domain using Reddit and mental health data, as well as incorporating a lexicon to guide the masking process. The guided masking technique allows the model to focus on important words during training.

The results show that DisorBERT outperforms baseline models, achieving a good balance between precision and recall. The model's ability to learn the social media language and specialize in the mental disorder domain is demonstrated through its performance on the eRisk dataset. The presentation also illustrates the model's behavior by analyzing its predictions on a sentence from Beck's Depression Inventory, showing that DisorBERT tends to generate words related to mental disorders. The study concludes that the combined effect of double domain adaptation and guided masking is effective in capturing signs of mental disorders in social media interactions. Future work aims to explore the application of different lexical resources and clinical data.</sample>
    <sample id="254">This research presents a novel framework for document-level distant relation extraction, addressing the noise problem in distantly supervised data. The proposed framework, "Uncertainty Guided Label Denoising for Document-level Distant Relation Extraction," leverages uncertainty estimation to determine the reliability of model predictions and mitigate the risk of noise induction by false-positive pseudo labels. 

A pre-denoising DocRE model is trained with both distantly supervised and human-annotated data to generate pseudo labels, which are then evaluated using instance-level uncertainty estimation. This method captures uncertainty scores for overlapping relations, allowing for the separation of false-positive pseudo labels from correct ones. 

A re-labeling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds and a multi-phase training strategy are designed to further boost performance. The framework is evaluated on public datasets, outperforming strong baselines in both datasets. The main contributions of this work include the uncertainty-guided label denoising framework, instance-level uncertainty estimation for overlapping relations, iterative re-label strategy for the long-tail problem, and significant performance improvements.

    <sample id="258">This study explores the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) as an alternative to human evaluation in natural language processing tasks. The researchers propose that LLMs can be instructed to evaluate the quality of text samples based on given attributes, such as grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance. To verify this idea, they conducted an experiment where LLMs were asked to rate stories generated by GPT-2 or written by humans. The results showed that two LLMs, Davinci and ChatGPT, demonstrated a clear preference for human-written text, similar to human evaluators. This suggests that LLMs can be used as a reliable alternative to human evaluation in certain tasks. The study also addresses potential limitations and factors that may affect the results of LLM evaluations, such as the wording of instructions and the sampling of responses. The findings of this study have significant implications for the natural language processing community, as they offer a more efficient and reproducible method for evaluating text quality. The study's results are presented in a paper that provides a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and costs of using LLM evaluation compared to human evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="259">This study proposes XSemPLR, a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and meaning representations. The task involves translating user queries in various languages into different meaning representations, such as SQL and Lambda Calculus. Existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models have limitations, including limited coverage of certain languages and meaning representations. To address this, the authors create a comprehensive dataset, XSemPLR, which includes 9 datasets, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 natural languages across 15 language families.

The study evaluates three types of multilingual language models: Encoder-PTR, Encoder-Decoder, and multilingual language models such as Codex and BLOOM. The results show that Encoder-Decoder models achieve the best performance across all nine datasets, and that pretraining on English natural language can significantly boost performance in few-shot settings. However, multilingual language models are found to be inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks. The study also investigates the "Curse of Multilinguality," where English performance drops in seven datasets. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of XSemPLR as a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing and provide insights into the limitations of current multilingual language models.</sample>

    <sample id="263">This work addresses the instability and bias issues in in-context learning, a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models. In-context learning's performance is known to be unstable due to various design choices, such as the choice and order of in-context examples, which introduce biases to the models' predictions. The authors propose a systematic investigation of the label bias problems of in-context learning, starting with a typology of label biases. They identify a new important type of bias, domain-label bias, which captures the effect of the task corpus on the model's predictions. The authors conduct experiments to confirm the existence of domain-label bias and demonstrate its impact on in-context learning's performance. To mitigate this bias and other types of biases, they propose a novel calibration method, domain-context calibration, which uses random in-domain words to estimate the model's bias and calibrate its predictions. The results show that domain-context calibration significantly improves the performance of in-context learning on a wide range of datasets and for larger models like GPT-3. The authors' work provides a comprehensive understanding of the label bias problems in in-context learning and proposes an effective solution to improve its performance.</sample>
    <sample id="264">This presentation introduces a novel task called Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation (TAVT), which aims to break through the constraints of multimodal domain shifts in audio-visual text generation tasks. The task involves aligning visual concepts across domains using a unified audio semantic space. The proposed framework consists of three components: an audio-visual meta-mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model generator, and counterfactual contrastive learning. The audio-visual meta-mapper network maps different visual concepts into a unified auditory semantic space, while the encoder and generator use a transformer-based architecture to generate text. The counterfactual contrastive learning module directly optimizes the visual-textual alignment scores using fine-grained supervision signals from counterfactual results. Experimental results on two benchmarks, MSVD and MSR-VTT, demonstrate that TAVT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on all metrics in both cross-datasets and cross-domain settings. The method also shows robustness to low-resource domains with limited labeled data. Ablation experiments further analyze the impact of audio features on performance. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the transferability and adaptability of audio-visual text generation models to new domains with limited data.</sample>

    <sample id="276">Ananya and Vignesh presented their work on "IndicMT Eval: A Dataset to Meta-Evaluate Machine Translation Metrics for Indian Languages". The study aims to fill the gap in evaluating translations in the other direction, particularly for Indian languages, which have unique characteristics such as grammar rules, vocabulary, and dialectic differences. The researchers collected 7,000 samples from five Indian languages (Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati) and obtained human annotations on these samples using bilingual expert annotators. The annotations captured a rich level of detail, including error types and severity. The study evaluated various machine translation metrics, including overlap-based and embedding-based metrics, and found that COMET-metric variants showed the highest overall correlations for all languages. However, the metrics exhibited a skewed range of scores, making it challenging to interpret them effectively. The researchers fine-tuned the best-performing metric, COMET, using their MQM dataset and observed improved correlations. They also evaluated the robustness of the fine-tuned metric on the ACES Translation Accuracy Challenge Sets, finding that it outperformed the COMET baseline. The study provides a publicly available dataset and contributes to the development of more effective machine translation metrics for Indian languages.</sample>

    <sample id="280">This paper proposes a novel attention-based correlation-aware multimodal fusion framework named MultiEMO for emotion recognition in conversations. The framework addresses three unsolved challenges in existing emotion regulation in conversations (ERC) methods: exploiting the complementarity of multimodal information, achieving satisfactory performances in minority emotion classes, and distinguishing between semantically similar emotions. 

MultiEMO consists of four key components: unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion, and emotion classification. The framework introduces three novel contributions: VisExtNet, a visual feature extractor that captures facial expressions without encoding redundant scene-related information; MultiAttn, a multimodal fusion network that integrates multimodal information through stacked bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers; and Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive Loss, a loss function that assigns higher importance to hard-to-classify minority classes and maximizes inter-class distances.

Experimental results on MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that MultiEMO achieves state-of-the-art performances, with significant improvements in minority and semantically similar emotions. The framework's superiority is also visualized through heatmaps of prone-to-misclassification utterances. However, MultiEMO has some limitations, including the inability to distinguish between speakers and irrelevant people in the scene, the requirement for a large batch size for the SWFC loss, and the performance gap between minority and majority classes.</sample>
    <sample id="281">This research explores the importance of context in machine translation, particularly for document-level translation. By analyzing transcripts of TED talks translated into 14 languages, the study measures how much context influences the translation of words and identifies patterns in context-dependent translations. The researchers extend a previous measure, CXMI, to Pointwise CXMI, which assesses context usage at the sentence or word level. They find that certain languages require context for translating dual pronouns, verb forms, and proper nouns, while others need context to convey formality and lexical cohesion.

To address the challenges of evaluating context-dependent translations, the researchers develop a benchmark, called MuDA, which automatically identifies context-dependent examples in a parallel corpus. They use MuDA to evaluate different machine translation models and find that context-aware models perform better than context-agnostic models for certain discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion. However, models without context perform comparably or even better for other phenomena, such as ellipsis, pronouns, and verb form. The study also compares commercial systems and finds that DeepL is generally more accurate than Google Translate for document-level translation. The research contributes to the development of more accurate document-level machine translation systems by highlighting the importance of context and providing a benchmark for evaluating context-dependent translations.</sample>
    <sample id="282">In the paper "StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Author-Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing," researchers present a novel approach to non-parallel text style transfer at the story level, focusing on the crucial aspect of discourse representations. The primary challenge lies in imitating an author's linguistic choices at the discourse level, which is often associated with specific writing topics. To address this, the researchers propose the StoryTrans generation model, which learns discourse representations from source texts and combines them with learnable style embeddings to generate texts in target styles. The model is trained using a two-stage approach: the first stage focuses on style transfer using self-reconstruction loss, disentanglement loss, sentence order loss, and style classifier loss, while the second stage aims to fill in style-specific content and remove mask tokens. The researchers evaluate StoryTrans using new datasets in Chinese and English, demonstrating its ability to transfer fairytales and everyday stories to typical author styles. The results show that StoryTrans outperforms strong baselines in terms of style control and content preservation, and style visualization indicates that the transferred text aligns with the golden text in the style feature space.</sample>

    <sample id="284">Title: FSUIE: A Novel Fuzzy Span Mechanism for Enhancing Universal Information Extraction

Abstract:

This paper presents FSUIE, a novel fuzzy span mechanism for enhancing universal information extraction (UIE) models. The current span-based UIE models rely heavily on precise boundary positions of annotated spans, which can be ambiguous and lead to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, FSUIE proposes a fuzzy span loss function that represents the target boundary as a continuous distribution of correct probabilities. This allows the model to learn a more robust and adaptive attention mechanism. Additionally, FSUIE introduces a fuzzy span attention (FSA) layer that dynamically adjusts the attention span and decays the attention distribution on the boundary, rather than truncating it. The proposed mechanism is evaluated on three main information extraction tasks: named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction. Experimental results show that FSUIE achieves significant performance improvements compared to UIE-base models, especially on small-scale data sizes. FSUIE also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and achieves new state-of-the-art results on several datasets. The ablation study shows that FSA and fuzzy span loss (FSL) have complementary effects, leading to greater enhancement in information extraction capability. Overall, FSUIE presents a novel and effective approach to UIE, with promising applications in various natural language processing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="285">A study titled "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation Framework" proposes a novel approach to address factual errors in dialogue summarization. Current factual error correction (FEC) models are evaluated using factuality metrics, such as FactCC and DAE, which are deemed inadequate due to their vagueness and unreliability. The study argues that FEC models can ignore the original summary's content and generate a new, factually correct summary without correcting errors. To address this issue, the authors introduce manually annotated reference corrections, which provide valuable data for training FEC models and enable a more comprehensive evaluation of their performance. A new taxonomy of factual errors is proposed, categorizing errors into content-based and form-based types. An evaluation framework is built on the basis of ERRANT, an evaluation metric for grammar error correction, and is used to explore factors influencing FEC model performance. The study finds that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yields the best results, and that introducing human-corrected summaries during training can improve performance. Current FEC models struggle to correct certain types of errors, highlighting the need for more effective evaluation methods and improved model performance.</sample>

    <sample id="296">This study presents a collaborative effort between the University of Turin and Amazon Alexa to develop a more nuanced approach to natural language processing, specifically in the detection of irony. The researchers created the English Perspectivist Irony Corpus (EPIC), a dataset of 300 short conversations from social media, Reddit, and Twitter, annotated by 74 individuals from diverse backgrounds and English language varieties. The study investigates the limitations of traditional supervised machine learning approaches, which rely on a single "ground truth" and assumes that annotators converge towards it. Instead, the researchers aim to develop perspective-aware models that capture the variability in human perception of irony.

The study finds that annotators from different age groups, nationalities, and language varieties exhibit distinct patterns of agreement and disagreement in their annotations. The researchers develop perspective-aware models that outperform traditional gold standard aggregated models in terms of confidence, but not necessarily in raw performance. Further analysis reveals that annotators from adjacent generations and those from different geographical regions tend to disagree more in their perception of irony. These findings highlight the importance of considering the diversity of human perspectives in natural language processing and the need for more nuanced models that can capture these differences.</sample>
    <sample id="297">This research project, "From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns," aims to understand and mitigate the use of coded rhetoric in language, specifically dogwhistles, which convey a hidden message to an in-group while maintaining plausible deniability. The project develops a typology and glossary of over 340 terms and symbols, including racist, transphobic, and anti-Semitic dogwhistles, with rich contextual information. A case study of historical U.S. political speeches reveals a pattern of increased dogwhistle use in speeches containing racial dogwhistles, particularly among conservative politicians since the Civil Rights era.

The researchers also evaluate dogwhistle recognition in language models, specifically GPT-3, through experiments that demonstrate its ability to surface dogwhistles, particularly those in the formal register. However, the model's performance varies significantly, with poorer results for informal dogwhistles and transphobic dogwhistles. Additionally, the study shows that dogwhistles can evade content moderation by reducing toxicity detection scores when standard group labels or slurs are replaced with dogwhistles. The project's findings highlight the importance of understanding dogwhistles in NLP and linguistics and their potential to enable hateful rhetoric while evading content moderation online.</sample>

    <sample id="299">Recent advancements in Natural Language Inference (NLI) models have achieved state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks. However, these models often rely on shortcuts, or spurious correlations, introduced during dataset creation, leading to poor out-of-distribution performance. Existing shortcut mitigation methods assume access to an auxiliary model designed to exploit shortcuts, which is not always feasible. To address this limitation, a new training method is proposed, which utilizes a minimax training objective between a learner and an auxiliary model. The learner aims to minimize the NLI task loss, while the auxiliary model maximizes the learner's loss by generating example weights that encourage the learner to focus on under-represented, "hard" examples that counteract shortcuts. This approach does not assume domain- or dataset-specific knowledge and relies on the learner's own training dynamics. The proposed method is evaluated on three commonly used NLI datasets and their corresponding out-of-distribution adversarial test sets, demonstrating improved out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy. The study also explores the effect of pre-training the learner, the size of the auxiliary model, and the transferability of performance improvements to larger models and out-of-domain test sets.</sample>
    <sample id="300">Interactive dictation is a novel task that enables users to dictate and edit documents using natural and intuitive voice commands. Unlike traditional speech-to-text systems, interactive dictation allows users to seamlessly interleave dictation and editing, without requiring trigger words or commands. This task is characterized by flexible interleaving of dictation and editing, and the use of open-ended natural language utterances to specify edits. A new dataset was collected using a designed interface, where users can dictate and edit text while the system transcribes and executes their commands in real-time. A baseline system was built to perform the four steps of the interactive dictation task: ASR recognition, segmentation, command extraction and normalization, and execution. The system was evaluated using exact match of the predicted end-state against the goal end-state, and the results showed a trade-off between runtime and accuracy. The study found that GPT-3 models were more accurate but slower, while T5 models were more efficient with minimal impact on accuracy. The authors released code to facilitate future work on this task, and highlighted the need for further progress in this area.</sample>

    <sample id="305">In the work "Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning," researchers Dawei, Xiaoyu Shen, Marius Mosbach, Andreas Stephan, and Dietrich Klakow investigate the limitations of weakly supervised learning (WSL) methods. WSL relies on weak labeling sources, such as simple heuristic rules or low-quality crowdsourcing, which are cheaper but noisier than human annotations. Recent WSL approaches claim to achieve high performance on clean test sets, but this is often due to the availability of an additional clean validation set for model selection. The researchers address three research questions: whether clean validation data is necessary for WSL, how many clean samples are required, and how to utilize them. Their findings indicate that recent WSL methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly, and increasing the number of clean validation samples improves performance. However, direct fine-tuning on clean data can achieve better performance than WSL approaches, and the performance gain claimed by previous WSL methods can be easily achieved by allowing continuous fine-tuning on clean samples. The researchers conclude that WSL approaches are heavily overestimated and provide recommendations for future work, including reporting model selection criteria and comparing WSL with few-shot learning baselines.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Researchers Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim investigate the ability of pre-trained language models to track entities and their state changes in a discourse. They argue that this ability is crucial for understanding longer discourses, but there has been a lack of systematic investigations into the entity state tracking abilities of large language models. To address this, they designed a task to evaluate entity tracking abilities, involving boxes and objects with state-changing operations. The task was set up to prevent models from using heuristics, such as fine-tuning or in-context demonstrations, which could give away the entity states. The researchers tested the task with Flan-T5 and GPT-3 and -3.5 models using 2-shot in-context learning. The results showed that most models simply repeated the initial state, but text-davinci-003 exhibited non-trivial tracking behavior. The researchers found that pre-training on code is responsible for making entity tracking capacity surface in pre-trained language models. They also found that smaller models can learn to perform entity tracking with direct fine-tuning, but randomly initialized models cannot. The study highlights the importance of pre-training in developing entity tracking abilities in language models.</sample>

    <sample id="308">This presentation discusses the concept of positionality in NLP, where datasets and models reflect the perspectives of their creators and annotators. The researchers propose the NLPositionality framework to study and characterise the design biases of datasets and models. Through a study involving over 16,000 annotations from 1000 annotators from 87 countries, the researchers find that NLP datasets and models are most aligned with English-speaking countries and individuals with a college education. However, this alignment comes at the expense of other populations, including non-binary people. The study highlights the importance of considering positionality in NLP research and provides recommendations for addressing these biases. The researchers suggest that NLP researchers should keep a record of design choices, conduct research with a perspectivist lens, and build specialised datasets and models within specific communities. The study's findings and recommendations aim to promote more inclusive NLP practices that better serve diverse populations. The researchers' work has implications for the development of more equitable and representative NLP technologies.</sample>

    <sample id="317">Researchers from Fudan University have proposed a novel approach to information extraction tasks, titled CodeIE, which leverages large code generation models to improve performance. The traditional text-to-text approach used in previous models, such as T5 and GPT-3, has limitations due to the mismatch between the structured output and the plain text input. To address this issue, CodeIE transforms the text-to-structured information extraction task into a structure-to-structure code generation task, utilizing code large language models like Codex. The researchers designed prompts for named entity recognition and relation extraction tasks, utilizing code format and few-shot in-context demonstrations. The proposed approach was evaluated on various recognition and relation extraction datasets, comparing the performance of traditional text-style prompts and code-style prompts. The results showed that CodeIE significantly outperformed the traditional baseline models, particularly in terms of recall, and demonstrated better alignment with the information extraction task itself. The study also highlighted the superiority of the Codex model over GPT-3 in information extraction tasks, regardless of prompt formats. The CodeIE approach provides a new perspective on information extraction and has the potential to inspire further research in this area.</sample>

    <sample id="322">This presentation at ACL 23 explores the question of what text classifiers learn about morality. Human morality is complex and subjective, and current approaches to understanding morality in text often treat it as a singular scale between immoral and moral. However, the Moral Foundation Theory suggests that morality is composed of five different foundations, prioritized differently by individuals, which affects their moral judgments. 

To address this complexity, the authors apply explainable AI techniques to language models trained to understand morality in text, focusing on the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus, a dataset of 35,000 tweets across seven domains. They investigate whether language models can recognize fine-grained differences in morality expressed across domains. 

Their experiments reveal that language models can recognize differences in morality, such as the association of subversion with words like "overthrow" in the "All Lives Matter" domain versus the encouragement of subversion in the "Black Lives Matter" domain. However, the authors warn that using a single model across multiple domains can lead to misunderstandings of morality, highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches to understanding morality in text. This research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of what language models learn about morality and the potential risks of relying on a single model for complex moral judgments.</sample>
    <sample id="323">This paper proposes a novel approach, Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and Knowledge Representation Learning (DHLK), to tackle the challenging task of Commonsense QA. The existing methods combine language models and knowledge bases, but they often introduce noisy entities and limited interaction between modalities. DHLK addresses these issues by building a heterogeneous knowledge graph (HKG) based on multiple knowledge bases, optimized through a two-stage pruning strategy and knowledge representation learning. The HKG is then encoded and fused with the language model using RoBERTa and Mask Self-Attention. To refine the HKG, entities with weaker relevance to the QA context are dynamically removed based on attention weights. The entity and relation embeddings are optimized using TransE, and the subgraph is modeled using Relation Mask Self-Attention (RMSA). The HKG path information is incorporated into the QA context, and the final answer prediction is made by inputting the HKG graph, paths, and QA context into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA demonstrate the effectiveness of DHLK, achieving good results compared to other language model and HKG methods.</sample>

The proposed ManagerTower architecture introduces managers in each cross-modal layer to adaptively aggregate insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels, enabling the exploitation of various levels of unimodal semantic knowledge. This approach contrasts with existing methods, such as BridgeTower, which suffer from limitations in utilizing unimodal layer representations and scalability. ManagerTower demonstrates superior performance on various downstream tasks, achieving a 39.15% accuracy on the Wikivideo test standard, outperforming other models, including those trained with more data or parameters. The research also visualizes the average aggregation weights of textual and visual managers in each cross-modal layer, revealing distinct trends that support the effectiveness of adaptive managers in exploiting different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge. The ManagerTower architecture is designed to be flexible and can accommodate various encoders, making it a promising approach for vision-language representation learning.

    <sample id="329">This work focuses on zero-shot video sentence localization, a task that involves finding the most relevant segments of a video based on a given natural language query. The task has broad applications in video retrieval, summarization, and other fields, but existing methods require a large number of manual annotations for training, which is costly and inefficient. To address this issue, the authors propose a noise-resistant structured pseudo-label generation method that enables training video sentence localization models without manual annotations. The proposed method generates free-form pseudo-queries using a pre-trained image caption model and pseudo-events based on the event temporal structure. To reduce the influence of label noise, the authors use sample re-weighting and label refinement techniques. The method is evaluated on two datasets, ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA, and outperforms existing zero-shot methods on most metrics. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in zero-shot video sentence localization. The code for the proposed method is made available for further research and development. The work has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of video sentence localization tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="333">This paper proposes a novel training framework, INK, to enhance the generalization and performance of neural machine translation (NMT) models. The framework injects k-nearest neighbor (kNN) knowledge into the NMT model to smooth the representation space and address the issue of sparse token distribution. The INK training loop consists of two steps: extracting kNN knowledge from a datastore to guide an adapter to adjust the representation, and updating the representation to refresh the datastore asynchronously. The adapter is trained with a combined learning objective, allowing for three types of representation alignment using KL-divergence. Experimental results on the WMT'19 German-English news translation task show that the INK system outperforms the state-of-the-art kNN-MT system, achieving an average gain of 1.99 COMET score and 1.0 BLEU score. The INK system also achieves better translation performance with less memory space and faster inference speed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the INK framework in refining the representation space of NMT models, leading to improved translation performance. The proposed framework provides a novel approach to addressing the limitations of NMT models and has the potential to be applied to other machine translation tasks.</sample>

The method leverages word formation and association to infer the meaning of OOV words, drawing inspiration from human study habits. A Word Relationship Graph is introduced to imitate lexical rules of word formation and association, where each word or wordpiece acts as a node, and its corresponding word embedding serves as the node attribution. To address the issue of assigning node attributes to OOV nodes, a self-attention network is utilized. The proposed model applies two levels of Graph Attention Network to extract the most important information and reduce the impact of noise neighbor nodes. A readout block layer is incorporated to capture the whole graph information and summarize the word formation. Contrastive learning is applied in the loss function to mimic the vector space of the background embedding model. Through extensive experiments, the model has demonstrated superior performance to baselines in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, proving the effectiveness of learning OOV words by word formation. The model can be applied to other languages, but its performance largely depends on the rationality of word decomposition.</sample>
    <sample id="338">Researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research collaborated to address the challenge of evaluating the quality of human-annotated explanations. Traditional metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE focus on word similarity, while the simulatability score measures the performance change when explanations are presented or absent. However, these metrics neglect task differences and the utility of explanations during fine-tuning and inference stages. 

The study proposes a unified structure for various tasks, including a template-based format that converts tasks into a unified multiple-choice task. An experiment was conducted to analyze the utility of explanations, with results showing that fine-tuning with infusion actually teaches the model to rely on the explanation part of the input to predict. 

A novel evaluation metric called TREU was proposed, which extends the simulatability score to evaluate the helpfulness of explanations at fine-tuning. The TREU score was evaluated on five large-scale datasets with two models, T5 and BART, and consistently ranked dataset qualities better than the simulatability score. The study demonstrates that the helpfulness of human explanations to models heavily depends on the task and explanation format. The findings lay the foundation for high-quality human collaboration in annotation jobs and recommend researchers perform similar quality checks in the future.</sample>

    <sample id="340">This research presents ParaAMR, a large-scale syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset constructed through Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) back-translation. Existing human-annotated paraphrase datasets are limited in scale, while automatically generated datasets lack syntactic diversity. The proposed method leverages AMR graphs to generate paraphrases by modifying the focus node, edge labels, and edge relationships. This approach preserves semantic similarity while increasing syntactic diversity. The resulting ParaAMR dataset contains approximately 15 million source sentences with 6.9 paraphrases per source sentence. Compared to other datasets, ParaAMR exhibits higher syntactic diversity scores while maintaining similar semantic similarity scores. The authors demonstrate the benefits of ParaAMR in various NLP applications, including learning sentence embeddings, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and data augmentation for few-shot learning. In these tasks, ParaAMR outperforms existing paraphrase datasets. The availability of ParaAMR is announced, providing a valuable resource for the NLP community. Overall, this work addresses the limitations of existing paraphrase datasets and showcases the potential of ParaAMR in advancing NLP applications.</sample>

    <sample id="342">This paper presents LiveChat, a large-scale personalized dialogue dataset automatically constructed from live streaming videos on Chinese TikTok, Douyin. The dataset addresses the limitations of existing open-domain dialogue datasets, which are mainly text-sourced and lack personalized dialogue scenarios. LiveChat is constructed through a three-step process: audio extraction, dialogue construction, and persona information collection. The persona extraction method involves both manual labeling and rule-based extraction using trained classifiers. Experiments on two benchmark tasks, Response Modeling and Addressee Recognition, demonstrate the effectiveness of LiveChat in personalized dialogue generation. The results show that persona information and longer average sessions are beneficial for response modeling, while single-stream BERT outperforms double-stream BERT in Addressee Recognition. Furthermore, the performance of pre-trained dialogue models on LiveChat reveals the distinctiveness of the dataset, with BART showing better performance than other models. In-context learning experiments demonstrate the influence of demonstrations on the performance of large language models. The study contributes to the development of personalized dialogue applications and provides a valuable resource for research in this area.</sample>

    <sample id="345">This paper proposes a novel neural sequence-to-sequence model that achieves compositional generalization without relying on trees. The model directly models the correspondences between input and output fragments, allowing it to generalize to deeper recursion. The approach consists of two steps: first, input tokens are tagged with unordered multisets of output tokens; second, a permutation model predicts the order of these tokens. The permutation model is designed to be flexible and expressive, with a novel method that does not impose hard constraints on possible permutations. Experimental results on the COGS benchmark show that the model outperforms other treeless models by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion. However, some types of structural generalization remain challenging. The paper addresses technical challenges such as inducing alignment between input and output, and approximating the highest-scoring permutation using a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation. This approach allows for backpropagation through the solution and learning of linguistically more plausible permutations. The proposed model and methods provide a new perspective on compositional generalization and have the potential to improve semantic parsing and other natural language processing tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="348">This research, "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models," aims to overcome the limitations of existing methods for detecting social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs). The authors, Myra, Esin Durmus, and Dan Jurafsky, utilize the ability of instruction-tuned LLMs to respond to natural language prompts to generate personas that reflect various demographics. They then apply the "Marked Words" method to identify words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, revealing specific stereotypes and patterns without relying on pre-constructed lexicons.

The study reveals that generated personas contain more stereotypes than human-written ones, but these stereotypes are often positive or non-negative. However, upon closer analysis, the authors find that these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns, such as essentializing narratives and tropes that contribute to discrimination and othering. The study highlights the importance of using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms, addressing positive stereotypes, and increasing transparency about bias mitigation methods. The authors conclude with three recommendations for model owners: to address positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, use an intersectional lens, and provide increased transparency about bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="350">This paper examines the meaning of superhuman performance in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and challenges the notion that current models have surpassed human capabilities. The authors analyze two popular benchmarks, SuperGLUE and SQuAD, and find that the comparison between humans and systems is often unfair due to various biases and errors. Specifically, humans are evaluated on a small subset of the test set, while systems are evaluated on the full set. Additionally, errors in the ground-truth answers and lack of transparency in the annotator pool make the comparison unreliable. The authors argue that the current practice of using vague human baselines and low pay rates for annotators can lead to low-quality human performance. They also highlight the importance of considering the annotator pool's cultural background and hiring process when constructing benchmarks. The paper concludes that claims of superhuman performance are not yet scientifically meaningful and provides recommendations for constructing more reliable benchmarks. The authors emphasize the need for a more nuanced understanding of NLU and a more rigorous evaluation of human and system performance.</sample>
    <sample id="351">This paper, "Do CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023?", investigates the generalization of named entity recognition (NER) models developed over 20 years ago using the CoNLL-2003 dataset. To address this, the authors created the CoNLL++ dataset by annotating Reuters news from 2020 using the same guidelines as CoNLL-2003. They fine-tuned 20 models on CoNLL-2003 and evaluated their performance on both the original CoNLL-03 test set and the CoNLL++ dataset. The results show that three key factors contribute to good generalization: 1) a suitable model architecture, 2) a larger model size, and 3) more fine-tuning examples. The authors also explored two potential causes of performance drop: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. Their findings suggest that temporal drift is the main cause of performance degradation, as retraining models with more recent data leads to a larger performance gap. In contrast, adaptive overfitting is not observed. The study concludes that CoNLL-2003 taggers can still work well in 2023, but with the need for better model architectures, larger model sizes, and more fine-tuning examples. The authors hope their research will encourage further investigation into improving model generalization.</sample>

    <sample id="353">This paper proposes an innovative approach to address the challenge of input underspecification in code generation and program synthesis. The authors introduce interactivity into code generation by asking clarification questions (CQs) to gather more specifications and alleviate the problem of underspecification. They focus on clarifying operation-level specifications and propose a method to create a synthetic dataset, CodeClarQA, with clarifications on key operations. The dataset is created by identifying key operations and their corresponding documentation from the code, representing them in a latent space, and computing similarity scores between the natural language description (NLD) and the operation documentation. The authors also propose a pipeline of code generation by asking CQs, consisting of a Clarification Need Predictor, a Question Selector, and a Code Generator. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively identifies missing key operations and that clarifications help code generation. The authors also analyze the errors and common challenges, providing insights for future improvements. The paper concludes that clarified key operations are a crucial factor in better generated code, and the proposed pipeline has the potential to improve code generation performance.</sample>

    <sample id="361">Armineh Nourbakhsh, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and research director at JP Morgan AI Research, presents "CounterComp," a novel approach to improving compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning in question answering tasks. The method focuses on using counterfactual scenarios to train models to attend to relevant tokens in the input and generate accurate arithmetic operations in the output. Current state-of-the-art neural models struggle with this task, particularly when the output involves more than two steps, due to memorization of spurious patterns.

To address this challenge, CounterComp mines positive and negative examples from the training set by intervening in the question and measuring the change in output. An auxiliary metric learning loss is added to the training procedure, with a dynamic margin that adjusts to the extent of change in the questions. Experiments show that incorporating this loss improves performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples, particularly when the number of reasoning steps exceeds two. The approach also enables models to attend to more meaningful tokens during training, which relate to operational terms in the output. By leveraging counterfactual scenarios, CounterComp offers a promising solution to the limitations of current neural models in multi-step quantitative reasoning tasks.</sample>
