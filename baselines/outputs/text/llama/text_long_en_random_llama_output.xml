    <sample id="2">Tu Yi from Ant Group presented a paper on document understanding, focusing on visually-rich document understanding (VRDU). The team aimed to enhance text-layout interactions and layout representations using a novel pre-trained model called LayoutMask. 

LayoutMask differs from previous studies in three aspects: choice of 1D position, masking strategy, and pre-training objectives. It uses in-segment token orders (local 1D position) instead of global 1D position, and infers global reading order by jointly using 1D position, 2D position, and semantic information. 

To promote text-layout interactions, LayoutMask equips the Masked Language Modeling task with two novel masking strategies: Whole Word Masking and Layout-Aware Masking. The model also includes a new pre-training objective, Masked Position Modeling, which involves recovering randomly masked 2D positions.

Experiments showed that using local 1D position (Local-1D) outperforms global 1D position (Global-1D) on the FUNSD and SROIE datasets, except for the CORD dataset where the performance gap mainly comes from the entity "Total". The results suggest that using Local-1D is more adaptive to cases with vertical and horizontal layouts and multiple misleading numbers.</sample>

    <sample id="6">Jiaan presented a joint work with colleagues on "Towards Unifying Multi-Lingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization". They unified multilingual and cross-lingual summarization into a more general setting called many-to-many summarization. This aims to create a single model that can process documents in any source language and generate summaries in any target language. Preliminary studies showed that many-to-many summarization helps transfer task knowledge across languages better than previous methods. The team proposed PISCES, a pre-trained many-to-many summarization model that learns language modeling, cross-lingual ability, and summarization through a three-stage pre-training process. 

To compare different summarization methods, the team conducted experiments on the WikiLingua dataset using four models: mBART ONE, mBART U-CLS, mBART MLS, and mBART Many-to-Many Summarization. Results showed that the many-to-many summarization model outperformed other methods in transferring task knowledge across languages. PISCES, the proposed model, outperformed baselines mBART-50 and mT5 in experimental results. Ablation studies and human studies verified the effectiveness of each training stage and the superiority of PISCES. The full details of the work can be found in their paper.</sample>

3. **Background knowledge retrieval**: Enhance the model's ability to retrieve relevant background knowledge, potentially using more advanced search engines or knowledge graphs.
4. **Indirect reference resolution**: Improve the model's ability to resolve indirect references, possibly using techniques like entity coreference resolution or natural language inference.
5. **Multi-task learning**: Train models on multiple related tasks, such as entity selection and indirect reference resolution, to improve overall performance.</sample>
    <sample id="11">Research scientist Jack Hessel from AI2 presented a study on "Do Androids Laugh at Electric Sheep? Humor “Understanding” Benchmarks from The New Yorker Caption Contest." The study aimed to evaluate the humor understanding capacity of large language models. 

The researchers used The New Yorker Caption Contest data, which includes cartoons with submitted captions. They operationalized the data into three tasks: matching, quality ranking, and explanation generation. The matching task involves identifying the correct caption from five options, while the quality ranking task requires ranking two captions based on their quality. The explanation generation task asks models to explain why a joke is funny.

The study found that language models struggle to understand humor. The best model, CLIP fine-tuned on the corpus, achieved 62% accuracy on the matching task, while humans achieved 94%. Even with additional annotation, GPT-4 performed poorly on the matching and quality ranking tasks. The study also found that human explanations were preferred to GPT-4 explanations in over two-thirds of cases. The researchers released their dataset and models for further evaluation and improvement.</sample>

    <sample id="13">Daniel Rotem presented his work, "Finding the SWEET Spot: Analysis and Improvement of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings", which focuses on reducing the inference time of large language models. The research compares two adaptive inference methods: Multi Model and Early Exit. Multi Model uses multiple models, each with a classifier at the end, while Early Exit uses multiple classifiers after intermediate transformer layers. 

The study highlights the pros and cons of each method. Multi Model is more versatile but suffers from overhead and storage costs. Early Exit is memory-efficient but shares model parameters, leading to conflicting gradients. This phenomenon occurs when each classifier updates model weights, interfering with each other's performance. 

To test this hypothesis, the researchers compared individual Early Exit models with separate Multi Model classifiers. The results showed that Multi Model classifiers outperformed Early Exit by an average of 2.3%. The researchers then introduced SWEET (Separating Weights in Early Exit Transformers), a novel fine-tuning method that avoids conflicting gradients by training each layer to receive updates only from the following classifier. The results of SWEET showed improved performance compared to Early Exit, closing the gap with Multi Model. The study concludes by highlighting the existence of conflicting gradients in Early Exit training and introducing the SWEET method, which motivates future research and fine-tuning algorithms tailored to the Early Exit architecture.</sample>

    <sample id="17">Shengqiong Wu, a PhD student at NUS, presented a work on multimodal relation extraction. The task aims to determine semantic relations between entities in text, but in real-world scenarios like social media, data comes in various forms and modalities. To address this, multimodal relation extraction combines text and visual sources. However, issues arise from internal-information over-utilization and external-information under-exploitation. 

To address these problems, the proposed method employs a Graph Information Bottleneck principle-guided feature refinement and incorporates multimodal topic information. The framework consists of five parts: text and image representation, merging the visual and textual scene graphs into a unified backbone cross-modal graph, fine-grained filtering and edge adjustment, leveraging the graph information bottleneck for optimization, and enriching compressed features with multimodal topic features. 

Experiments on a widely used MRE dataset show that the proposed method outperforms text-based and multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of information screening and compensating. The method's effectiveness is evaluated by grouping instances by text region relevance scores, demonstrating the roles of internal-information screening and external-information exploiting under different circumstances. The overall system achieves significant improvements over existing best models on benchmarks.</sample>

    <sample id="19">The presentation focuses on efficient open-domain question answering systems. The mainstream framework is a two-stage model, consisting of retrieval and reader stages. However, this framework faces challenges such as large Wikipedia corpus size, index file size, and computational complexity. To address these issues, the presentation proposes several efficient tactics, including:

1. Fast evidence research: using approximate nearest neighbor search instead of brute search.
2. Fast reading: using skip reading techniques like adaptive computation.
3. Reduced index size: using document filtering, embedding dimension completion, or product quantization.
4. Reduced model size: using lightweight models, parameter sharing, or designing fewer models.

The presentation also compares existing open-domain question answering models from the data aspect, highlighting the trade-offs between speed, memory, and performance. Based on this analysis, the presentation provides conclusions and insights for different scenarios, including:

- Reducing index size or model size for resource-constrained devices.
- Pursuing real-time feedback using retrieval-only systems.
- Pursuing trade-offs using retrieval and reader systems.

The presentation concludes with two future works: deploying open-domain question answering systems on low-power devices and considering more evaluation metrics.</sample>

    <sample id="23">Researchers, including Dan Garrette, investigated the issue of text rendering in image models. They found that models like Imagen struggle with representing text, especially for simple inputs. By analyzing the T5 text encoder, they discovered that it has a low accuracy rate for spelling, even for larger models. In contrast, the PaLM model performs better but is impractical due to its size and training requirements.

The researchers also explored the ByT5 model, which uses individual bytes as input, allowing it to learn to copy characters from the input to the output. ByT5 achieves high spelling accuracy across all scales. They found that the T5 model struggles more with frequent words, which are often represented by a single vocabulary item or a few subwords.

To improve text rendering models, the researchers augmented the Imagen model with an additional text representation from the ByT5 small model. This addition significantly improved the model's spelling ability, increasing its parameter count by only 5%. The resulting model can render text more accurately, but the diffusion model can still introduce errors. The study introduces two new benchmarks, WikiSpell and DrawText, and proposes a strategy for improving model spelling ability by concatenating a character-aware model.</sample>

    <sample id="30">Researchers from AI2 and USC introduced their paper, "LLM-Blender", a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework for large language models. The framework, named LLM-Blender, combines pairwise ranking and generative fusion to select and generate better output than using a single model for all inputs. The proposed two-stage framework consists of a PairRanker module that compares candidates using pairwise comparisons and a sequence-to-sequence model for generated fusion.

The researchers created a new dataset, MixInstruct, consisting of existing instruction datasets and candidates from 11 open-source large language models. They used automatic metrics such as BERTScore, BLUERT, and BARTScore, as well as human evaluation by ChatGPT, to compare the performance of LLM-Blender with top models such as Open Assistant and Vicuna.

The results showed that LLM-Blender outperformed the top models in 68% and 76% of examples, respectively, and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The researchers also released a unified codebase for evaluation and future research. The LLM-Blender framework is considered a promising approach for ensemble learning, and its simplicity and effectiveness make it a valuable contribution to the field of large language models.</sample>

    <sample id="34">Marcos Treviso presented a work called "CREST: A Joint Framework for Rationalization and Counterfactual Text Generation." CREST combines selective rationalization and counterfactual generation to produce valid and fluent counterfactuals. The framework consists of two components: a rationalizer that generates a rationale for the input, and a counterfactual generator that produces a counterfactual example by masking the original input and filling in the masked response with new tokens.

To evaluate CREST, human evaluation experiments were conducted on 100 examples from IMDB and SNLI. Results showed that CREST counterfactuals were more valid and natural than those generated by MiCE, but less valid and natural than manual counterfactuals. However, CREST outperformed MiCE in terms of validity and naturalness.

CREST was also used for data augmentation and proposed an alternative method, CREST-Rationalization, which performs rationalization with both factual and counterfactual examples. Experiments showed that CREST-Rationalization achieved the top result on IMDB and outperformed other methods on contrastive and out-of-domain datasets. Finally, CREST-Rationalization produced more plausible rationales and higher counterfactual simulability than other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The main points of the English content are as follows:

The speaker discusses a joint work on "Learning Language-Specific Layers for Multilingual Machine Translation" with the goal of increasing the capacity per language in multilingual machine translation while keeping inference costs constant. 

Their solution is Language-Specific Layers (LSLs), where each language has a regular transformer layer that can be selected at inference time to reduce inference costs. 

They focused on the encoder and used a model to learn the placement of LSLs, with three weights (shared, source, and target) for each encoder layer. 

The approach that performed best in their experiments was to select the component based on the largest weight. 

Their results show that their learned architecture has significant improvements over baseline models and language adapters, with large improvements for low-resource languages. 

The approach is also faster at inference time, with significant improvements for 84 out of 90 translation directions. 

The speaker concludes by inviting the audience to check out the full paper or attend their poster session for more information.</sample>

    <sample id="41">Researchers at EPFL University and Sony Group Corporation propose a Persona-grounded Commonsense Knowledge Graph, PeaCoK, to represent real-world personas and their complex interconnections. PeaCoK contains 3,800 personas, 40,000 attributes, and 100,000 personal inferences. It was built in three steps: selecting personas from existing commonsense graphs, inducing attributes from knowledge graphs and pre-trained language models, and crowdsourcing annotations using a joint human-AI majority voting scheme.

PeaCoK is used to train a BART-based common knowledge generator, which achieves better results compared to large-scale pre-trained language models. The graph is also used to improve downstream narrative modeling, specifically persona-grounded dialogue generation. Human evaluation shows that PeaCoK augmented models achieve better dialogue generation on aspects such as fluency, consistency, engagement, and persona expression.

The results highlight the importance of learning interconnected world persona knowledge in narratives. PeaCoK's persona-centric commonsense knowledge yields a more positive impact compared to general social commonsense knowledge. The study also finds that the winning rates of PeaCoK augmented models increase as the number of shared common attributes between two speakers becomes larger, indicating that more connections between speakers lead to more consistent and engaging conversations.</sample>

    <sample id="50">Regina Stodden presented DEPLAIN, a new corpus for German text identification on the document and sentence level. The corpus is designed to improve text comprehension for specific target groups, such as people with reading problems or non-native speakers. DEPLAIN is split into two subcorpora: DEPLAIN-apa (news texts with 13,000 parallel sentence pairs) and DEPLAIN-web (various domains with 30,450 sentence pairs). The corpus has a high variety of simplification transformations and was analyzed to show differences in simplification levels between domains.

Omar then discussed the use cases for DEPLAIN. The first use case is evaluating automatic alignment methods, where DEPLAIN's manually aligned sentences serve as a gold standard to evaluate proposed methods. The best method found was MASSalign. The second use case is automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models. Two models were fine-tuned to produce document-level and sentence-level simplifications, respectively. The results showed that basic fine-tuning could produce better scores than baseline scores, proposing these results as a benchmark for future automatic text simplification problems.</sample>

    <sample id="54">Vasudha, a Computer Science PhD candidate at Stony Brook University, presented their work on "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare-Class Challenge" accepted into ACL 2023. Cognitive dissonance refers to inconsistent beliefs or actions, such as a person knowing cigarettes are harmful but smoking anyway. This phenomenon is common in daily life but rare in language. Studying dissonance can help understand disagreement, track trends, and mental health, as well as extremism and polarization. 

To create a cognitive dissonance resource, Vasudha's team conducted large-scale annotation and used a dissonance-first approach. However, due to the rarity of dissonance, their initial classifier performed poorly. To alleviate this, they experimented with transfer learning and active learning to collect more dissonant samples efficiently. They transferred weights from closely related tasks, such as topic-independent dissonance stance classification and binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of PDTB. 

The team found that fine-tuning on both tasks improved zero-shot performance, and cumulative updates performed better than iterative updates. They also proposed a Probability-of-Rare-Class (PRC) strategy to select examples likely to be dissonant, which outperformed other state-of-the-art strategies. With PRC and transfer learning, they achieved a dissonance classification AUC of 0.75, the best performance so far.</sample>

    <sample id="59">The presentation discusses the development of DrBERT, a robust pre-trained model in French for biomedical and clinical domains. It begins by highlighting the importance of language modeling in healthcare, particularly in French, where there was a lack of open-source models. The researchers introduced DrBERT, a model based on RoBERTa, trained on NACHOS, a dataset of medical crawled data from the web. They also compared DrBERT with ChuBERT, a clinical model based on anonymized data from a hospital data warehouse.

The researchers trained and compared four from-scratch models, including DrBERT and ChuBERT, to analyze the impact of data size and pre-training strategy. They found that from-scratch pre-training obtained higher performance on most tasks, but control pre-training using CamemBERT weights and tokenization showed comparable results. The experiment also highlighted the importance of using specialized data, but noted that it doesn't scale well.

The evaluation of the models on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French showed that DrBERT performed best on most tasks, surpassing the generic model CamemBERT. The results also suggested that more specialized data is better, but it doesn't scale well. The pre-trained models are freely available on Hugging Face, and the training scripts are on the researchers' GitHub repository.</sample>

    <sample id="62">Nitay Calderon presents a paper on knowledge distillation for natural language generation (NLG) systems. The goal is to compress large NLG models while preserving their performance. This involves using a smaller model or pruning, followed by knowledge distillation, where a student model learns from a teacher model. The study focuses on NLG tasks, unlike previous works that focused on classification, NLU, or pre-training tasks. 

The paper explores various NLG tasks in realistic setups, defined by five criteria: medium-resource labeled data, large unlabeled data, medium-sized off-the-shelf models, high compression rate, and negligible one-time training resources. Four NLG tasks are considered: summarization, question generation, common sense reasoning, and simplification and style transfer.

The study consists of eight stages, including architectural decisions, pruning, knowledge selection, and extensions of pseudo-targets. The main contributions include the importance of unlabeled data, generating multiple pseudo-targets, and sampling pseudo-targets with high temperature to expose the student to diverse knowledge. A novel technique, joint-teaching, is proposed to address student exposure bias, grounded learning, and teaching the student to correct its own mistakes. The paper provides a recipe for distillation in NLG and invites discussion.</sample>

    <sample id="66">The authors present a survey on mathematical reasoning using deep learning methods. They discuss the task of solving math problems and proving theorems, which is a long-standing focus of AI and NLP. The authors highlight the importance of mathematical reasoning in various domains, including education, finance, and medicine. They also discuss the development of datasets, such as Numeric Commonsense Knowledge and High-Level Problem Solving, to probe human-level intelligence of language models.

The authors review various neural network architectures proposed for mathematical reasoning tasks, including sequence-to-sequence models and sequence-to-tree models. They also discuss the use of pre-trained language models, such as LLMs, to solve math word problems. However, they note that LLMs face limitations, including a lack of precise mathematical reasoning ability.

To address these limitations, the authors propose several solutions, including replacing greedy decoding strategies with self-consistency and designing program-aided LLMs. They also discuss the importance of creating datasets for low-resource languages and developing benchmarks for specific domains. Overall, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of mathematical reasoning using deep learning methods.</sample>
    <sample id="67">Researchers studied interference in multilingual translation models, where training on one language pair can either improve or hinder performance on another. They found that severe interference occurs when the model is small compared to the data size. Key factors contributing to interference include model and data size, with interference decreasing as model size increases. 

Language similarity and the number of languages were initially considered significant factors, but the study found that they have little impact on interference levels. The researchers used four variants of the Transformer architecture and trained models on 15 languages with varying data sizes.

Temperature sampling was found to be crucial in controlling interference, with tuned temperatures leading to strong performance. The study suggests that modest model scaling and tuned temperature can significantly reduce interference without the need for specialized methods. A baseline for battling interference was found to be weak due to model size and uncalibrated temperature.

The study's findings suggest that interference in multilingual translation models can be mitigated by increasing model size and tuning temperature, rather than relying on specialized algorithms. This can lead to improved performance and more effective use of multilingual translation models.</sample>

    <sample id="71">Javad Hosseini discusses their joint work with Filip Radlinski, Silvia Pareti, and Annie Louis on "Resolving Indirect Referring Expressions for Entity Selection". They introduce the AltEntities Corpus, a dataset of 6,000 alternative questions across three domains: music, books, and recipes. The dataset is collected using crowd annotation, where annotators fill in the third speech bubble of a cartoon completion setup with an indirect reference to select one of two entities. The goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice.

The researchers use a simple template to generate the alternative question, "Do you mean A or B?", where A and B are samples from Wikipedia. They experiment with different sampling methods, making the entities more similar to each other as they move up the list. They also provide background knowledge about the entities to the annotators, such as Google search links for songs and Wikipedia text for recipes and books.

The results show that a T5 XL model can achieve high accuracy when given access to the same background knowledge as the annotators, but this is not realistic. The accuracy drops to 60% when the model has access only to entity names. The researchers also demonstrate that the models are domain-generalizable.</sample>

ATOMIC contains high-quality human-annotated commonsense knowledge but lacks multi-hop paths and has unsatisfactory knowledge coverage due to missing links. To address this, the researchers constructed Dense-ATOMIC by inferring missing links between events. They proposed a new method called Rel-CSKGC, which predicts relations between events using a pre-trained language model and a clustering strategy to reduce computational cost. The method was evaluated on both automatic and human evaluation, outperforming existing relation prediction methods and translation-based methods. The constructed Dense-ATOMIC showed higher knowledge coverage and benefits the performance of COMET, a conversational AI model. The researchers also demonstrated the potential of Dense-ATOMIC for commonsense reasoning by evaluating multi-hop paths and generating diversified results. The new knowledge graph and method have the potential to improve AI models' ability to reason and understand human behavior.

    <sample id="75">Zheng Yandan presents Jointprop, a joint semi-supervised learning framework for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) tasks. Current studies neglect the interconnections between these tasks, which can lead to missing label alignment and inaccurate pseudo-labels. Jointprop aims to address this issue by fully exploiting the connections among labeled and unlabeled data, as well as between labeled and unlabeled data. The framework consists of four parts: span feature generation, heterogeneous graph construction, joint label propagation, and model optimization. 

In the span feature generation, contextualized representations of input tokens are used to initialize span and span pairs representation. A trained classifier is used to generate representations for unlabeled spans and span pairs. The heterogeneous graph construction part creates a k-Nearest Neighbor graph to examine similarity relations among pairs of unlabeled data and between labeled data. 

Joint label propagation diffuses labels through the graph, refining pseudo-labels until convergence. The model optimization part uses the converged pseudo-labels to retrain the classification model, combining the pseudo-labels with labeled data above a confidence threshold. Experiments on four datasets show that joint learning of NER and RE tasks benefits from codependency between the tasks, and Jointprop achieves significant and consistent improvement over baselines for both NER and RE tasks in single-task datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="76">The political bias propagation pipeline can be described as follows:

1. **Pretraining data**: Large-scale web crawl data, including news media from various sources (e.g., New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post), is collected.
2. **Language model training**: Language models (e.g., GPT-4, BART) are trained on the pretraining data, which can introduce political biases from the data.
3. **Language model evaluation**: The political leaning of language models is evaluated using automatic evaluation methods grounded in political science literature (e.g., political conference test).
4. **Downstream task applications**: Language models with different political leanings are fine-tuned and deployed on downstream tasks (e.g., hate speech detection, fake news detection).
5. **Fairness issues**: The political biases of language models can lead to fairness issues in downstream tasks, particularly when language models are fine-tuned on biased data and deployed on social media platforms, potentially marginalizing minority groups.</sample>
    <sample id="77">The researchers from Yale University and Microsoft Research have developed a new dataset called DeFacto to improve the factual consistency of summarization models. The dataset contains human demonstrations and feedback for editing summaries to ensure they are factually consistent with the input document. The team proposes three new Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks: summary editing, feedback generation, and automatic factual error correction. 

They collected 2.5K data points from the XSum dataset, with 70% containing factual errors. Human-edited summaries received higher automatic factuality scores than initial system outputs, but with lower textual overlap. The researchers found that fine-tuned models and zero-shot large language models can effectively leverage human feedback for summary editing. However, feedback generation remains a challenging task for both fine-tuned and large language models. 

The team achieved comparable performance in automatic factual error correction using an editor model trained on fewer data.

The DeFacto dataset provides a test bed for the proposed NLG tasks and has fine-grained annotations that can be valuable for training factuality metrics and meta-evaluation.

    <sample id="80">The watermark is inserted into the text through the "Watermark injection" step of the Embedding marker method. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. A trigger set is selected, which is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval.
2. When a user sends a sentence to the provider service, the provider counts the number of triggers in the sentence.
3. The provided embedding is a weighted summation of the original embedding and a target embedding, where the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence.
4. If the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than a threshold'm', the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding, effectively inserting the watermark.

In essence, the watermark is inserted by manipulating the embedding based on the presence of trigger words in the input sentence.</sample>

    <sample id="82">This paper proposes a novel framework, Unsupervised Automated Essay Scoring by Learning from Rank Aggregation (ULRA), to tackle the challenge of unsupervised essay scoring. Traditional automated essay scoring (AES) models rely on supervised learning with large labeled corpora, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. ULRA aims to address this limitation by introducing multiple heuristic quality signals as pseudo-groundtruth to train a neural AES model. The proposed framework consists of two main components: the Heuristic Essay Ranking module (HER) and the Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation Module (DPRA). HER generates partial-order pairs by ranking essays according to multiple quality signals, while DPRA trains a neural AES model by aggregating these partial-order pairs into a unified supervision. To address conflicts among different signals, a deep pairwise rank aggregation loss is designed to set learnable confidence weights for each signal. Experimental results demonstrate that ULRA outperforms unsupervised baselines with a large improvement, achieving competitive performance compared to cross-prompt and one-shot methods. Although its performance is still lower than supervised methods, ULRA shows promise for unsupervised essay scoring. The proposed framework has significant potential in both scientific research and practical applications, particularly in education.</sample>

    <sample id="84">Title: PAD-Net: An Efficient Framework for Dynamic Networks

Abstract:

Traditional neural networks are static, with fixed parameters that do not change with input. In contrast, dynamic networks can adapt their architecture or parameters based on input. However, fully dynamic networks often require excessive parameters, limiting their use. This paper proposes PAD-Net, a partially dynamic network framework that partitions parameters into static and dynamic components. PAD-Net uses Iterative Mode Partition to identify redundant dynamic parameters, which are then converted to static parameters. This approach aims to maintain or exceed the representation power of the original network while reducing the number of parameters and computation. Experiments show that PAD-Net achieves better performance than static and dynamic networks, and outperforms fully dynamic networks with significantly fewer parameters and computation. Ablation studies are conducted to determine the optimal Dynamic Ratios and Scale Factors for dynamic parameters and static parameters. Compared to network pruning, PAD-Net maintains better performance and produces more discriminating outputs. The authors suggest future directions, including extending PAD-Net to other mainstream networks, exploring hardware-friendly structured manners, and introducing additional modes, such as zero elements, static parameters, and dynamic parameters.</sample>

    <sample id="90">Researchers Haneul Yoo and co-authors question the necessity of recruiting native speakers for data annotation in Natural Language Processing (NLP). They conducted a proof-of-concept study to examine the feasibility of using language learners as annotators. The study targeted three languages: English, Korean, and Indonesian, and recruited both native speakers and language learners as annotators. 

The researchers designed experiments with control variables to ensure a fair comparison. They categorized language learners into three levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced, and provided additional resources for learners to consult during annotation. The study showed that labels annotated by language learners are nearly accurate, especially for simpler tasks and easy-to-medium level questions. 

Moreover, language learners' annotations were almost on par with native speakers when aggregated by majority voting. The study also demonstrated that language models trained on learners' annotations achieved high performance, sometimes outperforming models trained on native speakers' labels. The researchers observed that learners' language proficiency and vocabulary improved as they carried out annotation tasks. The study suggests a novel way for data construction by recruiting language learners as annotators, broadening NLP research for many languages, including low-resource languages where native speakers are hard to recruit.</sample>

    <sample id="94">The speaker, Jingwei Yi from the University of Science and Technology of China, is introducing a paper on protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding as services via backdoor watermark. The main issue is that attackers can steal models by learning from embedding services, making it necessary to protect the copyright of these services. 

The proposed solution is called Embedding Marker, a backdoor-based watermark method that meets four properties: applicability to embedding services, non-degradation of utility, covertness, and transferability. Embedding Marker consists of two steps: watermark injection and copyright verification.

In watermark injection, a trigger set of words is selected, and the provider service modifies the embeddings based on the number of triggers in the input sentence. The more triggers, the closer the embedding is to a target embedding.

In copyright verification, the provider constructs a backdoor and benign dataset and requests embeddings from the stealer's service. The similarity between the requested embeddings and the target embedding is computed, and the results are compared to detect whether the stealer's service contains the watermark.

Experiments on four datasets show that Embedding Marker has great detection performance while maintaining utility for downstream tasks, and the provided embeddings are covert.</sample>

    <sample id="98">To mitigate social and political biases in datasets when training NLP models, consider the following strategies:

1. **Data curation**: Ensure diverse and representative datasets by including a wide range of perspectives, sources, and authors.
2. **Data augmentation**: Introduce random noise or adversarial examples to reduce overfitting to specific biases.
3. **Regularization techniques**: Use techniques like dropout, L1/L2 regularization, or early stopping to prevent overfitting.
4. **Bias detection and removal**: Implement bias detection tools and remove or downweight biased data points.
5. **Fairness-aware evaluation metrics**: Use metrics that account for fairness and bias, such as demographic parity or equalized odds.
6. **Human evaluation and oversight**: Regularly evaluate model performance and bias with human evaluators to identify and address issues.
7. **Diverse training data**: Include data from diverse sources, such as news articles, social media, and user-generated content.
8. **Preprocessing and normalization**: Normalize and preprocess data to reduce the impact of biased language or formatting.
9. **Model selection and training**: Choose models that are less prone to bias, such as those using attention mechanisms or graph neural networks.
10. **Continuous monitoring and updating**: Regularly update and refine models to address emerging biases and ensure fairness.

Note that mitigating biases is an ongoing process, and a combination of these strategies may be necessary to achieve fair and unbiased NLP models.</sample>
    <sample id="100">The speaker discussed a new approach called PromptRank for multi-hop question answering (QA) that is data-efficient and requires fewer examples for good performance. Traditional multi-hop retrievers are trained by maximizing the probability of the ground-truth chains given questions, but this requires thousands of examples, which can be expensive, especially for low-resource domains. PromptRank combines an unsupervised retrieval method with a few-shot language model-based reranker. 

The approach has two main steps: retrieving a pool of candidate chains using TF-IDF retrieval and hyperlink traversal, and reranking these candidates using a few-shot language model reranker. The speaker discussed the scoring function and how to prompt the language model to extract this score, using the likelihood of the question given the chain according to a language model. 

The speaker also explained how to construct the chain prompt, which involves inserting the chain documents into the prompt and an instruction to elicit the language model's reasoning ability. The approach was evaluated on the HotpotQA dataset and compared to state-of-the-art multi-hop retrievers, showing that PromptRank outperforms fully supervised systems and exhibits strong few-shot path retrieval performance.</sample>

    <sample id="106">The speaker discusses a dataset called QUEST, which is designed to study the effectiveness of systems in handling selective information needs. QUEST is a retrieval dataset containing over 3,000 entity-seeking queries with implicit set operations. The dataset was constructed by performing set operations over Wikipedia category names from four domains: films, books, plants, and animals. Human annotators paraphrased and validated the queries to ensure fluency and naturalness. 

The speaker explains that the dataset poses a challenging retrieval problem as systems need to effectively search over a large document corpus to find multi-answer sets where attribution for different query constraints can come from different parts of the document. To evaluate systems on the dataset, the speaker requires systems to retrieve multi-answer sets from a large document corpus where queries contain implicit set constraints.

The speaker presents baseline results using sparse and dense retrievers, as well as a T5-based reranker. The results show a large room for improvement on retriever performance and low end-to-end system performance in terms of F1 scores. The speaker finds that queries with set intersection and set difference are particularly challenging and have the lowest F1 scores.</sample>

    <sample id="108">Researchers Koustav Sinha and colleagues revisited the minimal pair paradigm (MPP) to evaluate language models on acceptability judgments. They aimed to assess the models' ability to handle longer context windows, which are increasingly common in large language models. The traditional MPP pipeline evaluates models on short, single-sentence inputs, but this may not capture the models' abstract knowledge throughout the context window.

The researchers recreated longer sequences by combining acceptable or unacceptable sentences from relevant datasets, such as BLiMP or SyntaxGym. They tested the models' acceptability judgments with these longer sequences, including mismatch scenarios where the context came from a different subset or domain. The results showed that the models' judgments were mostly robust to arbitrary context length, but sensitive to context when the sentences came from the same dataset or matched the grammatical structure.

The researchers found that the models were sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences, and that the traditional MPP evaluation may not fully capture the models' abstract knowledge. The study's key takeaways highlight the importance of considering context and abstract knowledge in language model evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="109">Researchers introduce Unnatural Instructions, a large dataset of natural language instructions for various tasks, collected in a fully automatic manner without human labor. The dataset is generated by prompting a pre-trained language model, specifically a variant of GPT-3, with examples from the Super-Natural Instructions dataset. The model is asked to generate a fourth example, and the process is repeated to diversify the dataset's format. The resulting dataset contains 64,000 examples, with approximately 240,000 examples when including instruction paraphrases. The generated examples are analyzed for creativity, diversity, and correctness, showing that over 50% are correct and even incorrect examples contain valuable information.

To measure the utility of the dataset, an 11 billion-parameter T5 model is fine-tuned on Unnatural Instructions and outperforms T0++ and Tk-instruct across several benchmarks. When the cost of generating examples is amortized, training on Unnatural Instructions outperforms the baseline on all benchmarks. The researchers highlight the ability of language models to produce creative and diverse data, which is difficult to obtain with human annotations. This approach is faster and cheaper than human annotations, making it a promising alternative for collecting instruction data.</sample>

    <sample id="114">Researchers from Nanyang Technological University of Singapore presented their work on "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention" at ACL 2023. The team aimed to address the limitations of large language models, specifically the heavy parameters, long training time, and token-hungry nature. They focused on the multi-head attention mechanism and proposed a new approach called Grouped Head Attention (GHA). 

GHA uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to compress multi-head attention by dividing attention heads into groups and pruning redundant heads. The approach consists of two stages: group-constrained training and the Voting-to-Stay algorithm. The first stage aims to make intra-group heads similar and inter-group heads separate, while the second stage prunes redundant heads based on their scores.

The researchers evaluated their approach on three tasks: machine translation, language modeling, and abstractive summarization. They achieved significant performance improvements and parameter compression, with the GHA model compressing up to 90% of parameters without sacrificing performance. The team also conducted further efficiency analysis, showing that their LITE model achieved faster inference speed and reduced FLOPs. They believe that task-specific automatic pruning is a promising direction for future research.</sample>

    <sample id="118">The presentation discussed a new pretraining technique for code-switched NLP, called SwitchMLM, to improve performance on tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. Code-switching refers to the occurrence of multiple languages within a single sentence or utterance, common in linguistically diverse communities like India. 

The proposed method, SwitchMLM, is a variant of the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) technique, where only switch-points (transitions between languages) are maskable. However, this approach requires access to LID tagged datasets or a LID tagger, which may not be available. To overcome this limitation, a surrogate method called FrequencyMLM was proposed, which assigns LID tags based on negative log likelihood of words in monolingual corpora.

The presentation also discussed architectural modifications to enhance code-switching performance. Residual connections were added to increase the amount of switch-point information in the final layer, and an auxiliary LID-based loss was imposed to encourage intermediate layers to encode language information. The results showed that the combined method performed best on sentiment analysis tasks. Probing experiments verified the claim that the proposed methods increase switch-point information in intermediate and final layers.</sample>

    <sample id="123">Ying and Zhiyang presented their research on MultiInstruct, a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset that improves multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning. They found that previous works on instruction tuning focused on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multi-modal tasks were left out. To address this, they created MultiInstruct, the first large-scale publicly-available multi-modal instruction task dataset, consisting of 62 diverse tasks covering 10 categories. The dataset is derived from 21 existing open-source datasets and each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions.

Their experiment used the OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as the base model. They trained the model on 53 tasks from 9 groups and tested on 9 unseen tasks. They found that instruction tuning can significantly improve OFA's performance on seen multi-modal tasks and that transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can benefit instruction tuning. They also introduced a new metric called sensitivity, which measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variations in instruction wording.

Their results showed that using more instructions can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity. Transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can also improve the model's performance on natural instruction tasks. Overall, their research proposes the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset and explores different transfer learning techniques, showing their benefits. They are also collecting a larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset and will release it.</sample>
    <sample id="124">Researchers from the National University of Singapore and Alibaba presented a study on improving the temporal reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). They proposed a comprehensive framework for temporal reasoning, breaking it down into three levels: time-to-time reasoning, time-to-event reasoning, and event-to-event reasoning. 

The researchers created a new dataset, TempReason, which covers all three levels of reasoning and has long temporal coverage. They evaluated LMs in three QA problem settings: Closed Book QA, Open Book QA, and Reasoning QA. 

To improve LMs' temporal reasoning, they proposed a training strategy with two components: Temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning. They also introduced a new model, TempT5, which outperformed other models in several settings. 

However, the researchers found that even TempT5 had performance fluctuations over different time periods, which could be related to training data imbalance. They also exposed the temporal reasoning biases of LMs, particularly in ChatGPT, which performed well in year prediction but poorly in month prediction. 

The study aims to promote a more comprehensive understanding of temporal reasoning and provide a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities.</sample>

    <sample id="127">Researchers Namgyu Ho, Laura Schmid, and Se-Young Yun from KAIST AI in Korea introduced their work, "Large Language Models Are Reasoning Teachers." The study aims to enable smaller language models to perform complex reasoning tasks by leveraging the abilities of larger models. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, a technique that involves breaking down complex tasks into step-by-step solutions, is only effective in large models due to their high computational requirements. The researchers propose using these large models as "reasoning teachers" to transfer their abilities to smaller models. 

They developed a novel technique called Diverse Reasoning, which involves generating multiple step-by-step solutions from the teacher model using stochastic temperature sampling. This diverse set of solutions is then used to train the smaller model, significantly improving its performance in complex reasoning tasks. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of this method on 12 tasks, outperforming existing baselines and vanilla fine-tuning. The results show that smaller models can perform complex reasoning tasks with notable accuracy, making this method a scalable and accessible approach for real-world applications.</sample>
    <sample id="128">Akshatha and Martin presented their work, "The KITMUS Test: Evaluating Knowledge Integration from Multiple Sources," a collaboration between McGill University, Mila, and Microsoft Research. The study focuses on natural language understanding models that draw from various knowledge sources, including pretraining data and inference-time information. They proposed a diagnostic test suite, KITMUS, to evaluate a model's ability to integrate knowledge from different sources. The test suite includes a coreference resolution task that requires entity-specific and background knowledge.

The researchers evaluated the data set with human participants and established coreference resolution models, such as C2F and BERT4Coref. The results showed that without task-specific training, the models performed poorly, but with training on KITMUS, they significantly improved. However, even the best-performing models struggled to integrate background knowledge provided only at inference time. The study suggests that many coreference resolution models are unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training. The authors have made the paper, data set, and code available on GitHub for further exploration.</sample>

    <sample id="135">Researchers from the Emory NLP Lab, led by Professor Jinho Choi, and Amazon Alexa AI have developed a new approach to evaluating conversational AI called ABC-Eval. This method aims to provide a more precise and reliable evaluation of chat models by annotating specific behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting oneself. ABC-Eval measures various thematic errors, including ignoring the partner, saying something irrelevant, contradicting oneself or its partner, hallucinating incorrect facts, and violating common sense knowledge. 

The researchers evaluated four state-of-the-art chat models using ABC-Eval and compared the results with three existing methods: Likert ratings on the turn-level, Likert ratings on the dialogue-level, and dialogue-level pairwise comparisons. The analysis showed that ABC-Eval behavior labels are more reliable and predictive of conversation quality compared to existing methods. The combination of ABC-Eval metrics explained over 25% of conversation quality, while existing methods explained far less. The study highlights the importance of reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing chat models and suggests that ABC-Eval can be a meaningful step in this direction. The researchers hope that ABC-Eval will be leveraged by others in the field to advance the development of conversational AI.</sample>
    <sample id="136">Researchers Jasivan and Nafise from the University of Sheffield introduced FERMAT, a flexible evaluation set for numerical reasoning, to address the limitations of current benchmarks. These benchmarks often provide accuracy scores or F1 measures, which do not reveal the strengths and weaknesses of models in mathematical ability. FERMAT consists of maths worded questions from Illinois and CommonCore, with variations in number representation (e.g., large integers, decimals) and mathematical operations (e.g., addition, multiplication). 

The researchers conducted a baseline evaluation, finding that most models performed poorly across various aspects. Fine-tuning with math teacher-written templates led to improved performance, particularly in generating questions involving different number types. However, even with fine-tuning, models struggled with exact expressions, suggesting a need for linguistic understanding. 

The impact of training templates was also investigated, with results showing that increased language and mathematical diversity improved performance. FERMAT aims to provide a more informative alternative to existing benchmarks, highlighting the importance of language and mathematical diversity in numerical reasoning tasks. The study identifies areas for improvement, including number encoding and tokenization, and encourages further research in this area.</sample>
    <sample id="137">Researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design proposed a novel task called "Tell2Design" - generating floor plans directly from language instructions. They created a large-scale dataset, Tell2Design, featuring 5,051 human-annotated and 76,000 artificially generated language instructions for floor plans. The task aims to enable users without expertise to design by providing instructions, enhancing the design process. The main challenges include stricter constraints, understanding the big picture from unstructured text, and dealing with ambiguous or misleading information.

To tackle this task, the researchers cast the floor plan generation as a sequence-to-sequence problem under the encoder-decoder framework. They used a transformer-based model initialized with a pre-trained language model (T5) and achieved the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) scores on the T2D dataset. The results outperformed text-conditional image generation baselines by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.

However, when training only on artificial instructions, the method struggled to perform well on human-written instructions due to a language distribution gap. Nevertheless, using artificial instructions for warming up before training on human instructions significantly improved the performance. The study concluded by introducing Tell2Design as a foundation for future research on language-guided design generation.</sample>

Dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization that creates a concise summary of a dialogue. Despite recent progress using large-scale pre-trained language models, generated summaries often contain errors, including omission, which is a major factor affecting summary quality. Omission refers to the missing content in generated summaries, presented in the gold reference. The paper analyzed the omission problem in dialogue summarization and found that even state-of-the-art models reach a high omission rate of 70%. To address this issue, the authors constructed the OLDS dataset, which provides high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization. They also proposed an automatic method to produce omission labels and performed human evaluation to ensure label quality. The authors explored three frameworks as baselines for omission detection and found that the task is challenging, with a F1-score of around 50%. However, they also found that using omission to refine summaries can improve summary quality, suggesting that omission detection is a valuable task for quality improvement in dialogue summarization.</sample>

The dataset is unique due to its long, domain-specific, and information-rich transcripts, as well as the variety of question types and answer scenarios. The data collection process involved annotating sentences in the answer span, resulting in a high inter-annotator agreement.

The paper also explores the performance of various models on the MeetingQA dataset, including fine-tuned and zero-shot settings. Results show a significant gap between human performance and model performance, with short-context models like RoBERTa performing better than long-context models like Longformer. The paper also highlights the challenges of identifying rhetorical questions and speaker answers, particularly in the zero-shot setting. The MeetingQA dataset is considered far from being solved, with existing QA models struggling to perform well in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.

    <sample id="152">Frederick Riemenschneider presented "Exploring Large Language Models for Classical Philology," discussing the development of new language models for Ancient Greek and Latin. Current models, such as Latin BERT and Ancient Greek BERT, are encoder-only and monolingual, limiting their capabilities. To address this, Riemenschneider and his team created GreBERTa, GreTa, PhilBERTa, and PhilTa, which are monolingual and multilingual models, respectively. These models are designed to push the state-of-the-art in classical philology, explore different architectures, and introduce multilingual capabilities.

The team gathered pre-training data from Open Greek &amp; Latin, previously unused resources, and a new corpus from the Internet Archive. They developed a method to identify and correct OCR errors in Greek texts, resulting in a high-quality pre-training dataset. The models were benchmarked using the Universal Dependencies treebanks and EvaLatina 2022 dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and lemmatization. The team also analyzed the performance of GreTa's encoder and found that it approaches the performance of a native encoder-only model after more training. The results show that the models have elevated lemmatization performance and significantly outperform previous models in semantic and world knowledge tasks.</sample>

The team proposed a pipeline to address this issue, including a benchmark dataset, a prompt disambiguation framework, and an automatic evaluation framework.

The benchmark dataset, a modified version of the LAVA corpus, covers different types of ambiguities. The prompt disambiguation framework uses in-context learning to generate clarifying questions or possible visual setups. Users interact with the system to provide disambiguated prompts. The automatic evaluation framework uses a VQA model to evaluate whether generated images are faithful to user intention.

The study found disparities in resolving ambiguities for different types of ambiguities, but overall, disambiguation using the framework had a positive effect on faithful generation. The automatic evaluation framework was also found to be in agreement with human evaluation. The research proposes frameworks to mitigate and evaluate ambiguities in text-to-image models, aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of generated images.</sample>

    <sample id="157">Shen Gao from Shandong University introduced their work on "Dialogue Summarization with Static-Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph" in collaboration with Xin Cheng, Mingzhe Li, Xiuying Chen, Jinpeng Li, Dongyan Zhao, and Rui Yan. The goal of dialogue summarization is to extract essential information from a conversation and condense it into a concise summary. Existing methods rely on pre-computed static graph structures, which have limitations due to their reliance on external tools and inability to adapt to downstream tasks.

Their proposed model, SDDS, consists of four components: Utterance Encoder, Static Graph construction, Static-Dynamic Graph module, and Summary Generator. SDDS combines multiple static graphs and uses a dynamic graph module to capture semantic relationships between utterances. Four heuristic dialogue structure modeling methods are proposed to build relationships between utterances: Discourse Parsing Graph, Key Co-occurrence, Speaker Relationship Modeling, and Utterance Position Graph.

The Static-Dynamic Graph module integrates the static and dynamic graphs using a fusion method and a dual cross-attention mechanism. This allows the model to capture both static dialogue structure information and dynamic semantic relationships between utterances, ultimately generating a more accurate summary. The code and data are available on GitHub.</sample>
    <sample id="158">Qipeng Guo from AWS presented their work, "Dual Cache for Long Document Neural Coreference Resolution". The task of coreference resolution involves identifying and clustering mentions of the same entity in a document. Conventional methods have quadratic complexity, while cache-based methods reduce complexity to linear level. However, in long documents with topic switching, cache-based methods like LRU can lead to high cache misses. The proposed dual cache method consists of a local cache with LRU eviction and a global cache with LFU eviction. The model scans the document and adds new mentions to either the local or global cache based on their frequency. When the cache is full, it triggers the eviction policy. Experiments on four public benchmarks showed that dual cache outperforms baselines even with unbounded memory. Without training data, the model with unbounded memory performs slightly better, but dual cache is still faster. The dual cache significantly reduces cache misses and has the highest performance/cost ratio compared to single cache methods. Overall, the dual cache method improves the efficiency and effectiveness of coreference resolution in long documents.</sample>

    <sample id="165">Wenting Zhao, a PhD student at Cornell University, presented a paper titled "Abductive Commonsense Reasoning Exploiting Mutually Exclusive Explanations". The paper focuses on abductive reasoning, a process that identifies a plausible explanation bridging the gap between a given context and an outcome. Traditional approaches rely on supervised methods, which require annotated explanations, but these can be noisy and subjective. To address this issue, Zhao introduced an unsupervised learning method called LiPoR, which maximizes the marginal likelihood of the outcome given the context. However, this objective alone does not prefer plausible explanations, so an additional regularizer is needed. The regularizer, denoted by Omega, enforces the mutual exclusivity among explanations, which is a significant characteristic of explanations. The LiPoR objective consists of two parts: maximizing the likelihood of outcomes and preferring some explanations over others. The results on the AlphaNLI dataset show that LiPoR outperforms zero-shot models and the previous best unsupervised approach, achieving over 4 absolute points in accuracy. The paper concludes that it is possible to learn abductive reasoning without supervision regarding the plausibility of explanations, and LiPoR is a successful example of this approach.</sample>
    <sample id="166">Yunxin from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, presented their new work, "A Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning Framework for Image Retrieval from Linguistically Complex Text." The current image retrieval methods struggle with linguistically complex text due to their focus on analogical reasoning. Inspired by the Divide-and-Conquer strategy and Dual-Process Theory, the proposed method integrates two thinking systems: System 1 for analogical reasoning and System 2 for abstract logical reasoning.

The proposed method, NDCR, consists of three modules: the Proposition Generator, Visual-Linguistic Interactor, and Neural-Symbolic Reasoner. The Proposition Generator decomposes complex proposition text into simple propositions. The Visual-Linguistic Interactor performs visual-propositions' information interaction, and the Neural-Symbolic Reasoner integrates the reasoning states and results of simple propositions to obtain the final solution.

Experimental results show that NDCR outperforms other baselines, and abolition experiments verify the effectiveness of each module. The proposed method can present inference states and results in the middle step, demonstrating interoperability. The authors suggest that neural symbolic calculation may improve compositional reasoning and planning of large language models, and that Divide-and-Conquer and Dual-Process Theory can be integrated for solving complex problems.</sample>

    <sample id="169">Researchers from Google Translate presented a study on the use of large language models (LLMs) for machine translation, specifically evaluating the PaLM model. PaLM, a 540 billion-parameter LLM, achieved state-of-the-art performance in hundreds of NLP tasks. The study focused on the impact of prompting strategies on PaLM's translation capabilities. The researchers found that the quality of examples used in prompting is more important than their similarity to the source sentence. They also discovered that the form of the prompting does not significantly affect performance when using multiple examples, but it is crucial in zero and one-shot prompting scenarios.

The study compared PaLM's performance to state-of-the-art systems and commercial translations, finding that while PaLM comes close to commercial systems, specialized state-of-the-art systems still have a significant advantage. Human evaluation using the MQM framework revealed that PaLM's fluency is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but its accuracy is lower due to common errors such as omissions. The study provides recommendations for prompt selection strategies and emphasizes the importance of selecting high-quality examples for optimal performance. Overall, the study highlights the potential of large language models for machine translation and the need for further research to improve their accuracy and reliability.</sample>

    <sample id="174">This presentation discusses the unique features of the ArgAnalysis35K dataset, a large-scale collection of argument quality analysis pairs. Unlike existing datasets, ArgAnalysis35K boasts high-quality arguments sourced from expert debaters, speeches, and intermediate debaters, with only 15% from novice debaters or everyday people. The dataset covers 24 diverse themes, capturing as many motions as possible, rather than pre-selecting a few. A novel aspect of the dataset is the introduction of "analysis," which combines claims, premises, and links to explain arguments more coherently. 

To ensure annotator reliability, the dataset employs instance-based annotator reliability, eliminating biased judgments on a per-argument basis rather than excluding entire annotators. Additionally, a relevance model assigns a score to each argument's relevance to a particular theme, capturing its applicability across various topics. The ArgAnalysis35K dataset offers a more diverse, high-quality, and reliable scoring system, making it a valuable resource for the NLP community. The presentation invites feedback on the paper and dataset, highlighting the potential for ArgAnalysis35K to advance argument quality analysis and its applications in various fields.</sample>

    <sample id="179">The paper discusses improving Theory of Mind reasoning skills in Large Language Models (LLMs). Theory of Mind is the ability to reason about the mental state of others, traditionally measured through reading comprehension tasks involving multiple characters. The authors present SymbolicToM, an inference-time method that uses explicit graphical representations to improve LLMs' Theory of Mind reasoning skills. This method computes graphical representations of characters' beliefs about each other's beliefs, allowing for efficient answering of questions about mental states. Experiments show that SymbolicToM significantly improves out-of-the-box LLM performance on second-order false-belief questions, with performance gains of up to 65 accuracy points for GPT3-Davinci. The method also generalizes well to out-of-domain story understanding and remains beneficial on a dataset with linguistic diversity. The authors design three new datasets to test SymbolicToM's generalization capabilities, including a dataset that concatenates two stories and asks about both, and a dataset with paraphrased sentences. Results show that SymbolicToM outperforms supervised approaches on these datasets, particularly for stronger models like GPT-4, which achieves a 42-point accuracy boost on one of the datasets. Overall, the paper presents a plug-and-play method that improves LLMs' Theory of Mind reasoning skills and provides more interpretable reasoning.</sample>

    <sample id="181">This research aims to address the under-studied problem of constrained language planning, where language models are tasked with generating step-by-step instructions for specific goals with multiple constraints. The authors propose the "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning" method, which involves using InstructGPT to generate scripts for specific goals and then filtering the results to ensure faithfulness to the constraints. The team develops an over-generate-then-filter approach, which first generates multiple scripts for a specific goal and then selects the most faithful one based on semantic similarity and keyword matching.

To evaluate the performance of large language models, the researchers create a dataset of specific goals with scripts, named CoScript, by distilling knowledge from large language models using symbolic knowledge distillation. The CoScript dataset consists of 55,000 specific goals with scripts and is validated through crowd-sourced workers. The results show that smaller models, such as T5 fine-tuned on CoScript, can surpass larger models in generating high-quality scripts for constrained language planning. This research contributes to advancing the field of language planning by establishing the constrained language planning problem, evaluating the performance of large language models, and providing a valuable resource, CoScript, for future research.</sample>

    <sample id="192">Yang Luo presented a new optimizer called CAME (Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization) for training large language models. Traditional adaptive optimizers like Adam require a lot of memory to store moment estimates, while memory-efficient optimizers like Adafactor sacrifice performance for reduced memory usage. CAME aims to achieve both fast convergence and low memory usage.

CAME is inspired by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which reduces memory requirements by factorizing a matrix into two smaller matrices. However, NMF operations in Adafactor can cause erroneous updates, leading to slow convergence.

To address this, CAME introduces a confidence-guided approach that adapts to the residual between predicted and generated updates. This approach reduces the impact of erroneous updates and improves stability.

Experiments on BERT, GPT-2, and T5 show that CAME achieves significant improvements in validation accuracy and reduces memory usage compared to Adam and Adafactor. CAME also outperforms Adafactor in large batch training and reduces memory footprint compared to SM3. Overall, CAME is a confidence-guided memory-efficient optimizer that achieves outstanding effectiveness on large language model training tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The researchers proposed a novel framework called RoHT (Reasoning over Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree) for Explainable Question Answering (XQA). The framework aims to answer complex questions and provide explanations for the selected answers. RoHT consists of two stages: building a Hierarchical Question Decomposition Tree (HQDT) and probabilistic reasoning over the tree. The HQDT is constructed by decomposing a complex question into sub-questions and leaf nodes, which are atomic questions that cannot be further decomposed. 

The researchers then proposed probabilistic reasoning over the HQDT to fuse knowledge from a knowledge base and a text corpus. The reasoning process involves selecting the appropriate knowledge sources, obtaining answers with probabilities, and aggregating candidate answers. The framework is evaluated on two challenging complex QA datasets, KQA Pro and Musique. The results show that RoHT outperforms existing methods, including KB QA methods and end-to-end trained models, in terms of accuracy and F1 score. The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating knowledge from heterogeneous sources and utilizing explicit decomposition for complex question answering. The results also show the benefits of supplementing text information with knowledge from a knowledge base.</sample>

    <sample id="205">Researchers at the University of Washington have investigated the impact of political biases in language models on downstream tasks. They found that language models, trained on large-scale web crawl data, can learn and reflect the diverse perspectives of pretraining data, including those from news media outlets with varying political leanings. However, this has created a mixed blessing, as the models can also perpetuate social biases and fairness issues in applications such as hate speech detection and fake news detection. 

The researchers proposed a framework to track the propagation of political biases from pretraining data to language models and downstream tasks. They evaluated language models with different prompt formats and found that they occupy all four quadrants on the political spectrum, with GPT-4 being the most liberal. They also conducted a controlled experiment, further pretraining language models on partisan corpora, and found that the models' ideological coordinates shifted accordingly.

The study revealed that language models can pick up polarization in society and that their performance on downstream tasks varies depending on their political leaning. For example, left-leaning models were better at detecting hate speech targeting minority groups, but worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups. The researchers highlighted the pressing fairness issue and the dilemma of balancing the need to sanitize political opinions in language model training data with the risk of censorship or exclusion.</sample>

    <sample id="215">Adam Przepiórkowski presented a paper arguing for symmetric structures of coordination in linguistics. He discussed the dependency structure of coordination, which varies across theories and corpus approaches. Asymmetric approaches, such as the Universal Dependencies and Mel'čuk's Meaning-Text Theory, single out one conjunct as the head of the coordinate structure. In contrast, symmetric approaches, like the Prague Dependency Treebanks and Hudson's Word Grammar, consider all conjuncts as heads.

Adam's argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization, which states that shorter dependencies are preferred. He used examples to illustrate how this principle can explain the acceptability of certain sentences, even if they violate general grammatical principles. He also presented statistics from the Penn Treebank, which confirm that left conjuncts tend to be shorter than right conjuncts, especially when the governor is on the left or absent. This effect disappears when the governor is on the right. Adam's findings provide an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination and in favor of symmetric structures.</sample>
    <sample id="217">Researchers Weihao Zeng, Lulu Zhao, and Keqing He from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications proposed a method called Disentangled Controllable Generation (DCG) for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation. They aimed to address the limitations of previous methods that focus on single attributes or combine controllers for discrete attributes, but not for continuous attributes. 

DCG learns attribute concepts from seen values and uses a disentanglement loss to disentangle different attribute combinations. The model is based on the DialoGPT framework with a compositional prompt module. Two types of prompts, attribute-oriented and task-oriented, are designed to guide the model's focus on specific information and global features. 

To improve the generation ability and distinguish between different attribute value combinations, pseudo combinations are designed and a disentanglement loss is introduced. A unified and efficient evaluation framework, called MAE, is proposed to evaluate the controllability of the model without requiring additional labeled data. 

Experiments show that DCG outperforms other baselines in attribute controllability and text equality. The proposed method successfully tackles the challenges of compositional generalization for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation, and its effectiveness is confirmed through various evaluations and comparisons.</sample>

    <sample id="219">Academia Sinica research assistant Jia-Huei Ju presented a study on financial report analysis, specifically focusing on the annual report, Form 10-K, required by the SEC. The work aimed to uncover financial signals in these reports, which are time-consuming to mine manually. Observing that 80% of tokens in reports are similar and yearly-dependent, the team introduced a highlighting task and a multi-stage pipeline. 

The pipeline consists of four stages: document segmentation (omitted due to time constraints), relation recognition, out-of-domain fine-tuning, and in-domain fine-tuning. In the relation recognition stage, pairs are classified into three types: β (high syntactic and semantic similarities), revised (similar patterns, different meanings), and mismatched (new information). 

For fine-tuning, an external dataset, eSNLI, is used for out-of-domain adaptation, and revised pairs are used for in-domain fine-tuning. The model is evaluated using two metrics: precision over recall and correlation between predictions and annotations. The results show that the domain-adaptive highlighting model achieves the best performance on the FINAL dataset and generalizes well to the eSNLI dataset. The study also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on mismatched pairs, which were not used during training.</sample>

    <sample id="222">Researchers investigated domain adaptation in open-domain question answering by analyzing the challenges and interventions for adapting to new domains. They proposed three main contributions: investigating data interventions, identifying the type of dataset shift, and determining the effective interventions for each shift. 

They experimented with seven target passage and datasets spanning six different domains, including biomedical, and found that simply expanding the document collection to include biomedical documents did not improve performance due to the source model's inability to discriminate between domains. 

The researchers explored two data intervention methods: zero-shot and few-shot. Zero-shot techniques controlled the interactions among question, answer, and context variables by varying one while keeping the others fixed. Few-shot methods used a few examples from the target domain to prompt large language models for generating more examples. 

They also developed a compatibility measure to assess the source model's compatibility with the target dataset and mapped the datasets onto a 2D grid to estimate the type of dataset shift. The results showed that certain types of data interventions were effective based on the type of shift a target dataset exhibited, and that few-shot adaptations were effective for most datasets, while zero-shot adaptations were effective for datasets with concept and covariate shift.</sample>

    <sample id="227">Researchers have identified a gap in current language models' research, specifically in grounded language understanding, which involves mapping natural language expressions onto executable representations in a target environment. The main challenge lies in the lack of grounding during pre-training, resulting in generated plans or programs that may not be grammatical or valid. 

To address this issue, the researchers propose a novel framework, Pangu, which separates the task of generating plans from the task of evaluating and ranking them. Pangu uses a symbolic agent to propose candidate plans, while a language model scores and ranks these candidates, making it easier for the model to excel in discrimination rather than generation.

Experiments on knowledge-based question answering demonstrate Pangu's outstanding performance across various settings, including fine-tuning and in-context learning. Pangu also shows strong sample efficiency and robustness under non-i.i.d. settings, outperforming baseline models in many cases. The researchers conclude that for grounded language understanding, generation may not be the best strategy, and instead, discrimination might be a more effective approach using language models.</sample>

The authors focus on the revision process of argumentative writing and aim to formalize what makes a claim well-phrased. They introduce two new tasks: Suboptimal-Claim detection and Claim Improvement Suggestion. To tackle these tasks, they explore the challenges of working with revision-based data from collaborative online debate platforms like Kialo. The authors identify four main challenges: Representativity and Reliability, Model Complexity and Architecture, Contextual Information, and Topical and User Bias. They present a detailed analysis of strategies to tackle each challenge and a systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced tasks. The experiments show that revision-based data can be effectively employed for the given tasks, and modeling the distance between two claimed versions is beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims. The impact of contextual information is found to be dependent on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from. The paper concludes that revision-based data can be a valuable resource for improving argumentative writing, and the findings provide insights into the challenges and opportunities of working with such data.</sample>

They addressed the challenges of current SimulST models, which require additional modules, long training procedures, and multiple models for different latency regimes.

Their solution, EDAtt (Encoder-Decoder Attention), utilizes existing offline ST models without retraining or adopting specific architectures. EDAtt handles latency through specific parameters and leverages the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output. It decides whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to, emitting a word if the attention is not concentrated on the last speech frames.

The researchers compared EDAtt with popular strategies applied to offline models, such as Wait-k and Local Agreement, and a state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous pre-translation. The results showed that EDAtt outperformed all strategies on German simultaneous speech translation, with curves shifted to the left and high BLEU scores. EDAtt also achieved the fastest actual elapsed time and computational-aware time. The paper and code are available for reproducibility.</sample>

The dataset includes 1,366 City Council meetings and nearly 7,000 instances, with meeting transcripts, reference summaries, and other useful resources. To collect the data, the team used Speechmatics API to convert audio data to transcripts and extracted meeting segments, timestamps, and reference summaries from meeting minutes.

The dataset statistics show that most City Council meeting summaries have a coverage score between 0.7 to 0.9, indicating a focus on verbatim points over abstraction. For model evaluation, top-tier summarization systems were evaluated on the test set of MeetingBank, including extractive and abstractive models.

Human evaluation was conducted using a 5-point Likert scaling, and the results showed that GPT-3 achieved the highest overall scores, with exceptional performance in terms of fluency and coherence. However, the results were less impressive in terms of informativeness and factuality. The findings suggest that meeting summarization solutions should focus on capturing main discussion points and that new evaluation metrics should be developed to better align with human preference. MeetingBank is a useful tool for researchers and provides insights into City Council decision-making processes.</sample>
    <sample id="241">Researchers at Georgia Tech proposed a human-in-the-loop evaluation framework for early misinformation detection, specifically targeting COVID-19 treatments on social media. The existing approaches are often unrealistically evaluated and not human-centric, neglecting the involvement of human content moderators. The proposed framework addresses these deficiencies by integrating human feedback at various stages of the process, from raw tweets to actionable outputs used by humans.

The system consists of two main components: the first detects misleading claims using a T5 model for question answering and keyword filtering, while the second focuses on policy violation verification using a BERT-based stance classification model. The system outputs verified lists of misinformed claims and flags social media policy violations for human review.

The researchers evaluated the efficacy of their framework through operationalizing early detection as the detection of unapproved treatments before their first appearance in debunking news articles. They found that their system has a 65% accuracy rate in policy violation detection and can detect 124.2 policy violations per human hour worked. The framework provides a more realistic and human-centric approach to misinformation detection, motivating the development of future human-in-the-loop systems.</sample>

    <sample id="245">The research, titled "A Needle in a Haystack: An Analysis of High-Agreement Workers on MTurk for Summarization," presents a two-step pipeline for identifying high-agreement workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for summarization tasks. The pipeline consists of two stages: a qualification task and an endurance task. The qualification task evaluates a worker's ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly, categorizing them into four types: gold, silver, bronze, and block. Only gold and silver workers pass this task, resulting in 26 qualified workers.

The endurance task tests a worker's capacity for handling heavy workloads, with 12 workers passing and achieving high agreement in terms of inter-annotator agreement (IAA). The pipeline's results show that 8 out of 12 workers finished all HITs, with a Krippendorff's Alpha of 0.534. The research also compares the pipeline's results to baseline MTurk workers and CloudResearch MTurk workers, finding that the pipeline achieves similar quality at a lower cost. The study concludes that the pipeline serves as a best practice for high-agreement annotations at large scale and lower cost, and suggests future directions for hiring high-quality workers and exploring multiple applications.</sample>

    <sample id="247">Jiho Kim from KAIST AI presented the paper "FACTKG: Fact Verification via Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs." Existing fact verification datasets, such as FEVER and TabFact, use text and table-based evidence, but none utilize knowledge graphs. The proposed task, Knowledge Graph-Based Fact Verification, leverages knowledge graphs as evidence with natural language claims. 

A new dataset, FactKG, was introduced, using DBpedia as the knowledge graph. Claims exist in written and colloquial styles, and the task involves retrieving evidence from DBpedia and verifying the claim using the evidence. Five types of reasoning are included: one-hop, conjunction, existence, multi-hop, and negation.

The dataset includes colloquial style claims, achieved through two methods: a colloquial style transfer model and presupposition templates. Statistics of the dataset were presented, and baselines were constructed in two ways: Claim Only and GEAR model using graph evidence. The results showed that all baselines outperformed the majority class baseline, and the GEAR model outperformed all other baselines when using graph evidence. The paper concludes that FactKG can be used in various tasks requiring consistency checks between knowledge graphs and natural language.</sample>

The team aimed to improve Prior Case Retrieval, a task that involves retrieving relevant past precedents for legal professionals. They created a new benchmark dataset, IL-PCR, which consists of 7,070 Indian legal cases with 6.775 average citations per query document. The U-CREAT pipeline uses unsupervised learning techniques and an event-based approach to achieve high retrieval efficiency and low inference time. 

The pipeline extracts events from case documents using dependency parsing and forms subject-verb-object triplets. An interaction matrix is computed between query and candidate events, and the green blocks represent common events. The team conducted experiments using various models, including count-based, transformer-based, and event-based models. The event-based models, particularly the Event Filtered Documents model, outperformed other methods with a significant boost in performance. U-CREAT achieved state-of-the-art results on the COLIEE'21 document retrieval task and offers avenues for further exploration and development in the field of prior case retrieval.</sample>
    <sample id="253">Mario Ezra Aragón presented a research work named "DisorBERT: A Double Domain Adaptation Model for Detecting Signs of Mental Disorders in Social Media". The goal of this project is to automatically analyze social media posts to detect mental health disorders and provide early warnings. The team used a language model, BERT, and adapted it to a more specific domain of Reddit and mental health. They also incorporated a lexicon to guide the masking process, focusing the model on important words during training.

The proposed approach, DisorBERT, achieved better results than the baseline models, including MentalBERT. The evaluation showed a good balance between precision and recall. To illustrate the model's behavior, the team analyzed the most likely words generated when given a sentence with masked words. DisorBERT tended to predict words related to mental disorders, such as "focus", "talk", "breath", "sleep", and "eat", while BERT generated more general words.

The team also visualized the most important sequences of text in a user's post, highlighting words related to "anxious" and "medication". The combined effect of double domain adaptation and guided masking proved effective in capturing signs of mental disorders in social media interactions. Future work includes exploring different lexical resources and using clinical data to further improve the model's performance.</sample>
    <sample id="254">Researchers from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, led by Sun Qi, proposed a novel framework for document-level distant relation extraction. The framework, called "Uncertainty Guided Label Denoising for Document-level Distant Relation Extraction," addresses the issue of noisy pseudo labels in distantly supervised data. These noisy labels can lead to incorrect relation extractions, such as introducing false relations or losing correct ones. 

The proposed framework uses uncertainty estimation to determine whether model predictions can be trusted or not. It introduces a method called instance-level uncertainty estimation, which captures uncertainty scores for overlapping relations. The framework also employs a re-labeling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty thresholds and a multi-phase training strategy to further improve performance. 

To model uncertainty in the pre-denoising DocRE model, the researchers used Monte Carlo dropout technology. They modified the estimation process to obtain instance-level uncertainty scores for each positive pseudo label. The framework was compared to several strong baselines on public datasets and outperformed them. The main contributions of the work include the uncertainty-guided label denoising framework, instance-level uncertainty estimation method, iterative re-label strategy, and significant performance improvements. The proposed framework has the potential to improve the accuracy of document-level distant relation extraction tasks.</sample>

The researchers proposed using large language models to rate samples based on instructions provided, aiming to overcome the drawbacks of human evaluation, such as instability and difficulty in reproducing results. 

To verify the effectiveness of large language model evaluation, the researchers conducted an experiment using four large language models (T0, InstructGPT, and ChatGPT) to rate stories generated by GPT-2 or written by humans. The models were instructed to evaluate the stories based on four attributes: grammar, coherence, likability, and relevance. The results showed that two large language models, Davinci and ChatGPT, demonstrated a clear preference for human-written text, similar to human evaluators. 

The researchers also investigated the agreement between large language models and human evaluators, the impact of instruction wording and response sampling on the results, and the benefits and costs of using large language model evaluation compared to human evaluation. The full results and discussions are presented in the paper, which can be accessed through the ACL conference.</sample>

- The task of Cross-Lingual Semantic Parsing involves translating user queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations, such as SQL and Lambda Calculus.
- Existing models have limited coverage, particularly for Chinese and Lambda calculus, and are often evaluated on a single neural model.
- XSemPLR proposes a uniform dataset with 9 datasets, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 meaning representations, and 22 natural languages.
- The benchmark considers six settings for training and evaluation, including Translate-Test, Monolingual Model, Monolingual Few-shot, Multilingual Model, Cross-lingual Zero-shot, and Cross-lingual Few-shot transfer.
- The results show that Encoder-Decoder models outperform Encoder-PTR models, and multilingual language models can be improved by training on a mixture of languages.
- The "Curse of Multilinguality" is observed, where English performance drops in seven datasets.
- XSemPLR provides a comprehensive benchmark study and shows that multilingual language models are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="263">The paper "Mitigating Label Biases for In-context Learning" addresses the instability of in-context learning in large language models due to various design choices and biases. The authors propose a systematic investigation of label bias problems, categorizing existing findings and identifying a new type of bias, domain-label bias. They also propose a novel calibration method, domain-context calibration, to handle all types of biases.

The authors conducted experiments to confirm the existence of domain-label bias, showing that seeing random in-domain words can severely bias the model's predictions, while seeing random English words does not. They found that in-context learning performs well on tasks with small domain-label bias but poorly on tasks with large domain-label bias.

The proposed domain-context calibration method uses random in-domain words to estimate the model's bias and calibrate its predictions. Experiments showed that this method significantly improves the average performance of in-context learning and outperforms previous calibration methods. The authors also conducted comprehensive calibration studies, showing that using random in-domain words leads to further improvements compared to using random English words or single pre-defined tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="264">Lin Wang, a graduate student at Zhejiang University, presented a paper titled "TAVT: Towards Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation". The paper addresses the challenge of multimodal domain shifts in audio-visual text generation tasks, where data annotation is arduous and expensive. To overcome this constraint, the authors propose a novel task called Transferable Audio-Visual Text Generation, which aims to train a model that can learn and adapt to new multimodal domains with limited labeled data.

The proposed framework consists of three components: an audio-visual meta-mapper network, an audio-visual encoder and language model generator, and counterfactual contrastive learning. The framework is modular and can be trained using a meta-learning approach. The authors also introduce a set of learnable tokens called visual prefixes for the audio cluster, which can be used to reconstruct the audio using visual content as a query.

The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art models on both cross-datasets and cross-domain settings. The authors also conducted ablation experiments to analyze the impact of audio features on the performance of the model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in transferable audio-visual text generation tasks.</sample>

They focused on evaluating translations in the other direction, specifically from English to Indian languages, as this area has been understudied. They created a dataset of 7,000 samples in five Indian languages, including Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati. Bilingual expert annotators evaluated the translations, marking errors and providing an overall score.

The study compared the performance of various evaluation metrics, including overlap-based and embedding-based metrics. They found that COMET-metric variants had the highest overall correlations for all languages. However, many metrics exhibited a skewed range of scores, making it challenging to interpret them effectively. The study also fine-tuned the best-performing metric, COMET, using their MQM dataset and observed improved correlations.

The researchers also tested the zero-shot ability of IndicCOMET on unseen languages and found that it outperformed COMET baselines in most cases. Finally, they evaluated the robustness of IndicCOMET on the ACES Translation Accuracy Challenge Sets and found that it had a higher correlation score than the COMET counterpart. The dataset and results are publicly available for use.</sample>

    <sample id="280">Shi Tao introduced his work, "MultiEMO: An Attention-Based Correlation-Aware Multimodal Fusion Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversations." The goal of emotion regulation in conversations is to predict the emotion label of each utterance in a dialogue, considering textual, audio, and visual modalities. Existing methods focus on speaker and contextual information, but have unsolved challenges, including underutilizing multimodal information and poor performance in minority emotion classes.

To address these issues, Shi Tao proposed the MultiEMO framework, consisting of four key components: unimodal feature extraction, context modeling, multimodal fusion, and emotion classification. The framework includes a novel visual feature extractor, VisExtNet, which captures facial expressions without encoding redundant scene-related information. The multimodal fusion model, MultiAttn, integrates textual, audio, and visual modalities through stacked bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers.

The third contribution is the Sample-Weighted Focal Contrastive Loss, which assigns higher importance to minority classes and maximizes inter-class distances. Experimental results on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate that MultiEMO achieves state-of-the-art performances, with significant improvements in minority and semantically similar emotions. However, the framework has limitations, including the inability to distinguish between speakers and irrelevant people in the scene, the requirement for a large batch size, and poorer performance in minority emotions compared to majority classes.</sample>
    <sample id="281">Researchers Kayo Yin and colleagues presented their work on "When Does Translation Require Context? A Data-driven, Multilingual Exploration". They aimed to answer two questions: when does translation require context, and how well do models handle these cases. 

To answer the first question, they extended a measure called CXMI to Pointwise CXMI (P-CXMI), which measures context usage at the sentence or word level. They analyzed transcripts of TED talks in 14 languages and found patterns between words with high P-CXMI. These words often require context for translation, such as dual pronouns in Arabic or proper nouns in Chinese. 

The researchers then designed a benchmark for document-level translation, called MuDA (Multilingual Discourse-Aware) tagger, to automatically identify context-dependent examples. They evaluated different models using corpus-level metrics and found that context-aware models perform best with certain metrics, but not others. Using the MuDA benchmark, they found that context-aware models are significantly more accurate for certain discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion. However, they are not better than context-agnostic models for other phenomena. Their work provides a data-driven analysis and benchmark for document-level machine translation, highlighting areas for improvement.</sample>
    <sample id="282">Our work, "StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Author-Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing," addresses the task of non-parallel text style transfer at the story level. Unlike previous studies that focused on token or sentence levels, we aim to imitate author style at the discourse level. This is challenging due to the complexity of long texts, which involve author linguistic preferences such as discourse structures, narrative techniques, and style-specific content associated with specific writing topics. Our solution is the StoryTrans generation model, which learns discourse representations from source texts and combines them with learnable style embeddings to generate texts in target styles. We designed a new training objective to reduce stylistic features from discourse representations and enhance content preservation by separating the generation into two stages. In the first stage, we transfer the source text with style-specific content keywords masked, and then generate the whole text by incorporating these keywords explicitly. Our model outperforms strong baselines in terms of style control and content preservation, as confirmed by automatic and manual evaluations. Style visualization also indicates that StoryTrans aligns with the golden text in the style feature space. Our work provides a significant step forward in non-parallel text style transfer at the story level.</sample>

    <sample id="284">Peng Tianshuo from Wuhan University presented a long paper titled "FSUIE: A Novel Fuzzy Span Mechanism for Enhancing Universal Information Extraction" at ACL's Main Conference. The current span-based UIE models rely heavily on precise span boundary annotations, which can be ambiguous. To address this, the proposed FSUIE model introduces a fuzzy span mechanism, where the span boundary is learned as a continuous distribution of correct probabilities. This is achieved through a sampling function that converts the continuous boundary distribution into discrete values for calculation of fuzzy span loss.

The model also incorporates a fuzzy span attention mechanism, which adaptively adjusts the attention span of the model. This is done through a mask function that introduces an optimizable parameter to adjust the length of the full attention range. The attention distribution on the attention span boundary linearly decays, rather than truncates.

Experiments on three main information extraction tasks, including named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction, demonstrate the effectiveness of FSUIE. The model achieves significant performance improvements compared to UIE-base, especially on small-scale data sizes. FSUIE also shows stronger generalization capabilities for domain-specific information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on several datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="285">The researchers, Mingqi Gao and team from Peking University, presented their work on "Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factual Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with Fine-grained Evaluation Framework." They aim to correct factual errors in dialogue summaries, which current models and even reference summaries often contain. The team argues that existing Factual Error Correction (FEC) models are evaluated inadequately, using overall factuality metrics like FactCC and DAE, which can be unreliable and blur the line between correction and generation.

To address this, the researchers propose a new evaluation framework that includes manually annotated reference corrections. This provides more valuable data for training FEC models and allows for a more comprehensive evaluation. They also introduce a new taxonomy of factual errors, classifying them into content-based and form-based categories. The team experiments with FEC models in different training modes and finds that training with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yields the best results. They conclude that current evaluation methods for FEC models need to be changed and that human-corrected summaries during training can improve performance.</sample>

The team developed a corpus called EPIC, which includes 300 short conversations from social media, Reddit, and Twitter, spanning 1½ years and covering five English varieties. The data was annotated by 74 people, with 15 annotators per language variety, to study the nuances of irony. 

The researchers observed differences in annotator agreement based on demographics, such as age, gender, and nationality. They developed "perspective-aware models" that take into account these differences and found that these models showed higher confidence in their predictions compared to "gold standard aggregated models." 

Further analysis revealed that annotators from adjacent generations were more likely to disagree on irony perception, and there was significant variation in responses between annotators from the United Kingdom and Ireland. The project's goal is to create more informative outputs for irony detection models, rather than simple binary labels. The findings suggest that considering individual perspectives and demographics can improve the accuracy and confidence of natural language processing models.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The project "From Dogwhistles to Bullhorns" aims to understand coded rhetoric and its impact on NLP and linguistics. Dogwhistles are terms that send a hidden message to an in-group while maintaining plausible deniability. The researchers developed a typology and glossary of over 340 terms, including racist, transphobic, and anti-Semitic dogwhistles. The glossary includes categories, explanations, and real-world examples of each dogwhistle.

A case study of historical U.S. political speeches revealed a pattern where racial dogwhistles were more frequent in speeches by Republicans since the Civil Rights era. The study also found an association between dogwhistles and conservatism over time. Experiments with language models, specifically GPT-3, showed that it can surface many dogwhistles, especially those in the formal register, but performs poorly with informal dogwhistles and transphobic dogwhistles.

The researchers also demonstrated how dogwhistles can evade content moderation by using toxicity detection with Prospective API. They found that hateful sentences rated as less toxic when standard group labels or slurs were replaced with dogwhistles. The project contributes to the understanding of dogwhistles and their impact on online discourse, highlighting the need for more effective content moderation strategies.</sample>

    <sample id="299">Michalis Korakakis and Andreas Vlachos discuss their joint work on improving the robustness of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models. Despite achieving state-of-the-art results, NLI models rely on shortcuts, which are spurious correlations between input attributes and labels. These shortcuts lead to poor performance on out-of-distribution adversarial test sets. Existing shortcut mitigation methods require domain- and dataset-specific knowledge and often assume the learner will exploit the same shortcuts as the auxiliary model.

The authors propose a minimax training method that reduces the reliance of NLI models on shortcuts. The key insight is that NLI models struggle with under-represented "hard" training instances that contradict shortcuts in dominant "easy" examples. The method computes an example weight distribution that emphasizes hard examples, encouraging the learner to prioritize learning from them. The auxiliary model maximizes the learner's loss to incentivize it to focus on ranges of the input space where it incurs high losses.

The proposed method does not assume knowledge of shortcut types and relies on the learner's own training dynamics. It is evaluated on three analytic datasets and out-of-distribution adversarial test sets, showing consistent improvements in out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="300">Interactive dictation is a task that enables users to dictate and edit documents in a natural and intuitive manner using their voice. Unlike traditional speech-to-text systems, interactive dictation allows users to issue verbal commands to edit previously dictated text, without requiring a fixed set of template commands. A new dataset and baseline system are proposed to address this task, which involves four steps: ASR recognition, segmentation, command extraction and normalization, and execution. 

A custom-designed data collection interface is introduced to collect a dataset for this task, where users can dictate and issue commands in sequence. The baseline system consists of four separate models, each trained to perform one of the four steps. The system is evaluated using exact match of the predicted end-state against the goal end-state, and the results show a trade-off between runtime and accuracy. 

The experiments demonstrate that GPT-3 models are more accurate but slower, while T5 models can improve efficiency with minimal impact on accuracy. The authors welcome further work on this task and have released code to facilitate future research. The goal is to create a more natural and intuitive interface for dictating and editing documents using voice commands.</sample>

    <sample id="305">Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University, presented a recent work on "Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning." The presentation highlighted the limitations of weakly supervised learning (WSL) methods, which rely on noisy annotations from weak labeling sources. Dawei's work addressed three research questions: 

1. Is clean validation data necessary for WSL?
2. How many clean samples are required for WSL to work properly?
3. Should clean samples be used only for validation or utilized in other ways?

The findings showed that recent WSL methods require clean validation samples to work properly, and increasing the number of clean validation samples improves performance. However, training directly on clean samples can achieve better performance than using WSL approaches. The presentation also demonstrated that the performance gain claimed by previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing for continuous fine-tuning on clean samples.

Dawei recommended several future work directions, including reporting model selection criteria, comparing WSL approaches with few-shot learning baselines, and considering continuous fine-tuning as a strong baseline for WSL. The presentation concluded by open-sourcing the code for the work.</sample>
    <sample id="306">Researchers Sebastian Schuster and Najoung Kim investigated the ability of pre-trained language models to track entity states in a discourse. They designed a task to evaluate this ability, where a model is given an initial description of box contents and must predict the contents after state-changing operations. To prevent the model from using heuristics, they implemented measures such as using abstract objects and operations. 

Their experiments showed that most models simply repeated the initial state, except for text-davinci-003, which exhibited non-trivial tracking. They found that pre-training on code was a key factor in enabling entity tracking, as GPT-3.5 models, which were trained on substantial amounts of code, performed better than other models. Smaller models like T5-base could learn to track entities with direct fine-tuning, but randomly initialized models of the same architecture failed to learn the task. The researchers note that the state tracking abilities they observed may not generalize beyond their specific setup. Their paper, available on arXiv, presents more results and analysis, including experiments with GPT-4.</sample>

    <sample id="308">Jenny, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, presented the work "NLPositionality" on characterizing design biases of datasets and models. The research highlights the concept of positionality, which refers to the perspectives people hold based on demographics, identity, and life experiences. It's a critical concept in feminist and queer academic spaces, and the researchers explored whether datasets and models have positionality.

The study used a framework called NLPositionality, which compares annotations from real users with existing datasets and models. The framework involves re-annotating datasets with diverse annotators and comparing their annotations to the models and datasets using a Pearson's R correlation score.

The research found that NLP datasets and models have positionality, with a bias towards English-speaking countries and people with a college education. For example, GPT-4 and Dynahate models were most aligned to English-speaking countries and people with a college education. However, the models were less aligned to non-binary people compared to men and women.

To address this issue, the researchers recommended keeping a record of design choices, conducting NLP research with a perspectivist lens, and building specialized datasets and models within specific communities. The study emphasizes the importance of inclusive NLP and highlights the need for more diverse and representative datasets and models.</sample>

    <sample id="317">Peng Li from Fudan University presented a paper titled "CodeIE: Large Code Generation Models are Better Few-Shot Information Extractors". The paper proposes a novel approach to information extraction, a classic task in natural language processing, by transforming it into a code generation task. The method, called CodeIE, utilizes large code language models like Codex to generate structured information from unstructured text. This approach addresses the issue of mismatched outputs between pre-training and inference stages in previous models. The authors designed code-style prompts for two common information extraction tasks: named entity recognition and relation extraction. They evaluated CodeIE on seven datasets and compared its performance with traditional text-style prompts and baseline models like T5 and GPT-3. The results showed that CodeIE significantly outperformed the baselines, especially in terms of recall, and reduced structural errors. The authors also observed that using code pre-training language models better aligns with the information extraction task itself. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of CodeIE and provides insights into the potential of code language models in information extraction tasks. The paper and code are publicly available for further research and inspiration.</sample>

    <sample id="322">Enrico presented an overview of his paper on understanding morality in text classification. He defined morality as a personal compass that distinguishes right from wrong and is essential for society. However, morality is subjective and cannot be reduced to a singular scale. 

Enrico discussed the Moral Foundation Theory, which proposes that humans perceive morality through five different foundations, prioritized differently by each individual. He mentioned that language models can somewhat understand morality in text but lacks fine-grained understanding.

To address this, Enrico and his team applied explainable AI techniques to language models trained on the Moral Foundation Twitter Corpus, a dataset of 35,000 tweets across seven domains. They aimed to understand how morality is expressed differently across domains and whether language models can recognize these differences.

Their experiments showed that language models can recognize the difference in moral expression between domains, such as All Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter. The models associated subversion with negative words in the former and somewhat positive words in the latter.

Enrico warned that using a single model for multiple domains can lead to misunderstandings of morality and emphasized the importance of understanding the nuances of moral expression in different contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="323">Yujie Wang from Shanxi University, China, proposes a novel approach called Dynamic Heterogeneous-Graph Reasoning with Language Models and Knowledge Representation Learning for Commonsense QA, titled DHLK. This method aims to improve the performance of Commonsense QA by addressing existing issues in knowledge retrieval and fusion. 

The DHLK method builds a Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph (HKG) based on multiple knowledge bases, using a two-stage pruning strategy and Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) to optimize the structure and knowledge representation of the HKG. The HKG is then encoded and fused with the language model using RoBERTa and Mask Self-Attention. 

DHLK dynamically removes entities with weaker relevance to the QA context based on attention weights. It also introduces TransE to optimize entity and relationship embeddings in HKG and Relation Mask Self-Attention (RMSA) to model subgraphs. The method incorporates HKG path information into the QA context and uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for final answer prediction.

Experiments on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA using external knowledge bases show promising results, outperforming other language models and HKG methods. The DHLK approach demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic heterogeneous-graph reasoning in Commonsense QA, with potential applications in various natural language understanding tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="327">Xiao Xu, a PhD student from Harbin Institute of Technology, presented their work "ManagerTower: Aggregating the Insights of Uni-Modal Experts for Vision-Language Representation Learning" at ACL 2023. The goal of Vision-Language learning is to train a smart AI system that can understand both images and text. Recent works can be unified as a two-tower architecture, consisting of textual, visual, and cross-modal encoders. However, current methods, such as BridgeTower, have limitations in exploiting unimodal semantic knowledge at different levels.

To address these limitations, Xiao Xu proposed ManagerTower, a novel VL modal architecture that adaptsively aggregates insights from pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels. ManagerTower introduces managers in each cross-modal layer to gather and combine insights, allowing for more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion. The architecture uses RoBERTa and CLIP-ViT base as unimodal encoders and achieves superior performances on various downstream tasks with only four million images for visual language pre-training. ManagerTower outperforms many base-size models pre-trained on more data or parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in exploiting different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge. The work provides strong evidence that adaptive managers can adaptively exploit different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge for comprehensive cross-modal representation learning.</sample>

    <sample id="329">This paper proposes a zero-shot video sentence localization method that generates structured pseudo-labels to overcome the limitations of existing methods. The task of video sentence localization involves finding the most relevant segments of a video given a natural language query. Existing methods rely on pseudo-events and pseudo-queries generated from the video, but these can be too simple and lack alignment with the real queries. The proposed method, called Structured Pseudo-Label generation, addresses these issues by first generating free-form pseudo-queries using a pre-trained image caption model and then generating pseudo-events based on the event temporal structure. To reduce the influence of label noise, the method uses sample re-weighting and label refinement. The pseudo-labels are generated by densely sampling video frames and using the BLIP model to generate pseudo-queries. The pseudo-events are then generated based on the event temporal structure, requiring high relevance between videos within the events and queries, and low relevance between videos outside the events and query. The proposed method outperforms existing methods on two datasets, ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA, achieving the best zero-shot performance. The code is available for further research and development.</sample>

    <sample id="333">Researchers from Nanjing University propose a novel framework, INK, to enhance neural machine translation (NMT) models' generalization and performance. The existing kNN-MT approach, which smooths predictions according to nearest neighbors in the representation space, is time-consuming and has limited flexibility. To address these drawbacks, INK injects kNN knowledge into the NMT model through a training loop that iteratively refines the representation space. 

The INK framework consists of two steps: first, kNN knowledge is extracted from a datastore to guide an adapter to adjust the representation; then, updated representations are used to refresh the datastore asynchronously. The adapter is optimized with a combined learning objective, and the training loop runs until convergence. The datastore can be dropped aside after training.

Experiments on the WMT'19 German-English news translation task show that INK outperforms the state-of-the-art kNN-MT system and achieves the best performance after smoothing the representation space. The INK system achieves an average gain of 1.99 COMET score and 1.0 BLEU score compared to kNN-MT systems, with less memory space and faster inference speed.</sample>

    <sample id="337">The research "Graph-based Relation Mining for Context-free Out-of-vocabulary Word Embedding Learning" focuses on addressing the issue of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in embedding-based models. OOV words are challenging to represent and are critical to model performance. To handle OOV words, the researchers propose a new approach that leverages word formation and association. They introduce a Word Relationship Graph that imitates lexical rules and associates OOV words with relevant words. The graph consists of two layers: the first layer preserves all wordpiece information, while the second layer samples a fixed number of nodes to mitigate noise.

To process the graph, the researchers employ a graph neural network, self-attention network, and two levels of Graph Attention Network. They also incorporate a readout block layer to capture graph information and summarize word formation. To mimic the vector space of the background embedding model, they apply contrastive learning in the loss function. The model is evaluated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks. The researchers also discuss the potential of adding languages to the model, highlighting the challenges and opportunities presented by agglutinative and fusional languages.</sample>
    <sample id="338">The researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Northeastern University, and IBM Research presented a study on evaluating human natural language explanations. They addressed the question of how to assess the quality of human-annotated explanations, which can be subjective and task-dependent. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE focus on word similarity, while the simulatability score measures the baseline performance change with explanations presented or absent. However, these metrics neglect task differences and the utility of explanations during fine-tuning and inference stages.

The researchers introduced a unified data format and conducted experiments on five large-scale datasets, including CoS-E, ECQA, e-SNLI, and ComVE. They found that fine-tuning models with explanations does not teach new knowledge, but rather teaches the model to rely on explanations to predict. They proposed a novel evaluation metric, TREU, which extends the simulatability score to evaluate the helpfulness of explanations at fine-tuning. The TREU score consistently ranks dataset qualities across two models, T5 and BART, and outperforms the simulatability score in evaluating human explanations. The study emphasizes the importance of high-quality human collaboration in annotation jobs and recommends researchers perform similar quality checks in the future.</sample>

    <sample id="340">Kuan-Hao Huang from UCLA presented a joint work titled "ParaAMR: A Large-Scale Syntactically Diverse Paraphrase Dataset by AMR Back-Translation." The team aimed to address the limitation of existing paraphrase datasets, which are either of high quality but limited in scale or large in scale but lack syntactic diversity. They proposed using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR) to generate paraphrases through back-translation. 

The process involves converting a source sentence into an AMR graph, modifying the graph by changing the focus node and edge labels, and then generating text from the modified graph. This approach yields paraphrases with similar semantics but different syntax. The resulting dataset, ParaAMR, contains around 15 million source sentences with 6.9 paraphrases per sentence. 

The team demonstrated that ParaAMR outperforms existing datasets in terms of syntactic diversity while maintaining similar semantic similarity scores. They applied ParaAMR to various NLP tasks, including sentence embeddings, syntactic control paraphrase generation, and few-shot learning, achieving better results in each case. The dataset is available for public access.</sample>

The existing large-scale dialogue datasets are mostly text-sourced, which does not accurately represent real spoken conversations. To address this, the authors propose LiveChat, a Chinese video-sourced and personalized dialogue dataset constructed from live streaming videos on Douyin (Chinese TikTok). 

The dataset is built through three steps: extracting audio from videos, transcribing audio into utterances, and collecting audience comments to construct dialogues. Persona information is also collected for personalized dialogue generation. The dataset is compared to existing open-domain dialogue datasets, showing that LiveChat has a larger scale, is video-sourced, and has longer average sessions.

Experiments are conducted on two benchmark tasks: Response Modeling and Addressee Recognition. The results show that extracted persona and longer average sessions are beneficial to the final result. Additionally, the performance of pre-trained dialogue models on LiveChat is investigated, and the results confirm that the domain of LiveChat is distinct from existing dialogue datasets. The authors plan to focus on efficient transfer learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) for LiveChat in the future.</sample>

    <sample id="345">This paper presents a novel approach to compositional generalization in semantic parsing without relying on trees. Compositional generalization enables models to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases seen individually during training. Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models struggle with this task, often producing detached outputs. To address this, the authors introduce a neural seq2seq model that directly models correspondences between input and output fragments. The model predicts the output in two steps: first, tagging each input token with an unordered multiset of output tokens, and second, predicting a permutation to order the tokens. The permutation model is flexible and expressive, predicting the order of tokens by jumping between multiset tokens. The authors address challenges such as alignment between input and output, latent permutations, and the NP-hard permutation problem with a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation. Experimental results on the COGS benchmark show that the proposed method outperforms other treeless models by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion. The paper presents a solution to compositional generalization without trees, offering a more flexible and expressive approach to semantic parsing.</sample>

    <sample id="348">This research, "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models," addresses the limitations of existing methods for detecting social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a novel approach that leverages the ability of instruction-tuned LLMs to respond to prompts. By asking the model to generate personas based on specific demographic characteristics, the researchers can identify subtle patterns of stereotyping. The method has two parts: persona generation and marked words analysis. The latter uses the sociolinguistic concept of "markedness" to identify words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones. The results show that the generated personas contain a high rate of positive stereotypes, but these words facilitate essentializing narratives and contribute to discrimination and othering. The analysis reveals common tropes and patterns, particularly for women of color, which reflect long histories of marginalization. The study concludes with three recommendations for model owners: addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives, using an intersectional lens to study biases, and increasing transparency about bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The paper "What's the Meaning of Superhuman Performance in Today's NLU" by Simone Tedeschi and colleagues investigates the reliability of leaderboard scores in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks. The authors argue that achieving human-level or superhuman performance in popular benchmarks, such as SuperGLUE and SQuAD, does not necessarily mean that systems have truly surpassed human capabilities. They highlight several issues with the current evaluation methods, including:

* Systems and humans are often evaluated on different sets, making comparisons unfair.
* Errors in ground-truth answers can lead to inaccurate evaluations.
* Human performance is often estimated vaguely, and the term "human baseline" can be misleading.
* Pay rates for human annotators vary greatly across tasks, and low pay can result in low-quality annotations.
* Details about the annotator pool, such as their cultural background and hiring process, are often omitted.

The authors conclude that claims of superhuman performance are not yet scientifically meaningful due to these issues. They recommend constructing more reliable benchmarks by ensuring that systems and humans are evaluated on the same data, providing accurate ground-truth answers, and transparently reporting human performance and annotator details. The paper provides a critical examination of the current state of NLU evaluation and offers recommendations for improving the field.</sample>
    <sample id="351">This paper, titled "Do CoNLL-2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023?", investigates the generalization of named entity recognition (NER) models developed using the CoNLL-2003 dataset, which has been used for nearly 20 years. The researchers developed the CoNLL++ dataset, a new annotated dataset collected from Reuters News in 2020, to evaluate the performance of over 20 models fine-tuned on CoNLL-2003. They found that three key ingredients are necessary for good generalization: a suitable model architecture (preferably transformer-based), a large model size, and sufficient fine-tuning examples. In contrast, the performance drop of some models is caused by temporal drift, rather than adaptive overfitting. The study confirms that CoNLL-2003 taggers can still work well in 2023, but highlights the need for more research on improving model generalization. The researchers hope that their findings will encourage further investigation into strategies for enhancing model robustness and adaptability to new data.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" addresses the challenge of input underspecification in code generation and program synthesis. The authors propose interactivity through asking clarification questions to gather more specifications and alleviate the problem. They introduce CodeClarQA, a synthetic dataset with clarifications on key operations, and a pipeline for code generation by asking clarification questions.

The pipeline consists of a Clarification Need Predictor, a Question Selector, and a Code Generator. The authors also propose a method to create CodeClarQA, which involves identifying key operations and corresponding documentation from the code, representing them in latent space, and computing similarity scores between an NLD and the operation documentation.

The authors test their pipeline and find that model performances increase with more high-ranked CQs being answered and included. However, the pipeline still underperforms the model-only trainer NLDs and code. They analyze the results and find that clarified key operations are the reason for better generated code. The authors conclude that their task is challenging, but their method shows promise in addressing the challenge of input underspecification in code generation.</sample>

    <sample id="361">Armineh Nourbakhsh, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and research director at JP Morgan AI Research, presented a work titled "CounterComp" that focuses on improving compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning using counterfactual scenarios. The goal is to enable a model to ask different questions about a financial table, such as "What was the net change in revenue from 2019 to 2020?" and derive the answer by executing one or more arithmetic operations. However, state-of-the-art neural models struggle with this task, especially when the output includes multiple steps, as they memorize spurious patterns.

To address this challenge, the authors propose using counterfactual scenarios to mine positive and negative examples from the training set. They add an auxiliary metric learning loss to the training procedure, which has a dynamic margin that measures the extent of change in the questions between each pair. This approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, especially when the number of reasoning steps grows beyond two. The authors also show that adding the CounterComp loss improves performance on out-of-distribution samples and helps the model attend to more meaningful tokens during training. The work aims to enable a model to generalize compositional reasoning to unseen data.</sample>
