    <sample id="2">The presentation by Tiwei from EdGroup introduces a paper on document understanding, focusing on the visually rich document understanding problem. The paper addresses the limitations of existing document pre-training models, which often suffer from reading order issues due to global 1D positional assumptions. The proposed solution, LayoutMask, uses local 1D positional information and two novel masking strategies to enhance text-layout interactions. The Mask Language Modeling task is adapted to set masks at the word level, promoting context prediction. The Mask Position Modeling task, similar to Cloze Test, requires the model to predict masked 2D positions, encouraging spatial inference. Experiments show LayoutMask outperforms global 1D positional models on SROIE but lags behind on COCO, with the performance gap attributed to entity total. The paper concludes that global 1D positional assumptions are more adaptive in certain cases.</sample>

    <sample id="6">The presentation by Jian Zhang and colleagues introduces a novel approach to multilingual and cross-lingual summarization, termed many-to-many summarization. This method aims to unify previous models into a more general framework, allowing for document summarization in any source language and generating summaries in any target language. The team conducted preliminary studies to analyze the differences between multilingual, cross-lingual, and many-to-many summarization, finding that many-to-many summarization could better transfer task knowledge across languages. They proposed a model called PACE, which is trained through a three-stage process: mental pre-training, cross-lingual pre-training, and task-specific pre-training. The results from experiments on the WNLI dataset showed that PACE outperformed existing models like MBERT50 and MT5. The team also conducted human studies to validate the effectiveness of their model, encouraging further exploration through their paper.</sample>

The method addresses issues of internal information overutilization and external information underexploitation by proposing a graph information bottleneck guided feature refinement.

The method also enriches CMG with multimodal topic information, integrating it with attention operations. Experiments on the WDI dataset show that leveraging visual features can enhance performance, with internal information screening and external information exploiting being crucial depending on the input's text and visual relevance.

    <sample id="32">Hi, my name is Matthias Landmann, and today I'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations. This is joint work with my advisors Alexander Koller and Ivan Tiedoff. Compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training. In the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this. As usual, we have a training set of utterances. In this case, the girl slept, and Mary knew that the girl slept. These utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning. In contrast to standard machine learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms. In this example, the model has seen shallow recursion during training and is tested on examples with deeper recursion. Naive sequence to sequence models struggle with this kind of out-of-distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input. In particular, they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output, such as those that are color coded in the example. A popular method to address this is to integrate trees into the models. The trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with the logical forms. This works well, but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow. This can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process. Typically, this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms, for example, to handle variable symbols. Obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures. In this paper, we don't use trees and introduce a neural sequence to sequence model that directly models the correspondences between fragments of the input and fragments of the output. For the first step, we tag each input token with an unordered multi-set of tokens that will appear in the output. After the first step, we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered. That's why in the second step, we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order. We introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations. This makes our approach quite flexible and expressive. Conceptually, our permutation model works roughly like this. We go from left to right over the output and determine which multi-set token to put in every position. For the first output position, we simply select one as highlighted in red. Then we jump to the next multi-set token to determine the second token in the output. We determine the third token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multi-set token. We continue this process until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once. To give you a teaser of the experimental results, here we compare our method with other tree-less models on the cogs benchmark. Our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion. Some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging though. In our paper, we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges. First of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data. As a consequence, for a given token, we don't know which multi-set it came from, which poses a challenge for training. In addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data, but the linguistically correct one is latent. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training. Our permutation method is very flexible, but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is NP hard. That's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem. We approximate this with a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations. If you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges, please have a look at our paper or come to our poster.</sample>

    <sample id="35">Hello, I am Dawei, a PhD student at Saarland University in Germany. In this video, I would like to present our recent work, Weakly Supervised Learning: A Critical Look. This is joint work with Xiaoxuan, Mario Smusbach, Giasdelfen, and Dittlich Klako. I would like to begin with a brief introduction to weak supervision and weakly supervised learning. In weak supervision, we do not manually label the data. Instead, we label the data using weak labeling sources, such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low quality crowdsourcing, as illustrated in the figure on the right. When compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect. If we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize. In weakly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such labeled noise so that the trained models still generalize well. In recent works in WSL, so WSL stands for weakly supervised learning, a common claim is that people say that they only train models on weakly labeled data and achieve high performance on clean test sets. Technically, this claim is not wrong, but there is a catch, which is that people do assume that there is an additional clean validation set available for model selection. We cast doubt on this problem setting, as this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weakly supervised learning. But like an elephant in the room, this necessity is often overlooked. The aforementioned assumption is to ask three research questions. First, is clean validation data necessary for WSL? Or can we maybe use a noisy validation set instead? Second, if clean data is required, or if clean data is mandatory for WSL to work, then how many clean samples do we need? Finally, should we only use the clean samples for validation, or are there better ways to utilize them? We addressed these research questions in our work, and our findings are as follows. First, we find that interestingly, recent WSL methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly. Otherwise, there is a large performance drop. As shown in this figure, if there are no clean validation samples, then the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels, meaning that the training is pointless. This indicates that WSL approaches actually require clean labeled data to work properly, and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked. Our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left. Typically, we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance. But that's not the end of the story, because if we either way decide to access clean samples, then training on them directly will achieve better performance. The right figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches, which are directly applied on the clean data, and WSL approaches, which use the clean data for validation only. As we can see from the figures, if we have 10 samples per class, direct fine-tuning starts to beat WSL approaches. Finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples. As we can see from the figures, the Valina model, termed Ftw, initially underperforms more complicated WSL methods like CoSine. However, if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples, then Ftw performs equally well as other methods. So in practice, there is no reason to choose more complex WSL methods, which require more computation time and disk space. To summarize, we showed that recent WSL approaches require clean, manually annotated samples for them to work properly. Their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated. Our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows. First, report the model selection criteria. For example, report if the model selection is done well clean validation samples. Second, WSL approaches should be compared to few-shot learning baselines, as both work on clean samples. Third, continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL. Finally, we have open sourced our code. You can find it via the QR code on this slide. Please feel free to check it out. Thank you, and enjoy the conference.</sample>
    <sample id="36">The talk introduces language-specific layers (LSLs) for multilingual machine translation, aiming to enhance capacity per language while maintaining inference costs. The approach involves a regular transformer layer per language, which selects the correct sublayer during training and inference, thus keeping costs constant. LSLs are primarily placed in the encoder, as placing them in the decoder did not yield significant improvements. The model is trained with three weights per encoder layer: shared, source, and target, and the best placement is learned by identifying the layer with the largest weight. Experiments on the WMT21 dataset show that the learned architecture significantly improves translation quality across all languages, especially for low-resource languages, with statistically significant results in 84 out of 9 translation directions.</sample>

Cognitive dissonance, defined as inconsistent beliefs or actions, is crucial for understanding decision-making and mental health. Despite its importance, dissonance is rarely expressed in language, making it a challenging area of study. Vasudha's team used a large-scale annotation of discourse units to identify dissonance, but initial results showed poor performance due to the rarity of dissonance. To address this, they employed transfer learning and active learning, transferring weights from related tasks to improve dissonance detection. They found that the proposed probability of rare class (PRC) strategy was effective for acquiring rare class examples, though annotators found the examples difficult. The research concluded that PRC is a simple yet effective strategy for rare class acquisition, and transfer learning with appropriate tasks can significantly aid in dissonance detection.</sample>

It describes neural network architectures, such as second-to-second models and large language models (LLMs), which have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, LLMs face challenges like poor performance in mathematical reasoning and generalization issues. The paper suggests augmenting LLMs with tools and creating datasets in multiple languages to improve performance.

    <sample id="67">The discussion focuses on interference in multilingual translation models, where interference can occur when small models are trained on large datasets. Key factors include model size, data size, language similarity, and the total number of languages. Experiments show that language similarity has minimal impact on interference, while model and data size significantly affect performance. Severe interference occurs in small models, but can be mitigated by increasing data size and tuning the sampling temperature. Temperature sampling allows models to better handle low-resource languages, with a common value of 5 being effective. The study concludes that tuning temperature and scaling data size are crucial for reducing interference, without needing specialized algorithms.</sample>

DenseAtomic is constructed by normalizing tail events, training a relation prediction model, and inferring missing links. The process involves using a new method called RSKGC, which predicts relations between head and tail events without relying on graph structure, thus overcoming the sparsity issue. The paper demonstrates that DenseAtomic achieves higher knowledge coverage and more diverse multi-hop paths, leading to better performance in commonsense reasoning. The evaluation shows that DenseAtomic outperforms other methods, including RSKGC and translation-based methods, in both automatic and human evaluations. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of DenseAtomic for improving machine-human interaction through enhanced commonsense reasoning.</sample>

The framework includes a Heuristic Assays Ranking (HER) module to generate partial order pairs from multiple quality signals and a Deep Pairwise Rank Aggregation (DPR) module to aggregate these pairs into a unified supervision. The DPR module addresses conflicts among different signals through a deep pairwise rank aggregation loss, which assigns confidence weights to each signal. Experiments demonstrate that LRA outperforms other unsupervised baselines and achieves competitive performance with supervised methods. The study highlights the potential of LRA in both scientific research and practical applications, offering a more efficient and robust approach to AES.</sample>

    <sample id="90">The paper by Hana Liu and colleagues explores the potential of using language learners as data annotators in NLP, challenging the traditional reliance on native speakers. The study involved English, Korean, and Indonesian languages, focusing on four tasks from the GLUE benchmark. Learners were categorized into three proficiency levels and compared to native speakers. The experiments showed that learners could achieve nearly as accurate annotations as native speakers, especially for simpler tasks. Aggregating learners' labels with majority voting improved model performance, sometimes even surpassing native speaker annotations. The study also demonstrated that learners' language proficiency improved with annotation tasks. This research suggests a new method for data construction in low-resource languages, overcoming geographic and technological barriers.</sample>

    <sample id="100">The talk discusses a method for multi-hop question answering (QA) that requires reasoning across multiple documents. The method, Prompt-Rank, uses unsupervised retrieval combined with a few-shot language model reranker to efficiently handle questions with limited data. It involves retrieving candidate chains using TF-IDF and hyperlink traversal, then scoring them with a language model. The scoring function is the likelihood of the question given the chain prompt, and the instruction plays a crucial role in eliciting the language model's reasoning. Prompt-Rank outperforms fully supervised systems like DrKIT and performs comparably to state-of-the-art multi-hop retrievers. Ablation studies show the importance of each component in the system's performance. The downstream QA performance, when using Prompt-Rank as a retriever, is strong, with the system underperforming only slightly against the M-D-R model. The talk concludes with the effectiveness of using language models for few-shot path retrieval in multi-hop QA.</sample>

    <sample id="113">Hello, I'm James Finch. And I'm Sarah Finch. And today, we'll tell you all about ABC Eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI. This work was done by the Emery NLP lab, led by Professor Gino Choi at Emery University, and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art. The common practice is to use human evaluation, such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a Likert scale. These approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality. However, dialogue quality has many aspects. Therefore, you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level. One approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality, such as the relevance of model responses, using existing comparative or Likert scale methods. However, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation. Our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself. We call this approach annotating behaviors in chat, or ABC Eval, in short. We developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature. ABC Eval is capable of measuring the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors. For example, ABC Eval measures the number of turns in which a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant, contradicts itself or its partner, hallucinates incorrect facts or violates common sense knowledge, and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy. To determine what kind of evaluation is most effective, we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human-bot conversations per model using ABC Eval. For comparison, we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods: Likert ratings on the turn level, Likert ratings on the dialogue level, and dialogue level pairwise comparisons. For each of the existing methods, we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue. Since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions.</sample>

The speaker demonstrated that their method achieves up to 90% parameter compression and improved performance on tasks like machine translation, language modeling, and abstract summarization. They also highlighted the potential for future work in task-specific pruning, which could further optimize model efficiency.</sample>

The speaker proposes using residual connections from intermediate layers to enhance switch point information in the final layer and introduces an auxiliary loss to encourage the model to learn more language information.

Their study uses the OFA model, which employs a unified vocabulary for language, images, and bounding boxes, to perform tasks in a sequence-to-sequence format. They conduct experiments with 53 training tasks and 10,000 instances per task, and test with the entire common sense reasoning group. The results show that instruction tuning significantly improves OFA's performance on unseen multi-modal tasks, with transfer learning from natural instruction datasets enhancing the model's sensitivity and performance. They also introduce a new metric called sensitivity, which measures the model's ability to produce consistent outputs for the same task.

The research evaluates LLMs using three QA settings: closed book, open book, and reasoned QA. The study proposes a training strategy with temporal span extraction pre-training and time-sensitive reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' temporal reasoning. The TempT5 model, a combination of T5 and TempT5, shows improved performance over other models, particularly in open book and reasoned QA settings.

    <sample id="134">Hi, I am Janis Lavraque and I will present our work on Dr. Bert, a robust pre-trained model in French for biomedical and clinical domain. In this presentation, we first talk about language modeling in healthcare. Then we present the main contribution of our article. We introduce the first biomedical model in French, named Dr. Bert, which is based on Roberta and trained on Natus, which is a dataset of medical crawled data from the web. We also introduce a comparison of model with multiple pre-training settings and data sources. Then we present our results on 11 biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in French. Finally, we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access the models. Since its release in 2018, Bert has become one of the most effective approaches to solve natural language processing tasks and offer huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as Word2Vec, FastText, or NLTK. However, since then, this model has been adapted to many other languages, like in French with Camembert, and other domains like biomedical with Permitted Bert and Bio-Bert, and on clinical with Clinical Bert, but mostly in English. Specialized models for other languages are scarce and are often based on continuous pre-training due to the lack of in-domain data. However, French did not have any open source model for biomedical until now. So we ask ourselves question about what is the most appropriate data sources for a wide range of usage, and those crowd data are good substitution for clinical data. To answer this question, we compare Dr. Bert with our Shubert model, which is a clinical model with four gigabytes of sentences taken from clinical notes. In addition to this comparison, we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy. One based on the weight of Camembert and trained on four gigabytes of Natus, another also based on Camembert but trained on the four gigabytes of clinical notes, and finally one based on English biomedical model, Permitted Bert, and trained on four gigabytes of Natus. In total, we have seven models. To evaluate our seven models, we gather each public and private downstream tasks such as name entity recognition, classification, part of speech tagging, and question answering. This model are compared to six baseline models which are Camembert, Oscar, 1.38 gigabytes, Camembert, Oscar, 4 gigabytes, Camembert, Ccnet, 4 gigabytes, Permitted Bert, Bio-Bert, and Clinical Bert. The evaluation highlights that model perform best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained. However, we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile. We also observe that using more data translate to better performance. In overall, from scratch training seem to obtain higher performance on most of the task. However, our experiment on consumer pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of Permitted Bert trained on the four gigabytes of Natus show comparable results to those obtained with Dr. Bert four gigabytes from scratch, which is not the case for the model based on Camembert weights and tokenizer, which suffer from stability issues. Finally, as a conclusion, our proposed system offer better performance on nine of the eleven downstream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here, Camembert. We also observe that specialized data is better, more specialized data is better, but it doesn't scale well. All the pre-trained models obtained from Natus are freely available and on Hugging Face, and all the training scripts are on our GitHub repository. So thank you for this presentation, and we are looking forward to exchange at the poster session in Toronto.</sample>
    <sample id="135">James and Sarah Finch introduce ABC Eval, a new method for evaluating conversational AI developed by the Emory NLP Lab in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. This method aims to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluations by annotating specific behaviors in AI responses, such as relevance, contradictions, and empathy. They tested ABC Eval on 100 conversations per model, comparing it to traditional methods like Lickert ratings. Their findings show that ABC Eval is more reliable and predictive of overall conversation quality, explaining over 25% of the quality compared to the 4% explained by Lickert ratings. The method identifies unique aspects of chat quality and quantifies common errors in AI models, such as self-contradictions and irrelevant information. The Finches hope ABC Eval will be a valuable tool for the AI community to improve model evaluations.</sample>

    <sample id="156">Hello everyone, my name is Aydil Bilard and I will be giving a short overview of the paper, prompting PAMP from translation, assessing strategies and performance. This is joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate. PAMP is a 540 billion parameters large language model presented last year in 2022. It's trained on a large collection of text comprising 780 billion tokens. At the time of publication, it achieves state of the art in hundreds of NLP tasks. In this work, we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation. We evaluate the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the AMT community. We compare two state-of-the-art systems, so the best performing systems are the WMT evaluation. We use state-of-the-art neural MT metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies. The prompting has a big influence on the performance of the LLMs for translation. As we can see in a simple experiment where we use one shot prompting and provided two different prompts for each sentence. The majority of sentences, 516 out of 1000, the difference observed is of more than one blur points. And this can go in extreme cases up to 40 blur points. So it's important to select a good prompting strategy. In our experiments, we settled for a five shot prompting strategy where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in. So in this example here where we perform translation from German into English, the German sentences, the source sentences are marked with German colon and the English translations with English colon. We saw that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have a big influence in the case of zero and one shot prompting. It's crucial for zero and one shot prompting, but when we go as in our case to five shot prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the prompting. It's crucial for example quality than the similarity to the source sentence. So it's important to select the examples from high quality translations. In particular, we compare selecting prompts from the training data of the WMT evaluations or the dev data. The dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data that it's more noisy and the results show a better performance when using the dev data. Nevertheless, specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the PAMP translation, but PAMP comes pretty close to a commercial system. In our case, we chose to evaluate with Google Translate. The insights that we gain from the human evaluation that we perform using the NPM framework is that the fluency of PAMP is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but the main difference comes from the accuracy. So in particular, the most common error are omission errors. So it seems that PAMP chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are made in the translation. However, the style awkward category for PAMP is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems, which is an additional signal that PAMP provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy. And that's it for this really short overview. For more details, please come by the full presentation of the paper. Thank you very much.</sample>
    <sample id="157">Sheng Gao from Sun Dong University presents a work on dialogue summarization using a static dynamic structure fusion graph. The project, a collaboration with several colleagues, aims to distill silent information from dialogues into concise summaries. Traditional methods using precomputed static graphs face challenges like dependency on external tools and inflexibility. Gao's approach introduces a four-component model: encoding utterances into vectors, constructing static graphs, combining them with dynamic graphs using a multi-head attention model, and fusing them with a pre-trained language model. The method captures speaker interactions and positions through advanced metrics, integrating them into a unified graph representation. This approach allows for dynamic adaptation to dialogue summarization tasks, overcoming the limitations of static graph models. The project is detailed in a paper available on GitHub.</sample>
    <sample id="158">The speaker, Xiangkunhu from AWS, introduces Dual Cache, a method for improving coreference resolution in long documents. Coreference resolution involves linking mentions of the same entity across a text. Traditional cache-based methods use a fixed-size cache, reducing complexity to linear levels, but struggle with long documents due to frequent topic switches. Dual Cache addresses this by using a local cache with an LRU eviction policy and a global cache with an LFU policy, allowing for better handling of both local and global entities. The model scans documents, classifies new mentions, and evaluates their frequency, adding them to the appropriate cache. Benchmarks show Dual Cache outperforms single cache methods, especially in long documents, and significantly reduces cache misses. Despite trade-offs in model efficiency, Dual Cache offers the highest performance/cost ratio.</sample>

    <sample id="166">Yuxin from Harbin University of Technology presented a new method for image retrieval from linguistically complex texts, addressing the limitations of existing visual language models. The method employs a divide and conquer strategy, inspired by dual-process theory, to break down complex reasoning into simpler tasks. It integrates a visual linguistic system for analogical reasoning and a logical system for complex reasoning. The method includes a proposition generator, a decoder, a visual linguistic system, and a neural symbolic reasoner. The neural symbolic reasoner integrates reasoning states and results to solve complex problems. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental results, showing superior performance over baseline models. Yuxin suggests that neural symbolic calculation and divide and conquer strategies can improve reasoning and planning in large language models.</sample>

The study evaluates the translation capabilities of PAMP using the latest test sets and compares it to state-of-the-art systems. It highlights the significant impact of prompt selection on translation quality, with experiments showing that five-shot prompting yields better results than one-shot or zero-shot. The study emphasizes the importance of using high-quality, human-annotated data for prompts, as it leads to better performance compared to noisy training data. While PAMP's fluency is comparable to advanced systems, it struggles with accuracy, often omitting parts of the source sentence. The study concludes that PAMP is a strong contender for commercial use, despite its accuracy issues.</sample>

    <sample id="173">Hello everyone, my name is Shu-Hung. Today, I am going to present our paper, Do Conner 2003 Named Entity Taggers Still Work Well in 2023? Let's get started. Our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the NER task. We observed that models have been using Conner 2003 to develop NER for almost 20 years. This naturally raises several problems. Firstly, can these models generalize to modern data? And when we do observe poor generalization, what causes the performance drop of these models? To investigate these problems, we developed the Conner++ dataset. This is a dataset that we collected from Reuters News from 2020 and then annotated with the same Conner 2003 annotation guidelines. We then fine-tuned over 20 models on Conner 2003, evaluated them on both the Conner 2003 test set and the Conner++ test set, and last but not least, calculated the percentage change in F1 to assess the generalization of each model. So, what is needed for good generalization? Through our experiments, we found that there are three main ingredients that are needed. The first one is the model architecture. Through our experiments, we found that the transformer models normally generalize better to new data. The second ingredient is the model size. We found that usually larger models lead to better generalization. And last but not least, we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task. Here, we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually lead to better generalization. To our next question, what causes the performance drop of some models? We had two hypotheses. The first one is adaptive overfitting, which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again. And this is usually manifested as the diminishing returns on a new test set. The second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation that is caused by the increasing temporal gap between the train and the test data. For adaptive overfitting, we saw that from the graph on the right, the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than 1. This means that every unit of improvement that we made on Conner 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on Conner++, which means that there is no diminishing returns. And this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed. So, what about temporal drift then? For temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data. And we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap. And this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift. Our conclusion is that for good generalization, we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine-tuning examples. And these go hand in hand. We can't just have one ingredient, but throw all the others. At the same time, we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift, and kind of surprisingly, it is not caused by adaptive overfitting, even though Conner 2003 has been used for over 20 years. So, going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper, do Conner 2003 taggers still work in 2023? And we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes. We hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalizations of the models. And lastly, please make sure to check out our paper, our dataset, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Thank you so much.</sample>

    <sample id="186">Hi, I'm Myra, and today I'll be talking about our paper, Marked Personas, using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models. This work is done in collaboration with Eszter Mosh and Dan Jurafsky. In recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models, or LLMs. However, these measures have various limitations. They usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate, and they usually only measure very specific stereotypes, meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts, or they simply capture very general broad associations, like negative associations with particular groups. Furthermore, most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality, which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm. To overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned LLMs are very good at responding to instructions and prompts. So we can ask the model to generate a persona, which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt to like, imagine you are an Asian woman, describe yourself. And we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt. So here are some example generations from GPT-4. Immediately, we see that while the outputs aren't overtly negative or toxic in the traditional sense of these words, there are some interesting patterns. The Asian woman is depicted as unassuming, the Middle Eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic, and like referring to a mesmerizing region, and both of the women of color personas make references to ancestry, while the white man persona has nothing of the sort. To capture these patterns, our method has two parts. The first one is generating these personas. Our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects, finding that by giving it to human subjects, they also were able to surface racial stereotypes. And also, this enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human-written responses. The second part is marked words, which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, which I'll elaborate on shortly. The benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon. So the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness, which states that there is an unmarked default, and any group that deviates from that default is linguistically marked. So for instance, the word warrior is usually associated with men. So when people are describing a warrior who is a woman, they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman. And more broadly, dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked, while the marginalized groups are usually marked. So in our method, we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are. And then we compare the personas using the fighting words method, which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group. So for instance, for the personas of black women, we would do fighting words and compare the log odds ratios against both white personas and man personas, because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups. Now for some results. So first, we use a lexicon of stereotypes, and we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human-written ones. However, when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon, we find very different things. So while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words, the human-written ones have a much wider distribution of words, while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic. So really just the positive or at least non-negative ones. And in fact, this lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides while at all. So instead to do that, we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these seemingly positive words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives. In our analysis, we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns. First, for mark groups, the top words include things like culture, tradition, proud, and exotic. And these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm. This contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups. Furthermore, there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color. So for example, the words describing Latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous, which connects to a trope of tropicalism. For Asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky, which connects to a long history of Asian women being hypersexualized, seen as very docile and submissive, and so on. And finally, for black women, we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient. This connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype. And while it sounds like positive at first glance, there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles, which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people, among other harms. More broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives. So based on these patterns, we conclude with three recommendations for model owners. First, we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives. We should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that. And finally, there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods, because for instance, like these positive stereotypes, we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on, or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns. We just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency. Thank you so much for listening. Have a good time at ACL.</sample>

    <sample id="205">Xiangbing, a PhD student at the University of Washington, presented research on the influence of political biases in language models, which are trained on large-scale web data. The research highlights that while these models can learn from diverse perspectives, they may also inherit social biases from politically skewed pre-training data, leading to fairness issues in downstream applications. The study proposes evaluating political leanings of language models using political questionnaires and conducting experiments to understand how biases are transferred from training data. Preliminary results show that models like GPT-4 lean more liberal, and models trained on different corpora exhibit varying political biases. The research also explores the impact of these biases on applications like hate speech and fake news detection, revealing that models with different political leanings perform differently across demographics. The discussion emphasizes the dilemma of sanitizing political opinions in training data without risking censorship, likening it to the 'electric trolley problem.'

    <sample id="215">Adam Szarkowski's talk focuses on the dependency structure of coordination in linguistics, contrasting symmetric and asymmetric approaches. Symmetric structures, like those in Universal Dependencies and the Prague approach, select one conjunct as the head, while asymmetric structures, such as those in Dependency Treebanks, have the conjunction as the head. Szarkowski argues for symmetric structures, using the principle of dependency length minimization. He provides examples where direct objects are closer to the verb, and adjunctions are further away, but this can be mitigated if the direct object is long. His analysis, based on data from the Penn Treebank, shows that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, especially when the governor is absent. This supports the argument against asymmetric structures, as the tendency for shorter conjuncts is stronger when the governor is on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="216">Hi, I'm Sara Papi from the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler, and I will briefly introduce the Attention as a Guide for Simultaneous Speech Translation paper. This is a joint work with Matteo Negri and Marco Turilli. What is simultaneous speech translation? Simultaneous speech translation, or ST, is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time, enabling cross-language communication. What are the problems of the current ST models? Specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized, long and complicated training procedures, for example, training involving different optimization objectives, and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes, for example, training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency, and so on. So what is our solution? First, to use already existing offline ST models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for ST, use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific parameters, and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the cross-attention mechanism, that is, the cross-attention mechanism. You can see an example on the right. Our solution is to propose a dot, or encoder-decoder attention. It is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to. A word is emitted if the attention is not concentrated, that is, the sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames, meaning the received information is not stable. For example, if we receive a speech chunk containing I'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in German, and we will look at the cross-attention weights, we will see that the first two words points to the earliest received speech frames, while the last word points to the last received speech frames as lambda speech frames. This means that the first two words will be emitted, while since the sum of the cross-attention is above a certain threshold alpha, we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk. If we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words, and we will look at the cross-attention weights, we will see that no word points to the last lambda speech frames. This means that these three words will be emitted. If we look at the main results of ADAPT, we plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging, that is, the latency measure, and we also consider the computational aware average lagging that accounts for the models computational times to predict the output. So we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot, but also we want that they are restricted on the left. And we compare with previous strategies that are also applied to offline models, that are the with key strategy and the local agreement, and we compare also with the state-of-the-art architectures specifically tailored for simultaneous speech translation. These are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on German. We see that ADAPT outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models, since the curves are shifted over the left, and we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational aware time, ADAPT is the fastest strategy. If you want to discover more results, read our paper, and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous help put to facilitate the reproducibility of our work. Thanks for your attention.</sample>
    <sample id="217">The research introduces Scene2Unseen, a method for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation, addressing the limitations of existing models that focus on single attributes. The method, D-CGE, uses disentangled controllable generation to learn attribute concepts from scene values and employs disentangle loss to manage attribute combinations. A unified evaluation framework, M-AE, is proposed to evaluate different granularities of attributes without needing large-scale labeled data. Experiments show that D-CGE outperforms baseline models in attribute controllability and test quality, especially with attribute-oriented prompts. The method also demonstrates the ability to generalize from seen attributes to unseen combinations, outperforming models like E2C and A2C. The research concludes that the proposed method effectively transforms scene attributes into unseen attribute combinations, enhancing compositional generation capabilities.</sample>

It involves two stages: a qualification task to assess annotators' ability to evaluate multiple dimensions and an endurance task to test their capacity for handling heavy workloads. The study categorizes workers into four types and finds that only 6% of participants pass both stages. The pipeline achieves high inter-annotator agreement and is cost-effective compared to cloud research workers. However, it has limitations, such as only testing English summarizations and not guaranteeing the training of correctness. Future work will explore hiring high-quality workers and applying the pipeline to various tasks and platforms.</sample>

    <sample id="259">Yusen Zhang from Penn State University presents the Exemplar dataset, a comprehensive resource for cross-lingual semantic parsing across multiple natural languages and representations. The dataset includes 90 datasets, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 million representations, and 22 languages from 15 families. Zhang evaluates models using six settings: translate test, monolingual, multilingual, cross-lingual zero-shot, and cross-lingual few-shot transfer. The encoder-decoder model, specifically encoder-decoder, achieves the best performance across all datasets. The study reveals that multilingual training improves encoder-decoder performance, except for English in some datasets. Cross-lingual transfer performance varies, with zero-shot transfer showing significant gaps and few-shot transfer reducing these gaps. The research highlights that encoder-decoder models outperform previous works and that multilingual training can boost performance on target languages. However, multilingual models like CoT and BERT still fall short for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.

The instability of in-context learning arises from design choices, leading to biased predictions.

Experiments show that domain context calibration, which uses random in-domain words, significantly improves model performance, especially on tasks with high domain label bias. The method outperforms previous calibration methods, which used single predefined tokens. The findings suggest that using random in-domain words is more effective than random English words in addressing domain label bias.</sample>

    <sample id="267">Hello everyone, my name is Yuxin Zhang from the Penn State University. Today, I'm going to present our work, EXAMPLER, on cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and multiple representations. Semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as SQL and lambda calculus. And cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations. As shown in this figure, we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to SQL, lambda calculus, and etc. Existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on datasets of limited tasks and applications. For instance, there are lacks of coverage on certain natural language, the Chinese is missing, and the lambda calculus is missing. Or there are only evaluated on certain neural model. So to this end, we propose EXAMPLER, but provide a uniform dataset EXAMPLER for cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and multiple representations. It contains 90 datasets in various domains, 5 semantic parsing tasks, 8 million representations, and 22 natural languages in 15 language families. And to better evaluate our benchmark, we consider the six settings for training and evaluation. The first one is translate test. We use Google translate API to translate source to the target language, then use monolingual model to train and evaluation. And for example, we train the English model on English query, and during inference, we translate the German query using API to English, and then use the trained model to predict the SQL. And we test monolingual model. In this setting, the source language is the same as target language, for example, German to German or English to English. We also test monolingual few shot setting, but training monolingual models with only 10% of training data. And we test multilingual model, which we train one multilingual model for all languages. For example, we put the German, English, Chinese queries together to train a multilingual model, and during inference, we can use this model to translate German queries or Chinese query, or et cetera. And we also consider cross-lingual zero shot and few shot transfer. We train on one source language and transfer to another language. So during training, we train on English query or the combination of English and German few shot queries to train a multilingual model to predict the SQL output. And we found many interesting results. So regarding analyze of monolingual models, we evaluate on two groups of models, including encoder PDR, which stands for Multilingual Pretrained Encoders with Pointer Based Decoders such as XLNLP and BERT PDR. And we evaluate encoder-decoder models, which is Multilingual Pretrained Encoder-Decoder models such as M-BART and MT5. We found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets. And we evaluate on MT5 and EXAMPLER on multilingual setting. We found that encoder-decoder or encoder PDR can be improved by training in a mixture of various languages. And we found that it is because most of the major natural languages can obtain performance gain, except that English performance drops in seven datasets and only gains in three datasets. I think this is known as curse of multilinguality. We also compare the cross-lingual performance gap. In this figure, the blue line is cross-lingual few shot transfer, the orange line is cross-lingual zero shot transfer, while the green line is the monolingual setting. We found that by comparing the green and orange line, we found that for zero shot setting, the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant, and by comparing blue and orange line, we found that for few shot setting, the transfer gap is shortened rapidly. We also find some other interesting findings. For example, encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results. But training on English natural language can significantly boost the performance of few shot on target natural languages. And we found that multilingual language models such as CoT and BERT are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks. To sum up, we build EXAMPLER, a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and multiple representations. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multilingual language models, and our results show many interesting findings, and et cetera. And welcome to visit our paper and code. Thanks for listening.</sample>

    <sample id="275">Hi, I'm Xianbing, PhD student at the University of Washington. Today, I'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair NLP models. So language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data. Political news media are well covered in their pre-training data. According to a survey of the C4 corpus, we can see that New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Huffington Post, etc. are well covered in language model training data. This has created a mixed blessing for language model applications. So on one hand, they were able to learn from diverse perspectives, which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas. On the other hand, these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications. To this end, we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, specifically by asking the following questions. First, how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases? Secondly, how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks, and whether that might result in fairness issues in NLP applications? So we first propose to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires such as the political compass test. This ensures to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature. So some preliminary results demonstrate that first, language models do have varying political leanings. They occupy all four quadrants on the political compass. We can also see that GPT-4 is the most liberal language model of all. And GPT-3 is generally more socially liberal than BERT-3 and its variants. Secondly, we aim to investigate to which extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data. So we conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their political leaning. By further pre-training language models on such partisan corpora, we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also correspondingly shift. For example, for Roberta, further fine-tuned and further trained on the left-leaning Reddit corpus, we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its political biases. And we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarization that's prevalent in our modern society. So we divide pre-training corpora into pre-45th President of the United States and after 45th President of the United States. We separately pre-train language models on the two different temporal corpora. We can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017. So this indicates that language models can also pick up the polarization in our society. So last but not least, we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection to NLP applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications. So we see that if we investigate the per category performance, that is to say, if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leaning of news media, we can see a pattern that, for example, for hate speech detection, left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups, however, are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful folk groups in our society. And vice versa, right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men, however, worse at detecting hate speech targeting black LGBTQ+ and other minority communities. Similar trends also happen for fake news detection, where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning and vice versa. This in we further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political leanings do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social categories. There are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that. This indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models. For example, if a right-leaning language model were to be fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation and deployed to a popular social media platform, this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control. So this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political biases. So a little bit of discussion. We would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases. It's like between C and K. So if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data, the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, ultimately creating fairness issues. If we do try to sanitize somehow, we will also risk censorship or exclusion, and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data. So it's kind of like the electric trolley problem. Okay, great. I think that's pretty much all I have for today. Thank you for your time.</sample>

The current span-based UIE model relies on precise span boundaries, which can be ambiguous, leading to potential mislabeling. FSUIE proposes a fuzzy span approach, where the target boundary is represented as a continuous distribution, allowing for more flexible attention. This is achieved by using a sampling function to convert the distribution into discrete values for calculating fuzzy span loss, which includes binary cross-entropy and KL divergence. The model introduces a fuzzy span attention layer, which dynamically adjusts the attention span and ensures a more reasonable attention distribution. Experiments on tasks like named entity recognition, relationship extraction, and aspect sentiment triplet extraction showed significant improvements with FSUIE, especially on small-scale data. The model's ability to focus on semantic information within a limited range of tokens was confirmed, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of FSUIE in various information extraction tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="285">The presentation by Mingqi Gao from Peking University focuses on the work 'Reference Matters: Benchmarking Factor Error Correction for Dialogue Summarization with FinGrant Evaluation Framework.' The key issue addressed is the presence of factual errors in summaries generated by models, particularly in dialogue summarization. Two main solutions are proposed: introducing fact-related objectives in model training to improve faithfulness and developing a separate error correction model (FEC) to correct these errors. The current evaluation methods for FEC models, which rely on fact-based metrics, are criticized for being vague and potentially misleading. Gao suggests a new taxonomy for factual errors, distinguishing between content-based and form-based errors, and introduces an evaluation framework based on alignment, classification, and comparison. The findings indicate that training FEC models with reference summaries from dialogue datasets improves performance, and there is a need to change evaluation methods. The presentation concludes with the potential of combining human-annotated data with synthetic data to enhance FEC models.</sample>

    <sample id="289">Hello, my name is Kai-yan and I will be presenting our work titled "When Does Translation Require Context: A Data-Driven Multilingual Exploration." This work was done in collaboration with Patrick Fernhout, Emile Liu, Andre F. D. Martins, and Graham Neubig. So a lot of translations depend on context. For example, how would we translate mole in this sentence? Well, if the previous sentence was, things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out, then mole refers to a spy. But if the previous sentence was, could it be anything serious, doctor? Then mole refers to a birthmark. So depending on context, the meaning of the word changes and therefore is translation changes as well. However, evaluating how well models can translate cases like this is pretty hard. Firstly, because only a small portion of translations depend on context, which makes corpus level metrics like BLEU unable to capture these translations. And some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations, but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages, since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human creation. In this work, we try to answer these two questions: first, when does translation require context, and second, how well do models handle these cases? To answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context during translation. In the previous work, we introduced cXMI as a measure for context usage by machine translation models. And this is done by measuring how much information the context C provides about the target Y, given the source X. You can think of cXMI as the information gained from giving context to the model. In this work, we extend cXMI to pointwise cXMI, which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. We can think of words that have high PCXMI as ones that require context for translation. Now we analyze words with high PCXMI to look for patterns between these words. And we perform our analysis on transcripts of TED Talks that have been translated from English to 14 different languages. We perform our analysis at three different levels. First, we look at part of speech tags that have high PCXMI, and this allows us to find, for example, dual pronouns in Arabic that have relatively high PCXMI. And this can be explained because English doesn't have dual pronouns, so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into Arabic. Similarly, we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose the appropriate verb form. We then look at vocabulary items that have high PCXMI averaged over all of its different occurrences. And this helps us identify cases like the one here, where in Chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document. And similarly, we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality. And finally, we look at individual tokens that have high PCXMI, and this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself, but that's rather expressed in the sentence structure, such as ellipsis resolution. So now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation. For each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we create taggers to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon. And we call our tagger the Multilingual Discourse-Aware, or MUDa, tagger. We can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena. We then use the MUDa tagger by applying the tagger on a parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation. And we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the MUDa tagger has identified. And finally, we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate different models on document-level machine translation. First of all, when we use corpus level metrics, so for BLEU, we find that context-agnostic models have the best performance. But then if we use COMET, context-aware models perform best. And if we use word F measure, then models with or without context have comparable performance. This again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus level metrics alone. Now we use the MUDa benchmark to evaluate models, and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion. But these models are not much better than models that do not use context for other phenomena like ellipses, pronouns, and verb form. So this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation. We also compared different commercial systems, and our benchmark shows that DeepL is usually more accurate than Google Translate for document-level translation. To summarize, we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context. And then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level translation, which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not, and which translation systems are good at document-level translation. Thank you so much for your attention, see you in Toronto.</sample>

    <sample id="292">Hi, welcome to our presentation of DeepL, a new corpus for German text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level. My name is Regina Stoddens, and I will guide you through the first part of the presentation. Let's first define text simplification. Text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group, as people with reading problems on non-native speakers. To train a text simplification model, we require parallel pairs of text, for example, of documents or sentences. In the example here, you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex German sentence and its translation into plain language. To simplify the sentence, different techniques are possible, as you can see in the example, such as lexical substitution, clause deletion, clause deletion reordering, or insertion of words. We now propose our new corpus DeepL, because in the recent years, there were some problems with existing corpora. So for example, these corpora here are too small to train a text simplification model on. The others three models which are proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be error-prone in their alignments. Therefore, we propose our new corpus DeepL, which is split into two sub-corpora, DeepL APA and DeepL Web. DeepL APA is based on news texts. In DeepL APA, we aligned 483 documents, all manually. It results in roughly 13,000 parallel sentence pairs. For DeepL Web, this corpus includes different domains, and we also align all of these 750 documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods. In total, we result in 30,450 sentence pairs. We analyzed our sentence pairs a little bit more, so for example, on the type of simplification. As you can see here, the Bible texts are much stronger simplified than, for example, the news texts, other language learner texts. On all levels, regarding, for example, lexical simplification, structural simplification, also the overall level of simplification. Furthermore, you can see that our DeepL corpus has a high variety of different simplification transformations. So for example, in the DeepL APA corpus, we have much more reordering and word additions than we have in the DeepL Web corpus. On the other hand, in the Web corpus, we have much more rephrasings. So let's now see what we can do with this corpus. Hello, I am Omar, and now I will talk about the use cases for our dataset DeepL. So for the first use case, we can evaluate automatic alignment methods. In the recent years, there has been a lot of alignment methods, but in the context of machine translations, where we have two parallel documents written in different languages and we want to extract alignments of sentences in post documents. But in our use case, we are trying to extract alignments between sentences of two parallel documents, having the same language, having the same content, but they are on a different complexity levels. Now, as we have our dataset DeepL, which have manually aligned sentences, we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods. And we did some adaptations to the proposed methods, and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper. At the end, we concluded that the best alignment, automatic alignment method to use for German text simplification is the method of MASS align. And you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper. The second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text. We have fine-tuned two different models. We have fine-tuned the model of long-impart to produce document level simplifications, and we also fine-tuned the normal base-impart to produce sentence level simplifications. You can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper. We concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores. And we proposed those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future. Thank you so much for your attention, and we hope to meet all of you during the conference. Thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="293">Hi, I'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection, in which we introduce the altentities corpus. My name is Javad Hosseini, and this is a joint work with Philip Radlinsky, Silvia Parati, and Annie Churvis. Our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice. Consider this alternative question: Did you mean easy on me or I got a feeling? Here, a user wants to select between one of these two songs. The most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example, by saying the name of the song, easy on me, or its position, the first one. But sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation. This could happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song, or the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to disambiguate, or when the user wants to specify a preference. Here are some examples of indirect references, for example, the newer one or the song that's not energetic. This is an important problem in conversational systems and also for BING marking LLM's entity understanding. We're not aware of a public dataset, a large-scale public dataset for the task, so we collect one using crowd annotation. Our dataset covers three different domains: music, books, and recipes. Our data set collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion setup. The cartoon has three speech bubbles. In the first bubble, Bob says, remember that song we were listening to yesterday. And with that, Bob sets the context. In the second speech bubble, Alice says, do you mean easy on me or I got a feeling? Which is the alternative question. And in the third speech bubble, Bob uses an indirect reference to select one of these entities, for example, the newer one. We provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically, but the third one is filled in by the annotator. The first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain. The second one, which is the alternative question, is generated as follows. We always use a simple template, do you mean A or B, where A and B are sampled from Wikipedia. Here are the different sampling methods we've used. When we move higher in the list, the entities become more similar to each other, and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation. The first one is uniform at random. The second one is when the entities have similar titles, for example, two books with the name the return. The third one is when they have similar descriptions on Wikipedia, and finally, when they have similar info boxes or attributes on Wikipedia, for example, the same genre or the same artist for a song. When we show these alternative questions to the annotators, they know the name of these entities, but they don't necessarily know about the entities. So what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities. For songs, we simply show a Google search link to each song. And then ask the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song. Here's for example, the Google search result for the song easy on me. For the recipes and books domain, we show some background text from Wikipedia. For recipes, we additionally show their images, again from Wikipedia, so that the annotators know how they look like. Then we ask the annotators to pick one of these entities, for example, here the first one, and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions. For example, the one with the piano music. Here are some examples from our data set. For example, the one without words, not the one with the 12 year old boy, or the fictional one, or comes from Azerbaijan, and so on. The altentities corpus has 6,000 alternative questions across three domains, and it has 42,000 indirect referring expressions. Results with T5 large model are summarized below. If the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators, the in the accuracy is really high. It's around 92 to 95 percent. But this is not realistic. If the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge, then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent, which is more realistic. For example, when the language model retrieves the background knowledge. If the language model has access only to entity names, then the accuracy is only 60 percent, so there's a lot of room for improvement. We've also shown that the models are domain generalizable. Here is a link to our data set. Thanks.</sample>

    <sample id="299">The discussion focuses on improving the robustness of NLP models by addressing the issue of model over-reliance on shortcuts learned during training. These shortcuts, which are correlations between input attributes and labels, lead to strong performance on in-distribution samples but poor generalization on out-of-distribution data. Current mitigation methods, which often require auxiliary models, face limitations such as needing specific domain knowledge and not aligning with the learner's behavior. The proposed solution is a training method that uses a minimax objective to adjust the learner's focus on underrepresented hard examples, thus improving out-of-distribution performance. This method does not assume the type of shortcuts in the dataset and relies on the learner's own training dynamics to generate example weights. The method is evaluated on three datasets, showing consistent improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing methods.</sample>

    <sample id="301">Hi everyone, I'm Jenny, a first year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, and today I'll be presenting our work, AnL Positionality: Characterizing Design Biases of Datasets and Models. This work was done in collaboration with some folks at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, namely Sebastian Santi, Ronan Labras, Katarina Rainerica, and Martin Sapp. So let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article trying to remove toxic content. You might turn towards a popular API like Perspective API for toxicity detection. And this works really well if you're Carl Jones. Where perspective API is able to detect toxic instances, but that's not really the case for Aditya Sharma, where perspective API is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in Indian contexts. This is an example of a design bias where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations. Design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the NLP researchers and model developers. Positionality is simply the perspectives that people hold as a result of their demographics, identity, and life experiences. This is a concept widely used in critical studies, specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces. And as a researcher, positionality can influence the research process and its outcomes because it can change the decisions that researchers make. And so one question that people might ask is do datasets and models have positionality? And we're not trying to say that models and datasets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences, but they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others. So prior work has suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality, such as cultural gaps in models and datasets, as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality. However, these works really don't look at comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves. And studying model and dataset positionality is increasingly important as NLP tasks become more subjective and socially oriented. And it's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind APIs. So to study dataset and model positionality, we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models. Our framework works in two main steps. The first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators. And we opt to do this over looking at the demographics of original datasets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance, and because demographics are rarely collected and shared. And so we opt to re-annotate data to get many annotators for instance and to get a rich set of demographic data. We then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using a Pearson's R correlation score. And thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and datasets, predictions, and labels, as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions. Our framework is largely enabled through Lab in the Wild, an online crowdsourcing platform, former HCI collaborator. And Lab in the Wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to platforms like MTurk, which largely have participants from the US or India. And further Lab in the Wild still is able to get high quality data. We host two tasks on Lab in the Wild, one of them being social acceptability. And the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry dataset, and then they'll write how socially acceptable a situation is. Afterwards, to stay engaged in the study, they can compare their responses to an AI and others. We then compared these annotations with social chemistry, delphi, and GPT-4. We then replicate a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task, where they'll read an instance from dynahate and write whether they think it's an instance of hate speech. We then compared these annotations with dynahate, perspective API, rewire a GPT-4 in GPT-4. Our study in the end amassed over 16,000 annotations from over 1,000 annotators from 87 countries. So now we're better equipped to answer who do NLP datasets and models align with the most? We find that there is positionality in NLP. For example, we find that datasets and models are most aligned to English speaking countries. So for the GPT-4 social acceptability analysis, we find that it's most aligned to Confucian and English speaking countries. We find that dynahate is also most aligned to English speaking countries. We also find most additional align with people who have a college education. So for GPT-4 in the social acceptability task, we find that it's most aligned to people with a college education or graduate school education. And we find the same for dynahate, where it's most aligned to people with a college education. However, when models and datasets are aligned to specific populations, some are inevitably left behind. An example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts. We find this in the GPT-4 social acceptability task as well as the dynahate task analysis as well. So given that there is positionality in NLP, what can we do about it? So we have a few recommendations for this. First one is keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process. And the other is to do NLP research with a lens of perspectivism. Our third recommendation is to build specialized datasets and models within four specific communities. And a good example of this is the Muscani initiative. I mean, we want to emphasize that inclusive NLP isn't just making all technologies work for everyone. And so that concludes our presentation, but if you'd like to learn more, feel free to check out our dashboard for the most updated analysis results and our paper. Thank you.</sample>

WSL uses weak labels from sources like heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or crowdsourcing, which are cheaper but noisy. Recent WSL methods require clean validation data, which is not always available, leading to performance issues. The study questions the necessity of clean data, the number of clean samples needed, and the best use of them. Findings show that WSL methods need clean data to perform well, and performance can be improved by fine-tuning on clean samples. The study recommends reporting model selection criteria, comparing WSL with full supervision, and considering continuous fine-tuning. The research is open-sourced for further exploration.</sample>

Traditional models like GPT-3 and T5 face challenges in maintaining output structure alignment, often requiring extensive training data and decoding strategies. CodeIE addresses this by using code format prompts, which align input and output structures, resulting in more accurate and structured outputs.

The work addresses the issue of non-smooth representation spaces in NMT, which limits its generalization ability. The proposed framework, INK, involves a training loop that extracts key knowledge to guide the adapter, which adjusts representations and updates the datastore asynchronously. Experiments show that INK outperforms state-of-the-art KMT systems, achieving higher BLEU scores with less memory space. The framework is effective even with small adapters and demonstrates that combining the adapter and datastore further improves performance. The research concludes with a proposal for a normal training framework that iteratively refines the representation space of the NMT model, achieving better translation performance with less memory and faster inference.</sample>
    <sample id="334">Hi, my name is Adam Szarkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination. As you may know, different dependency structures are assumed by different theories and corpus approaches. So for example, in universal dependencies, the structure of the coordinate Lisa, Bart and Maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure, so in this case Lisa. A similar approach is assumed in the meaning text theory, where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct. So these two approaches are symmetric. Right, they single out one of the conjuncts. Now there also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures such as the prague approach, the conjunction headed approach assumed in prague dependency treebanks, where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction. So we get dependencies from and to all the conjuncts. And finally, there's also a multi headed approach that's used for example in de katzons word grammar, where all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure. So we get dependencies from the governor here loves to all conjuncts separately. These about and make. Now the aim of this paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these two. Okay, the argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization that I will explain on the basis of these examples. So in English as you might know, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, while adjuncts may be further away, right? So March read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb, while March read yesterday it is much worse, right? Because here between the verb and the direct object there is an adjunct yesterday. However, this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long, because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct. This is illustrated here. So both these sentences are fine. March read this absolutely fascinating book about the bees yesterday is okay, where instead of it we have this long and p. But it's also okay to say March read yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about bees. So the reason in here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb, it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization, which says that shorter dependencies are preferred. So these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies, so the ones that are not constant among these two structures. So here we have a dependency from red to the adjunct of length seven measured in words, and from red to book of length four, so to get it eleven. When you move, when you swap these two constituents, the sum of these two dependencies becomes six, right? So instead of eleven six, much shorter, that's why this sounds quite okay, right? It violates one principle but it satisfies another one. Okay, so what we did, we extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen treebank and see the paper why we don't use universal dependencies. And these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter, so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables. And also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length difference. So when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows, the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger, right? So the proportion is bigger of the left short conjunct. But what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left, right? So the governor is on the left in this example, I saw Bart and Lisa, so it's the governor, is on the left. It's absent in the second example, Homer came and sneezed, here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor, right? So in such cases, the left conjunct prefers to be shorter, the more so the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts. But when the governor is on the right, as here, left governs the coordinate then and that, this effect disappears. So we show that by measuring length in characters, that's the first column, in syllables, the middle column, and in words, the right column, so I'll concentrate on the right one. What we see here is that when the governor is on the left, the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words, and the same is observed when there is no governor, as in coordination of sentences, but when the governor is on the right, this tendency disappears. And we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two. So see the paper for the full argument and arguments and talk to us about the poster session. Thank you.</sample>

    <sample id="337">The presentation introduces a novel approach to handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in embedding-based downstream models. The method involves using a word relationship graph to infer OOV word meanings by associating them with relevant words based on word formation and lexical rules. The model uses a graph neural network to process the graph, with a self-attention network to assign node attributes. It employs a two-level graph attention network to reduce noise and a graph-level representation to capture the entire graph information. The model also uses contrastive learning to align the graph-level embedding with the background embedding. Extensive experiments show that the model outperforms existing methods in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks. The model is adaptable to different languages, with better performance in agglutinative languages and challenges in fusional languages.</sample>
    <sample id="338">Bingxin presents a research study on evaluating the utility of human explanations in natural language processing. The study, conducted by a collaborative team, introduces a unified data structure to standardize multiple datasets into a common format. This structure includes baseline and infusion settings to test model performance with and without explanations. The research critiques traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, which focus on word similarity, and proposes a new metric called TRUE, which also considers the usefulness of explanations during model fine-tuning. The study evaluates human explanations across five datasets, including COSE, ECQA, ESNLI, and COMVE, using both TRUE and the simulability score. The findings show that TRUE outperforms the simulability score, particularly in datasets like COMVE and ESNLI, where explanation utility varies based on task and format. The research highlights the importance of context and negation in explanations, suggesting that the quality of explanations is task-dependent. The study concludes by advocating for high-quality human-AI collaboration in annotation jobs and encourages further research in this area.</sample>

    <sample id="345">The paper by Matthias Landmann, Alexander Colla, and Ivan Tiedoff introduces a novel approach to compositional generalization without trees, using multi-set tagging and latent permutations. Traditional methods often rely on trees to capture compositional processes, but these can be computationally expensive and require specific preprocessing. The authors propose a neural sequence-to-sequence model that predicts output from input without trees, using multi-set tagging to capture all relevant tokens and a permutation model to order them. This method addresses challenges such as unknown input-output alignment and multiple consistent permutations. The model outperforms existing tree-less models on the COGS benchmark, demonstrating strong generalization to deeper recursion. The paper also discusses technical challenges, including the NP-hard nature of finding the highest scoring permutation, and introduces a GPU-friendly continuous relaxation to approximate solutions.</sample>

    <sample id="348">Myra, along with Eszter Mosh and Dan Jurafsky, explores the prevalence of social biases in large language models (LLMs) and the limitations of current stereotype detection methods. They propose a novel approach using instruction-tuned LMs to generate personas based on identity markers, which are then analyzed for stereotypes using a method called 'marked words.' This method identifies words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones, revealing essentializing narratives and stereotypes. The study finds that while generated personas contain more stereotypes than human-written ones, they often reflect positive stereotypes that are harmful. The research highlights the need for researchers to address positive stereotypes, use intersectional lenses, and increase transparency in bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="350">The presentation by Simone Tedesci discusses the concept of superhuman performance in NLP, focusing on the SuperGlue and SQuAD benchmarks. It highlights that while models often outperform humans in these benchmarks, the comparison is flawed due to several issues. These include evaluating humans on small subsets of the test set, errors in the test data, and the use of simple methods to estimate human performance. The paper also points out that pay rates for human annotators are often low, affecting the quality of the data. Furthermore, details about the annotator pool are often omitted, making the claims of superhuman performance scientifically meaningless. The presentation concludes by recommending more reliable benchmark construction to avoid repeating these mistakes.</sample>

Experiments showed that Transformer models and larger models generally perform better, while more fine-tuning examples improve performance. Two hypotheses were tested: adaptive overfitting and temporal drift. Adaptive overfitting was not observed, while temporal drift was confirmed as a cause of performance drop.

    <sample id="353">The paper 'Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions' by Houshang Li, Mohammad Masoumi, and Irina Golovchic explores the challenge of generating code from natural language descriptions, particularly when specifications are missing. The authors propose an interactive approach where clarification questions are used to gather necessary specifications. They introduce a method to create a synthetic dataset, Code QA, with questions about key operations. The study uses heuristics to identify key operations and employs a pipeline for code generation, which includes a clarification predictor, question selector, and code generator. The results show that while the method is challenging, it improves code generation accuracy. The paper concludes with an analysis of the impact of clarified key operations on code quality and invites feedback on their work.</sample>

    <sample id="360">Hello everyone, my name is Yin and my colleague Ji Yang will be presenting our research on Multi-Teach, improving multi-model zero-shot learning via instruction tuning. With advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data-efficient way. Recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions. However, most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out. Therefore, in this work, we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-model pre-trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multi-modal tasks. Additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in the availability of instruction dataset between NLP and multi-modal. There exist more than 1,600 language-only instruction tasks. However, there is no large-scale publicly available multi-modal instruction task. Therefore, this motivates us to build a multi-modal instruction tuning dataset. Here, we present Multi-Teach, the first multi-modal instruction tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multi-modal tasks covering 10 broad categories. These tasks are derived from 21 existing open source datasets, and each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions. For investigating multi-modal instruction tuning on our proposed dataset, we take OFA, a unified multi-modal pre-trained model, as our base model. OFA uses a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens, and the coordinate of a bounding box. Here, we show some example instances from our Multi-Teach dataset. To unify the processing of various input and output data type, we follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format, in which the input text, images, instruction, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space. OK, now I am going to talk about multi-modal instruction tuning. So, for the training dataset, we use 53 tasks from the natural language group for training, and we sample 10,000 instances per task. For testing, we reserve the entire commonsense reasoning group for testing, and we select additional 5 tasks from the VQA and the miscegenous group. We use all the instances in the test split for each task. In addition, we randomly sample 20 tasks from the test split of natural instruction as unseen tasks for NLP. So, we use pre-trained OFA large model as a base model. During training, we mix all the instances for all the tasks. Each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates. So, during test, for each task, we conduct a total of 5 experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment. We report the mean and max performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all 5 experiments. If the task is a multi-modal classification task, we report accuracy. If it's a multi-modal generation task, we report rouge-l. For NLP task, we report rouge-l as well. We also introduced additional evaluation metric called sensitivity. So, this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task, regardless of slight variation in the wording of the instruction. Here is our main result. As we can see, instruction tuning can significantly improve OFA's performance on unseen multi-modal tasks. Also, transfer learning from natural instruction dataset can benefit instruction tuning. Here, we can see as the amount of task increase, the model achieve better performance and in the meantime, lower sensitivity. So, we do one experiment. We use one instruction versus five instruction. As we can see, using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot. So, this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategy on the model's sensitivity. As we can see, by transfer learning from natural instruction dataset, the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original OFA model. We also can see transfer learning from natural instruction dataset can help OFA to achieve much better performance on the natural instruct dataset. So, overall, we propose a first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset. We significantly improve the zero-shot capability of OFA, and we explore different transfer learning technique and show their benefits. We design a new metric called sensitivity. So, one more thing, we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional vision language tasks, and we will release them soon. This is a QR code for our data and model. Thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="361">Armin Nurbaevschi, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, presents a project called CounterComp, which aims to enhance compositional generalization in multi-step quantitative reasoning tasks. These tasks involve complex arithmetic operations, and current neural models struggle with tasks involving more than two steps due to their tendency to memorize patterns. CounterComp addresses this by using counterfactual scenarios to improve model performance. The approach involves mining positive and negative examples from training data to create auxiliary metric learning loss, which adjusts the model's learning process. This method has shown to improve both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, meaning the model can generalize better to new data. The project also emphasizes the importance of models attending to meaningful tokens in the input, which relate to significant operations in the output. The research is supported by co-authors and advisors from Carnegie Mellon University and JP Morgan.</sample>
