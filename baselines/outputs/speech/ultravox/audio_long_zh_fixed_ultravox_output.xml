    <sample id="11">We have a set of over six hundred fifty two two sentence explanations of jokes that we use so how well do language models do at our various tasks? We look first at matching and quality ranking on the matching task our best model which is clip fine tuned on the corpus we annotated achieves around sixty two percent accuracy on this task this is relative to a twenty percent random guessing baseline that's one in five however humans get around ninety four percent on the same task representing a big gap in humor understanding now you might be wondering how well do models that don't have to do computer vision do we wanted to test models like G P T four on this corpus but G P T four can't take in Pixels directly so separately we also consider a setting where we take language models like G P T four and condition them to do the exact same tasks but give them a human author description of the image even with this additional annotation there's still quite a big performance gap between G P T four and human on the matching and quality ranking tasks speaking of G P T four let's take a look at some of its joke explanations for the third task of explanation generation here we prompted G P T four to generate an explanation for this cartoon and it'll be back you can see some errors highlighted so for example G P T four claims that the customer is the one saying he'll be back when I would argue it's pretty clear it's the people who are working at this establishment are saying this and there are a few other errors as well this is borne out in human evaluation experiments where in a blind AB study human explanations are preferred to Five shot Gp t four explanations in more than two thirds of cases overall we're super excited to see what folks do with our dataset.</sample>

    <sample id="13">The sweet spot analysis is a method used in adaptive inference to reduce the inference time of large language models by using low-capacity models for easy samples and then training them separately on the entire training set, while running them sequentially until a classifier decides to halt the computation for early exit multiple classifiers are fit to the model following intermediate transformer layers they are all trained together and for inference a single sample is run through the model until a classifier decides to halt that way saving the computation which would have been exhausted by the rest of the model so let us look at this illustration on the left hand side you see the standard early exit model on the right hand side is our method we can see that each transformer layer only receives updates from its following classifier's loss function therefore avoiding the conflicting gradient problem completely</sample>

    <sample id="74">The code snippet provided appears to be related to the development of a deep learning model, specifically a neural network architecture called Densomics. The code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It defines two classes `Densomics` and `DensomicsModel`, which represent the neural network architecture and its corresponding model.
2. The `Densomics` class has several methods:
   - `__init__`: Initializes the model with parameters.
   - `compile`: Compiles the model with a specific loss function and optimizer.
   - `fit`: Trains the model on a dataset using the compiled model.
   - `predict`: Makes predictions on new data using the trained model.
3. The `DensomicsModel` class represents the neural network architecture itself. It has several attributes:
   - `layers`: A list of layers in the model.
   - `weights`: The weights of each layer.
4. The code also includes some utility functions such as `random_sample` and `sample_from_densomics`, which seem to be used for sampling data from the model.

Some observations about the code:

- The use of `random_sample` suggests that the code may be designed for generating random samples from the model, possibly for training or testing purposes.
- The `sample_from_densomics` function seems to be used to sample data from the model, but it's unclear how this function works without more context.
- The code uses a lot of nested loops and conditional statements, suggesting that it may be implementing some form of iterative algorithm or optimization technique.

Overall, the code provides a basic structure for building a deep learning model using the Densomics architecture. However, without more context or information about the specific requirements of the project, it's difficult to provide a more detailed analysis or insights into the code.</sample>

    <sample id="77">根据提供的信息，研究人员在改进自然语言处理（NLP）中的总结效率方面取得了显著进步。他们开发了一种新数据集，这些数据包含人类示例和反馈，以改进总结效率。该数据集被用于测试各种NLP模型，并且发现这些模型能够有效地利用人类反馈来提高总结效率。

研究人员还发现，使用大型语言模型进行总结效率计算时存在挑战。然而，他们认为这主要是因为这些模型对数据的处理能力有限，而不是由于数据本身的问题。

最后，研究人员提出了几个新的NLP任务，包括语句编辑、自动化总结错误和评估总结效率。这使得他们能够更全面地了解NLP模型在改进总结效率方面的潜力。</sample>

    <sample id="97">Simultaneous speech translation (Simultaneous speech translation) is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real-time, enabling cross-language communication. It involves multiple models that work together to predict the translation based on the input speech frames. The main problems of current simultaneous speech translation models are:

1. High computational times to read the output
2. Computationally expensive average lagging
3. Limited model training data
4. Difficulty in handling long input speech frames
5. Inability to handle complex input speech frames such as accents, dialects, and regional variations.

The proposed solution is to use a single model that can handle all these complexities by shifting the attention weights over time, which allows it to adapt to different input speech frames and improve its performance.</sample>

The proposed training strategy with two components - temporal span extraction pre-training and time sensitive reinforcement learning - can improve the performance of L5 significantly. However, we also observe some performance fluctuation over different time periods which could be related to the training data balance future work can work on overcoming such reasoning biases in conclusion. We analyze and expose the temporal reasoning biases of L5 and propose the temp reason benchmark dataset that covers all three temporal reasoning types and comprehensive time periods.</sample>

    <sample id="129">"显性群体"（marked group）是指那些在语言中被特定词或词组标记为具有某种特征的群体。例如，在这个例子中，“显性群体”可能指的是那些被描述为“强壮”的女性群体，也可能指的是那些被描述为“美丽”的女性群体等。

显性群体通常与社会和文化背景有关，因此它们可以帮助我们理解这些群体的行为、价值观和信仰。然而，这些群体也可能受到各种形式的歧视和偏见。

在本研究中，我们使用了一个名为“显性群体”的方法来识别这些群体的特征。在这种方法中，我们将给定的词组标记为“显性群体”，并且通过分析这些词组的分布来确定这些群体的特征。

显性群体的特征包括：

* 被描述为“强壮”
* 被描述为“美丽”
* 被描述为“年轻”
* 被描述为“富有”

这些特征可以帮助我们了解这些群体的行为、价值观和信仰，并且可以用来开发更有效的政策和措施来改善他们的生活质量。

但是，这个方法也有其局限性，因为它可能会导致一些负面结果，如歧视和偏见。因此，我们需要考虑如何使用显性群体的方法以更好地解决这些问题。</sample>

    <sample id="146">The problem of omission in dialogue summarization is a challenging task that has been studied extensively in recent years, especially using large-scale pre-trained language models. These models can generate fluent and coherent summaries, but they often struggle with detecting missing information in the dialogues.

To address this issue, we propose an automatic method to produce omission labels for candidate summaries. We use a combination of different abstract models to generate diverse candidates and then refine them using post-editing methods. The proposed method consists of three frameworks:

1.  **Pre-Training**: We use pre-trained language models as input to generate candidate summaries.
2.  **Post-Editing**: We use post-editing methods to refine the generated summaries based on detected omissions.
3.  **Refinement**: We refine the refined summaries further by combining the output from multiple models.

We evaluate our approach using a publicly available dataset and find that it improves the performance significantly compared to state-of-the-art models. Our results show that the precision recall score (f1 score) is around fifty percent, indicating that the task is very challenging.

Another question is what happens if we use omissions to refine the summary? We use a post editing method for summary refinement, which involves concatenating the candidate summary with omitted content as input and generating the refined summary in a sequence-to-sequence manner. From the figure, we see that the performance is largely boosted when the omission is provided, indicating that omission detection is a valuable task and the refinement based on detected omission is a promising direction for improvement in dialogue summarization.

Overall, our approach provides a systematic solution to the problem of omission in dialogue summarization, and we believe it has potential applications in various natural language processing tasks.</sample>

The goal is to link John with him and Maria with her, using conventional methods for this task need to enumerate all pairs of entities which have quadratic complexity for both computation and memory consumption.

Recently proposed cache-based methods use a fixed size cache and reduce the complexity to a linear level when the cache is full. However, there are always trade-offs between model efficiency and performance for Cache-Based models but we show that dual cache has the highest performance cost ratio to conclude dual cache uses local and global cache to separately store local and global entities it performs single cache and largely reduces the cache miss also dual cache is the most cost effective compared with single cache method so that's all for my talk thank you for listening.</sample>

    <sample id="165">The paper "Adaptive Common-Sense Reasoning" by Wenzeng Zhao, Ph.D., Cornell University, presents an approach to adaptive reasoning that exploits mutually exclusive explanations. The goal is to identify a plausible subset of explanations that can bridge the information gap between the context X and the outcome Y in a given scenario.

In this example, the author illustrates how to use Lipoor as an unsupervised learning method to maximize the likelihood of outcomes Y given the context X. The Lipoor objective consists of two parts: maximizing the likelihood of outcomes Y and preferring one explanation over the others.

The author also introduces an additional regularizer called Omega, which takes into account the number of possible explanations when the entropy of P of Z given x Y is larger than the log of M. This allows the model to minimize the entropy of P of Z given x Y in cases where there are more than M explanations received probability mass.

The results show that Lipoor outperforms other zero-shot models and previous best and supervised approaches, including a strong zero-shot series GPT-3 baseline with over four absolute points in accuracy.</sample>

It's trained on a large collection of texts comprising seven hundred eighty billion tokens. At the time of publication, it achieved state-of-the-art performance in hundreds of NLP tasks. The paper evaluates the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the MPT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model and comparing to state-of-the-art systems. The results show that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have a big influence in the case of several short prompting, but the most common error is omission errors.</sample>

    <sample id="171">There is no specific research on this topic mentioned in your question. However, I can provide some general information about embedding models.

Embedding models are a type of neural network architecture that have been widely used in natural language processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. They work by mapping input data into a lower-dimensional space using a set of learned weights and biases.

Some common types of embedding models include:

1. Word2Vec: This is a popular word embedding model that maps words to vectors in a high-dimensional space.
2. GloVe: Similar to Word2Vec, but uses a different algorithm to learn vector representations of words.
3. FastText: A fast and efficient word embedding model that uses a combination of techniques such as skip-gram and CBOW to learn vector representations of words.
4. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A pre-trained language model that has achieved state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks.

These models have been shown to be effective in various applications, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

Regarding the specific problem you mentioned, it's possible that there may be existing research on detecting whether an embedding model contains a watermark or not. However, without more context or details, it's difficult to say for sure.

If you're looking for research on this topic, I would suggest searching academic databases such as Google Scholar, arXiv, or ResearchGate for papers related to embedding models and watermarks. Additionally, you may want to consider reaching out to researchers in the field or contacting organizations that specialize in NLP and watermarking for more information.</sample>

我们通过比较不同类型的多语言 LLM来验证这一点。例如，我们使用了一个包含三个自然语言（英语、法语和日语）的数据集，并将每个语言的句子转换为另一个语言，然后使用Codex或Bloom等多语言 LLM来预测结果。在这种情况下，我们发现Codex或Bloom等多语言 LLM对于CLSP来说并不足够。

另一方面，Bloom等多语言 LLM也可以用于其他任务，如语音识别和翻译等。因此，我们认为Bloom等多语言 LLM对于CLSP来说是一个有用的工具，但它并不是最好的选择。

总之，我们的研究表明，Codex或Bloom等多语言 LLM对于CLSP来说并不是足够的，而其他方法如Bert等多语言 LLM可能更适合这个任务。</sample>

    <sample id="176">根据所给的英文内容，简要回答以下问题：如何定义下游 NLP 模型的公平性？

答案：下游NLP模型的公平性主要是指这些模型在处理不同类型的数据时是否能够避免偏见和不公平。例如，在语言模型中，偏见可能出现在不同类型的语句、情绪或社会背景上。在下游应用中，偏见可能会影响到预测结果的准确性。

具体来说，下游NLP模型的公平性可以通过评估它们对不同类型的数据的偏见程度来衡量。例如：

* 在语言模型中，偏见可能出现在不同类型的语句（如政治话题、商业话题等）或情绪（如愤怒、愉快等）。
* 在下游应用中，偏见可能会影响到预测结果的准确性，例如预测人群的行为或政策决策。

为了解决这一问题，我们可以使用多种方法，如：

* 使用偏见检测工具来评估模型对不同类型的数据的偏见程度。
* 使用多样化数据集来评估模型对不同类型的数据的偏见程度。
* 使用模型的特征来评估其对不同类型的数据的偏见程度。

通过这种方式，我们可以更好地理解下游NLP模型的公平性，并为下游应用设计更加公平和有效的模型。</sample>

    <sample id="183">Based on the provided text, it appears that the author is discussing how to create personas (personas) using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models.

The author mentions that they have done this work with Asin Diermush and Dan Jerowski in recent years, documenting the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs). However, these measures have various limitations, such as relying on hand constructed datasets that are time-consuming to curate and only measuring very specific stereotypes.

To address these limitations, the author suggests using a method called "marked words" which involves identifying the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones. This method can capture more patterns than human-written responses, but may not be able to fully mitigate biases.

The author also notes that there are common tropes that are reflected in these words, especially for women of color, and that these words often connect to long histories of Asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive.

Finally, the author concludes by recommending three recommendations for model owners:

1. Addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives.
2. Using intersectional lenses to study biases and harms.
3. Increasing transparency about bias mitigation methods.

It seems that the author is providing an overview of their research and methodology, rather than asking a specific question. If you could provide a clear question, I would be happy to try and assist further.</sample>

    <sample id="195">The complexity of Qa is due to the fact that it can be used as a generalization of complex question decomposition, which means that it can decompose more complex questions into smaller sub-questions. This is because Qa can generate answers based on the knowledge sources, including K B, Wikipedia, and text corpus. However, this also means that Qa may not always provide accurate answers, especially when dealing with incomplete knowledge sources.

One of the challenges in using Qa is determining the granularity of question decomposition, which refers to the level at which the question is decomposed into smaller sub-questions. In some cases, Qa may only provide answers based on the complete knowledge source, such as Wikipedia, without considering the partial information provided by other knowledge sources.

Another challenge is finding the optimal solution among various possible ones. Since Qa generates answers based on the knowledge sources, we need to consider the probability of each answer being correct. We can use a probabilistic reasoning approach over Qa to find the optimal solution. The approach involves building a schedule where each node represents an appropriate knowledge source for a given sub-question, and then taking into consideration the probability score of each node.

Finally, we need to aggregate the candidate answers from all the knowledge sources and output the top-k answers with highest probabilities. This step ensures that we get the most accurate answers while minimizing the number of unnecessary computations.

Overall, integrating knowledge from different sources, including K B, Wikipedia, and text corpus, can significantly improve the performance of Qa. By leveraging these sources, we can build a robust and accurate system that can handle complex questions effectively.</sample>

    <sample id="254">We observe that the distribution of uncertainty scores for each relation class is different, Moreover, it can be observed that frequent classes usually contain more lower average uncertainty than the long tail class. So we propose dynamic class uncertainty thresholds to filter out the threshold levels with high uncertainty. The calculation can be seen in this formula. Then we replace the original Ds label with the pseudo label that contains a lower uncertainty score than its class uncertainty threshold. In order to take full advantage of the Ds data for posting the performance of Docker model, we design the multi-phase training strategy to iteratively relabel the Ds data which is shown in this algorithm. We compare our framework with several strong base lines on two public datasets as shown in this table, our framework outperforms the previous base lines on both two datasets in conclusion the main contribution of our work is summarized as those four points the first one is our framework With uncertainty guided label denoising which greatly improves the label quality of the data the second one is the instance level uncertainty estimation method for overlapping relations the third one is the reactive relabelling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty threshold for the long tail problem the last one is the great performance improvement.</sample>

    <sample id="278">The marked words method is used to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones. This method involves assigning weights to each word in the lexicon based on its frequency of use within the marked group, as well as its frequency of use within the unmarked group. The weights are then used to calculate the probability of each word being associated with a particular stereotype.

In this case, the marked words method was used to analyze the stereotypes associated with different racial groups. For example, the word "vibrant" was found to be more likely to be associated with Asian women, while the word "petite" was found to be more likely to be associated with black women. These findings suggest that the marked words method can be used to identify patterns of stereotyping and essentializing narratives.

However, it's worth noting that the marked words method has some limitations. For instance, it may not capture all types of negative stereotypes, such as those related to disability or socioeconomic status. Additionally, the method relies heavily on the assumption that the marked words are representative of the entire population, which may not always be the case.</sample>

    <sample id="281">We use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the Multilingual Discourse aware or Muda Tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the Muda Tagger by applying the tagger on the corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation Metrics of choice on the context dependent examples that the tagger has identified and finally we use our benchmark as well as other Metrics to evaluate different models on the document level machine translation first of all when we use Corpus level Metrics so for blue we find that context aware models have the best performance but then if we use word measure then models with or without context have comparable performance this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best Document level translation system if we use Corpus level Metrics alone now we use the Muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that Context Aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that did not use context on other discourse phenomena like ellipses pronouns in verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that Deep is usually more accurate than Google translate for document level translation to summarize.</sample>

    <sample id="285">The evaluation framework used in this study is based on error metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy. The proposed approach involves training models with reference summaries from dialogues and evaluating their performance using these metrics. This can improve the performance of models by combining human-annotated data with synthetic data, which is a promising direction.

Current models struggle to correct factual errors by addition and cannot address attribute errors, modal errors, link errors, etc. Since the evaluation metric mainly consists of three steps alignment, classification, and comparison, we need to change the evaluation method for models introducing human corrected summaries during the training process.</sample>

    <sample id="296">The data was collected from different sources, including social media, Reddit, and Twitter, spanning a long time window of one and a half years. The data consisted of about three hundred short conversations made up of pairs of text one following the other. We repeated this process for both sources and for five varieties of English, which are listed here. 

We used the crowd sourcing platform Prolicious to have people annotate this data. We selected about fifteen Annotators for each of the English language varieties for a total of seventy four Annotators in total. We gave each of them two hundred texts or two hundred short conversations and we also put extra questions to use as attention check for quality control so on average we got five annotations for each short conversation.

This is how the annotation interface looks like. It's very simple it resembles a chat or a text interface they see a text message and its reply and then there is just a question below which asks is the reply ironic with respect to the context and the Annotator can choose ironic or not ironic observed some differences between several groups along different dimensions depending on how we divide the DataSets but whether we divide the Annotators by gender by age group nationality and so on we found something peculiar that is that in the case of age it is generations that are close to each other that seem to be more in disagreement towards their perception of irony and similar things happen in the geographical distribution of the Annotators where we found that the highest variations in response is given between the two models trained on labels given by Annotators from the United Kingdom and Ireland.</sample>

    <sample id="322">The text classifier learns about morality by understanding how it is expressed differently across different domains, such as politics, social issues, and cultural norms. Language models can recognize that morality can be expressed in various ways, including words like "overthrow" and "subversion", which carry negative connotations, and words like "frothed upon" and "encouraged", which carry positive connotations.

In this paper, the authors aim to explore how language models understand morality in different domains using a dataset called Morality Twitter corpus composed of 35,000 Tweets collected in seven different domains, including #AllLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter. They found that language models can recognize that morality can be expressed differently in each domain, but also that there are differences in the way morality is expressed between these two domains.

The authors propose a method to analyze the differences in morality expression between these two domains, which involves analyzing the frequency of certain words and phrases used in each domain. They also suggest that language models should be trained on multiple datasets to capture the nuances of morality expression across different domains.

Overall, the paper aims to provide insights into how language models understand morality in different contexts and to identify potential biases or limitations in their ability to capture moral nuance.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The results of the experiments on Compose Qa and OpenQa compared with RLM and HkG are as follows:

* The results show that Compose Qa is more accurate than RLM and HkG in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
* The results also show that Compose Qa is more robust to variations in the input data, such as different types of entities and relationships.
* However, Compose Qa requires more computational resources than RLM and HkG, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Overall, the results suggest that Compose Qa is a better choice than RLM and HkG for tasks involving complex entity recognition and relationship extraction, but it may require more computational resources and expertise to implement effectively.</sample>

    <sample id="325">The experimental results show that our model outperforms other treeless models on the Cogswell benchmark by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion. Some other kinds of structural Generalization remain very challenging, though. In our paper, we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges. First of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token, which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple Permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is late. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training. Our Permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is N P hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem.</sample>

    <sample id="350">The meaning of superhuman performance in today's NLP is that some tasks are now solved by these models, however although we know that it's easy for example for a calculator to perform humans with arithmetic tasks it's still not clear what it means to perform humans in tasks involving knowledge reasoning and inference. Additionally research on NLP often dudly estimate human performance indeed the term human baseline is often used and it seems to imply that systems need to beat it specifically simple calculation methods such as average or majority voting are used instead it would be interesting to compare the scores of the best systems with that of the best possible humans like it is done in other areas of artificial intelligence however even assuming that the score of the best human in the pool is reported can we be sure that it would be comparable with that of the best possible human in general and by analyzing the benchmarks we discovered that pay rates vary considerably across the various tests and in some cases these are very low such as three point six dollars per hour in record or even unknown in particular if humans are not adequately motivated the resulting quality will be low and we argue that this data is constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human to system comparisons.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" is a research topic that aims to address the challenge of input under specification in code generation, particularly when dealing with missing key operations. The authors propose a method to generate code by asking clarification questions, which can help gather more information about specifications and alleviate the problem of under specification.

The proposed pipeline includes:

1. A question selector to select relevant questions based on the code knowledge graph.
2. A generator to generate code from the selected questions.
3. A predictor to predict the correctness of the generated code.
4. A classifier to classify the predicted code as correct or incorrect.

The authors also discuss potential improvements, such as using taxonomies to distinguish between line operations and non-line operations, and using annotations to annotate the validation set and test set.

However, the authors note that their approach has some limitations, including:

* It may require additional training data to fine-tune the models.
* It may not be able to handle complex scenarios where multiple predictions need to be made simultaneously.

Overall, the authors conclude that their approach is a good starting point for addressing the challenge of input under specification in code generation, but further research is needed to improve its performance and scalability.</sample>
