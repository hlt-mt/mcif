    <sample id="3">We have fine tuned two different models to produce document level simplifications and we also fine tuned the normal base long the normal base part to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we proposed those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future.</sample>

    <sample id="5">The accuracy is around eighty two to eighty seven percent but this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between eighty two to eighty seven percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only sixty percent so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain general here is a link to our dataset thanks</sample>

    <sample id="9">Recent WSL approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done well clean validation samples second WSL approaches should be compared with short learning baseline as both work on clean samples third continuous fine tuning is a simple strong baseline that should be considered in future work in WSL finally we have open source our code you can find it via the Q R code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoying the conference</sample>
    <sample id="10">The accuracy is around ninety two to ninety five percent but this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between eighty two to eighty seven percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only sixty percent so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain general here is a link to our data set thanks</sample>

    <sample id="13">The sweet spot analysis is a method used to improve the inference time of large language models by reducing the number of samples required to make predictions. It involves training multiple models with different architectures, each using a different set of parameters, and then combining their outputs to produce a single prediction.

In this paper, we present a novel fine-tuning method for early exit architectures, which we call "sweet spot". We train an early exit architecture where each layer receives updates only from the following classifier that means we avoid the conflict in gradient problem completely. 

We evaluate our method on individual layers and find that it closes most of the gap between early exit and multi-model. However, in some cases later classifiers are negatively affected by our method as you can see here by the negative gap between sweet spot and early exit. We also ran a test and examined the speed accuracy tradeoff. We can see here that in fast speeds sweet outperforms both methods where for Burt large it outperforms both methods throughout the entire speed accuracy curve. The takeaway from our work are as follows we show the existence of conflict in gradient in early exit training process to the best of our knowledge we do the first fair comparison of early exit and multi-model adaptive inference methods we also introduced the sweet spot the results of which motivate future research of fine tuning algorithms tailored to the early exit architecture thank you very much for listening if you enjoyed the talk and you want to see more go visit our paper on Archive finding the sweet spot.</sample>

    <sample id="15">There are no specific authors mentioned in the text, but based on the context of the paper, it appears that the authors are likely to be researchers in the field of natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning.</sample>
    <sample id="16">The second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine tuning language models to produce simplified text from complex input text. We have fine tuned two different models, one for long part to produce document level simplifications and another for normal base part to produce sentence level simplifications.</sample>

    <sample id="27">It seems like you've provided a lengthy response, but I'll focus on answering your specific question.

To evaluate the political bias of language models, we can use various metrics such as:

1. **Bias Index**: This measures the difference between the predicted probability of a word being biased (e.g., hateful) and its actual probability.
2. **Bias Score**: This is a weighted sum of the biases detected by different language models.
3. **Diversity Metrics**: These measure the variety of words and phrases used in the training data, which can indicate the model's ability to capture diverse perspectives.

We can also use techniques like **word embeddings** to analyze the semantic meaning of words and detect biases.

Regarding the role of pre-training data in detecting biases, it's essential to note that pre-training data alone may not be sufficient to detect biases. However, incorporating diverse pre-training datasets can help improve the robustness of the final model.

To investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models, we should consider the following steps:

1. Collect diverse pre-training datasets with labeled examples of biased and non-biased text.
2. Train multiple language models using these datasets.
3. Evaluate each model's performance on a separate test set.
4. Analyze the results to identify potential biases in the models.

By doing so, we can gain insights into how language models learn from pre-training data and detect biases in downstream tasks.

    <sample id="29">We find that context aware models have the best performance but then if we use comit, contextual models perform better and if we use word measure then models with or without context have comparable performance this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use corpus level Metrics alone now we use the benchmark to evaluate models and we find that contextual models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context on certain discurso phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that did not use context on other phenomena like ellipses pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that Deep is usually more accurate than Google translate for document level translation to summarize</sample>

    <sample id="34">Crest is a joint framework for selective rationalization and counterfactual text generation, which provides explanations by highlighting input tokens in a faithful way. It combines methods that leverage their complementary strengths, such as automatic metrics and human evaluation. The proposed approach involves training on data sets with different setups, including only factual examples, then performing data augmentation using human counterfactors or counterfactual generated by Crest, and finally leveraging these counterfactuals during training to produce plausible explanations that focus on the contrastive parts of the input.

The results show that Crest performs well on par with other methods, especially when compared to data augmentation using human counterfactors. This suggests that Crest can be used to improve downstream models by providing more accurate and diverse explanations. Overall, the proposed approach leverages Crest's ability to generate high-quality counterfactuals while controlling the quality of the explanations produced by the model.</sample>

    <sample id="63">La sensibilità della metrica è un termine che si riferisce al grado di accuratezza o di precisione con cui un modello può raggiungere una determinata misura o risultato. In questo caso, la sensibilità della metrica è stata misurata utilizzando un modello di grandi dimensioni e un set di dati multi-modale.

Il modello di grandi dimensioni utilizzato in questa ricerca è stato un modello di grandi dimensioni pre-trattato (OFA) che ha ricevuto un grande numero di esperimenti per valutare la sua capacità di raggiungere diverse misure. La sensibilità del modello è stata misurata attraverso l'uso di diversi metodi di valutazione, tra cui:

* Valutazione dei risultati: il modello ha prodotto risultati accurati su diversi dati.
* Valutazione della varietà dei dati: il modello ha prodotto risultati accurati su diversi dati.
* Valutazione della consistenza dei risultati: il modello ha prodotto risultati accurati su diversi dati.

In generale, il modello di grandi dimensioni ha mostrato una sensibilità significativa nella misurazione delle sue capacità di raggiungere diverse misure. Tuttavia, è importante notare che la sensibilità del modello dipende anche dalla natura dei dati utilizzati e dalle specifiche esigenze del problema.

In questo caso, abbiamo utilizzato un set di dati multi-modale che comprende diversi tipi di dati, tra cui dati linguistici, immagini e dati di bounding box. Il modello di grandi dimensioni ha mostrato una sensibilità significativa nella misurazione delle sue capacità di raggiungere diverse misure, comprese:

* Raccolta di dati linguistici: il modello ha prodotto risultati accurati su diversi dati linguistici.
* Raccolta di dati immagini: il modello ha prodotto risultati accurati su diversi dati immagini.
* Raccolta di dati di bounding box: il modello ha prodotto risultati accurati su diversi dati di bounding box.

In sintesi, il modello di grandi dimensioni ha mostrato una sensibilità significativa nella misurazione delle sue capacità di raggiungere diverse misure, ma è importante considerare le specifiche esigenze del problema e gli altri fattori che possono influenzare la sensibilità del modello.</sample>

    <sample id="74">The code snippet provided appears to be related to the development of a deep learning model, specifically a neural network architecture called "Dense-Connect". This architecture is designed to improve the performance of models by incorporating multiple layers of dense connections between different parts of the network.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It defines two classes `DenseNode` and `DenseLayer`, which represent individual nodes and layers within the network.
2. The `DenseNode` class has attributes such as `id`, `input_size`, `output_size`, and `activation_function`. These attributes define the input size, output size, and activation function used for each node.
3. The `DenseLayer` class inherits from `DenseNode` and adds additional methods for computing the output of the layer based on its inputs.
4. The `compute_output` method takes an input tensor and computes the output of the layer using the specified activation function.
5. The `DenseNetwork` class represents the entire network, with methods for training, inference, and evaluation.

Some key points about this code snippet include:

* The use of dense connections (also known as fully connected layers) between different parts of the network to improve performance.
* The incorporation of multiple layers of dense connections to create a hierarchical structure that can learn complex patterns in data.
* The use of activation functions such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) to introduce non-linearity into the model.
* The ability to compute outputs for multiple inputs simultaneously using the `compute_output` method.

Overall, this code snippet provides a solid foundation for building a deep learning model with dense connections, and demonstrates how to incorporate multiple layers of dense connections to improve performance.</sample>
    <sample id="75">The joint learning framework consists of four parts: 
1. Span feature generation, 
2. Heterogeneous graph construction, 
3. Joint label propagation, and 
4. Model optimization.

For span feature generation we suppose xk is the contextualized representation of the k input token. We initialize spans as a H in a H R from the labeled tokens we obtain a train classifier on the base model using the train classifier we generate the labels and use the soft max function followed by a standard mass operation to determine the labels we filter those of lower quality with the confidence G and combine the rest of the confidence above threshold with the label data to retrain the classification model the retraining model remains the same as the baseline model as this joint and I classification function finally the experiment part was conducted our experiments on four datasets that are joint task sets and single task datasets there is no previous baseline on semi supervised joint task comparisons are only made with base model performance.</sample>
    <sample id="76">It appears you've provided a lengthy response, but I'll focus on answering your specific question.

To evaluate the political leanings of language models, we can use various metrics such as:

1. **Bias detection algorithms**: These algorithms can identify biased language patterns, such as hate speech, misinformation, or discriminatory language.
2. **Sentiment analysis**: This involves analyzing the sentiment expressed in text data, which can indicate whether it's positive, negative, or neutral towards a particular topic or group.
3. **Topic modeling**: This technique helps identify underlying topics or themes in large datasets, which can reveal biases or prejudices present in the language.

Some popular tools for evaluating language model bias include:

* **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A pre-trained language model that has been shown to be effective in detecting bias.
* **RoBERTa**: An improved version of BERT that also includes a bias detection module.
* **Word2Vec**: A simple word embedding model that can be used to detect bias by analyzing the distribution of words in a dataset.

When evaluating language models, it's essential to consider their training data, architecture, and fine-tuning process. For example, if a language model is trained on a dataset with a predominantly liberal or conservative tone, it may exhibit biases towards those groups.

Regarding the role of pre-training data in language model bias, it's true that pre-training can introduce biases into the model. However, this can be mitigated through fine-tuning and post-processing techniques, such as:

* **Data augmentation**: Adding diverse data to the training set to reduce the impact of biases introduced during pre-training.
* **Post-processing**: Applying techniques like debiasing or retraining the model on a new dataset to remove existing biases.

In conclusion, evaluating the political leanings of language models requires a combination of metrics, algorithms, and techniques to detect bias. By considering these factors, researchers and developers can create more fair and inclusive language models.</sample>

The watermark should be converted enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily. Finally, the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either not applicable to Embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor based watermark method that is applicable to Embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embeddings contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the results on four data sets show that our embedding marker can have great detection performance while keep great utility for down stream tasks we also validated the convertness of the provided Embedding by visualizing the Embedding of sentences for data set the legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor Embedding and normal Embedding that's all thank you will come to discuss with us</sample>

We follow the method from OFA and formulate all the tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format in which the input text, images, instruction, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space.

Our main results as we can see instruction tuning can significantly improve overall performance on multi-model tasks also transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can benefit instruction tuning. Here we can see as the amount of task increased the model achieve better performance and in the meantime lower sensitivity. So we also did one experiment using one instruction versus five instructions as we can see using more instructions can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot so this shows the effect of different fine tuning strategy on the model's sensitivity as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction datasets the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original model.</sample>

    <sample id="135">The ABCEval approach is designed to evaluate conversational AI models by explicitly annotating whether each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information, contradicting itself, or its partner. This approach aims to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by providing a more objective measure of chat model behavior.

ABCEval measures the proportion of turns where a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant, contradicts itself, or its partner. It also evaluates the consistency of the model's responses using a stepwise linear regression analysis. The combination of all these metrics explains over twenty five percent of conversation quality.

In contrast, existing methods like Lickert ratings on the turn level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons only capture a limited amount of information about the quality of the conversation. These methods may lose valuable information when removing them one at a time, resulting in a loss of context.

By leveraging ABCEval, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how conversational AI models behave and improve their overall performance. This approach has the potential to be applied in various fields, including customer service, language translation, and virtual assistants.</sample>

    <sample id="146">The task of analyzing the omission problem in dialogue summarization is challenging due to its complexity and variability. The omission problem refers to the missing content in the generated summaries, which can be caused by various factors such as noise, ambiguity, or incomplete information.

To address this challenge, we propose an automated method to produce omission labels for candidate summaries. We use a combination of pre-trained language models and decoding strategies to generate diverse candidates. Our approach involves:

1. Pre-training multiple language models on different domains to capture various patterns and structures.
2. Using these pre-trained models to generate candidate summaries.
3. Applying post-editing techniques to refine the summaries based on detected omissions.
4. Evaluating the quality of the refined summaries using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Our results show that incorporating omitted information into the summary generation process improves the overall performance. Specifically, we find that the inclusion of omitted information increases the precision of the summaries by around 50% compared to the baseline model.

Furthermore, our approach demonstrates that the omission detection task is valuable and can lead to significant improvements in dialogue summarization. By providing accurate omission labels, we can improve the quality of the summaries and enhance their usefulness in real-world applications.

Overall, our work highlights the importance of addressing the omission problem in dialogue summarization and provides a promising direction for future research in this area.</sample>

The first module for our proposal is the proposition generator, which generates simple propositions from complex reasoning tasks. This module can see that the problem is solvable if it has an appropriate model and the model is able to solve the problem. 

The second module for our proposal is the logical operator conjunction operation, which combines two simple propositions into a single proposition. This operation is similar to the self-asking chain of thoughts, but it is more efficient because it avoids the need to recursively apply the same reasoning task multiple times.

Finally, we combine the inference result of the first module with the final solution obtained by the second module to obtain the final solution of the complex reasoning task. This approach allows us to integrate the advantages of both modules and construct a reasoning system that is effective for solving complex problems.</sample>

    <sample id="169">The paper "Praming for Translation" is a joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate, presented last year at the NLP conference in 2022. It's a five hundred forty billion parameter model that achieved state-of-the-art performance in hundreds of NLP tasks.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation. We evaluated the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the MPT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model, and comparing two state-of-the-art systems, the best performing systems of the MPT evaluation.

We used state-of-the-art metrics and also showed expert-based human evaluation results. Finally, we provided some recommendations for prompt selection strategies. The prompting has a big influence on the performance of the LLMs for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one shot prompting and provided two different prompts for each sentence. The majority of sentences five hundred sixteen out of one thousand the difference observed is of more than one blur points and this can go in extreme cases up to forty blur points so it's important to select a good prompting strategy in our experiments we chose for a five shot prompting strategy where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in this example here where we perform translation from German into English the German sentences are marked with German column and the English translations with English column we saw that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have a big influence in the case of several short prompting it seems that palm chooses them to produce a better sand translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are made in the translation however the style category for palm is lower than for the state of the art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much.</sample>

We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our Permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is N P hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a G P friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible Permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we addressed these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to a poster.</sample>
    <sample id="176">It appears you've provided a lengthy response, but I'll focus on answering your specific question.

To evaluate the political bias of language models, we can use various metrics such as:

1. **Bias Index**: A measure that calculates the difference between the predicted probability of a word being biased (e.g., hate speech) and its actual probability.
2. **Bias Score**: A numerical value that represents the degree of bias in the model's predictions.
3. **Fairness Metrics**: Such as the F1-score, which measures the proportion of correct predictions versus incorrect ones.

These metrics can help identify potential biases in language models. For example, if a model predicts a high percentage of hate speech words, it may indicate a strong bias towards promoting hate speech.

Regarding the role of pre-training data in identifying political bias, it's essential to note that pre-training data is just one aspect of the overall process. Other factors, such as fine-tuning on downstream tasks, can also contribute to bias.

To investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models, we should consider the following steps:

1. Collect diverse pre-training data with varying levels of bias.
2. Fine-tune each dataset on different downstream tasks to assess their performance.
3. Compare the results across datasets to identify patterns and correlations.
4. Use fairness metrics to quantify the bias in each model's predictions.

By taking these steps, we can gain insights into how pre-training data influences the development of language models and whether they perpetuate existing biases.

    <sample id="179">We have performed experiments with a variety of large language models, including GPT-3 model and textual time travel which is a model specifically designed for theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models we analyzed in domain performance in the well known Tomi dataset and we evaluated robustness with two out of box datasets that we designed giving for example a forty two point accuracy boost for that one so in conclusion we introduced symbolic Tom a play method to improve theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models it is an inference time algorithm which avoids overfitting risk it uses explicit graphical symbolic representation Which yields more interpretable reasoning and symbolic Tom dramatically improves out-of-the-box LLM performance on performing supervised approaches on out of the box story understanding and remaining beneficial on the new linguistic diversity data set paraphrase Tomi for more details please refer to the paper and don't hesitate to reach out to chat thank you so much for listening.</sample>

    <sample id="184">We find that context is used to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexicon cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipses pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that Debel is usually more accurate than Google Translate for document level translation to summarize</sample>

To address this challenge, we propose a low framework that utilizes knowledge from K B and text co-sets to simulate the realistic case where K B is incomplete. We use Wikipedia as a supplementary text corpus and music as a supplemental text set. The result is an improvement over the R O H T method, demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing knowledge from K B and text co-sets.</sample>

    <sample id="206">It appears you have provided a large amount of text related to your research on cognitive dissonance, transfer learning, and active learning. However, I will attempt to extract the main points from this text.

The text discusses the importance of understanding cognitive dissonance in language, which is defined as two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent (e.g., "I know that cigarettes could kill me" and "I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting"). The author also mentions that they used a combination of transfer learning and active learning to improve their performance on tasks related to cognitive dissonance.

They found that using a probability of rare class strategy improved their performance compared to other strategies, such as iterative updates across the board. They also found that the proposed PRC strategy works better than other state-of-the-art strategies.

However, the text does not provide further details about the specific implementation of these strategies or how they were tested. It seems that the author is looking for feedback or guidance on how to apply these concepts in practice.

If you would like to continue discussing the topic or need help with anything else, please let me know.</sample>

    <sample id="233">The attention mechanism is used to selectively focus on certain words in the input speech stream, allowing the model to attend to specific parts of the sentence while ignoring others. This can be useful for tasks such as machine translation where the model needs to understand the context of the sentence but may not need to understand every word.

In the case of simultaneous speech translation, the attention mechanism is used to selectively focus on the most relevant words in the input speech stream, allowing the model to translate the sentence accurately. The attention weights are calculated based on the similarity between the input words and the target words, with higher weights indicating that the input words are more similar to the target words.

The proposed solution uses a dot product attention mechanism, which calculates the dot product of the input features with the target features. This allows the model to weigh the importance of each feature in the input speech stream when generating the output. The attention weights are then used to select the most relevant words from the input speech stream and generate the output.

The results show that the proposed solution outperforms all other strategies applied to offline models since it considers the actual elapsed time and computational awareness time, and that it is the fastest strategy.</sample>

    <sample id="252">The performance of event-based models, such as BERT and Distilbert, has been found to be significantly lower compared to the previous transformer models in the prior case retrieval task. This highlights the complexities and nuances of the legal domain and the need for tailored approaches.

In our work, we have conducted experiments using diverse range of models to validate and compare their performance on the PCR task. These models are categorized into three groups: count based models which are applied on the world level, transformer based models and finally the event based models which provide various approaches for improving PCR performance.

We present the best performing model within each grouping and observe that event based models have lower inference time and higher f1 score compared to the other techniques. Here is a performance comparison on the CoLi dataset, you create outperformed the existing approaches including the recent supervised approach by MTF team to the best of our knowledge this approach is a current state of the art method for the CoLi twenty one document retrieval task.</sample>

The answers tend to have a more negative meaning or psychological orientation compared to Birt take for example the sentence "I used to be able to cry where we mask the word cry" and the answers predict words like focus, talk, breath, sleep and eat which are related to common problems that are associated with mental disorders and cause an interference in the thinking and behavior of the affected person.</sample>
    <sample id="254">We observe that the distribution of uncertainty scores for each relation class is different, Moreover, it can be observed that frequent classes usually contain more lower average uncertainty than the long tail class. So we propose dynamic class uncertainty thresholds to filter out the threshold levels with high uncertainty. The calculation can be seen in this formulation. Then we replace the original Ds label with the pseudo label that contains a lower uncertainty score than its class uncertainty threshold. In order to take full advantage of the Ds data for posting the performance of Docker model, we design the multi phase training strategy to iteratively relabel the Ds data which is shown in this algorithm. We compare our framework with several strong base lines on two public datasets as shown in this table, our framework outperforms the previous base lines on both two datasets in conclusion the main contribution of our work is summarized as those four points the first one is our framework With uncertainty guided label denoising which greatly improves the label quality of the data the second one is the instance level uncertainty estimation method for overlapping relations the third one is the reactive relabelling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty threshold for the long term problem the last one is the great performance improvement.</sample>

    <sample id="264">The proposed approach is based on the idea of using a combination of models, including an RNN-based model and a transformer-based model, to generate audio content from text data. The RNN-based model can be used to generate sequential data such as text, while the transformer-based model can be used to generate non-sequence data such as images.

In this approach, we first use the RNN-based model to generate sequential data such as text, which can then be used as input to the transformer-based model. The transformer-based model can then be used to generate non-sequence data such as images, which can also be used as input to the RNN-based model.

We have built two benchmark based on MMSVDT and MMSVDT including cross data set and cross domain setting. We have also evaluated our approach by comparing it with other approaches, including the RNN-based model and the transformer-based model.

Our results show that our approach outperforms these other approaches in terms of accuracy and quality of generated audio content. This suggests that our approach has potential for generating high-quality audio content from text data.

Next, I would like to present to you the main results of our experiments. To best of our knowledge, there is no work invested in transferable video generation so we first choose the Sota approach including the RNN-based model and the transformer-based model not for full compression so that we can train our model on the meta training set without the same model and test on the target domain as seen it can be observed only on most of the materials by a large machine

    <sample id="277">Our model outperforms other treeless models on the Coggs benchmark by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion some other kinds of structural Generalization remain very challenging though in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which MultiSet it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple Permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is late. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our Permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is N P hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a G P friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible Permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we addressed these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to a poster.</sample>

    <sample id="284">The results of our experiments show that Fsa improves convergence speed by guiding the model to obtain a reasonable attention distribution. Fsa enables the model to fully utilize an information and obtain a greater information extraction capability, the combined effect of the two will produce a greater enhancement we also visualized the attention distribution of a f s I attention layer result shows that the model focused on semantic information within a limited range of preceding tokens this meets our expectations in conclusion in this work we first proposed a new Fis span law that alleviates the model's reliance on span boundaries and then we proposed efficient Fis span attention to adaptively adjusting the attention span of model and the Fs U I we proposed achieve excellent results in a wide range of tasks thank you for your listening.</sample>

    <sample id="296">The data was collected from different sources, including social media, Reddit, and Twitter, spanning a long time window of one and a half years. The data consisted of about three hundred short conversations made up of pairs of text one following the other. We repeated this process for both sources and for five varieties of English which are listed here. 

We used the crowd sourcing platform Prolicific to have people annotate this data. We selected about fifteen Annotators for each of the English language varieties for a total of seventy four Annotators in total. We gave each of them two hundred texts or two hundred short conversations and we also put extra questions to use as attention check for quality control so on average we got five annotations for each short conversation.

This is how the annotation interface looks like. It's very simple it resembles a chat or a text interface they see a text message and its reply and then there is just a question below which asks is the reply ironic with respect to the context and the Annotator can choose ironic or not ironic observed some differences between several groups along different dimensions depending on how we divide the DataSets but whether we divide the Annotators by gender by age group nationality and so on we found something peculiar that is that in the case of age it is generations that are close to each other that seem to be more in disagreement towards their perception of irony and similar things happen in the geographical distribution of the Annotators where we found that the highest variations in response is given between the two models trained on labels given by Annotators from the United Kingdom and Ireland.</sample>

    <sample id="317">The proposed approach using code language models and code format prompts significantly outperformed traditional baseline models such as UIE and natural language like large language models, the GPT model. We further conducted a detailed and in-depth analysis of this phenomenon. Firstly, we observed that the complexity computed on test formats using models like T5 was generally higher than that of code format inputs using models like CodeT5. This suggests that the use of code format prompts can lead to better performance in information extraction tasks.

Moreover, we observed that when decoding with GPT-3 and test format prompts there were many structural errors whereas when using CodeT5 and code format prompts such errors were almost non-existent. This indicates that the use of code format prompts can help mitigate these errors and improve overall performance.

We also analyzed that using GPT-3 for information extraction tasks often resulted in fewer structural errors compared to using CodeT5 for information extraction tasks. This is likely due to the fact that GPT-3 uses a more complex architecture that allows it to handle longer input sequences and extract more accurate information.

Furthermore, we found that the use of code format prompts can be particularly useful in cases where the input data is highly structured or has a specific format. In such cases, the use of code format prompts can help the model to accurately extract the relevant information from the input data.

Overall, our analysis suggests that the use of code format prompts can be a valuable tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction tasks, especially when working with complex or structured input data.</sample>

    <sample id="322">The text classifier learns about morality by understanding how it is expressed differently across different domains, such as politics, social issues, and cultural norms. Language models can recognize that morality can be expressed in various ways, including words like "overthrow" and "subversion", which carry negative connotations, and words like "mayhem" and "subversion", which carry positive connotations.

The paper proposes a method to understand morality in text using Explainable AI techniques, specifically focusing on the moral foundation theory. This theory suggests that there are five different ways in which humans perceive morality, each with its own moral foundation. The authors use a dataset called Morality Twitter Corpus, composed of 35,000 tweets collected in seven different domains, to explore these differences.

They found that language models can understand that morality is expressed differently in different domains, but may not always capture the nuances of human morality. For example, they discovered that while some domains, like politics, express morality through strong rhetoric, others, like social issues, express morality through more subtle language.

The authors also found that language models may not always prioritize the same moral foundations when expressing morality in different domains. They propose a method to address this issue by training language models to understand the moral implications of their expressions and to provide explanations for why certain actions or concepts are considered morally wrong.

Overall, the paper aims to demonstrate that language models can learn to understand morality in text and provide insights into how morality is expressed differently across different domains.</sample>
    <sample id="323">We have obtained the results on the later parts of the Compose Qa and OpenQa compared with RLM and HkG, which we report below.

The results show that the results from the later parts of the Compose Qa and OpenQa are generally better than those from RLM and HkG. This is because the later parts of these models use more advanced techniques such as graph embedding and attention mechanisms, which allow them to capture more complex relationships between entities and their contexts.

In particular, the results show that the graph-based approach outperforms the text-based approach in terms of accuracy and recall. The graph-based approach also shows better performance in terms of F1-score, which measures the proportion of correct predictions among all predicted instances.

Overall, our results suggest that graph-based approaches can be effective in capturing complex relationships between entities and their contexts, and can provide better performance than text-based approaches in certain tasks. However, further research is needed to fully explore the strengths and limitations of these approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="324">Language models with different political leanings do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social category there are a bunch of more examples in Appendix to further highlight that this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models for example if a right leaning language model were to be fine tuned on hate speech or misinformation or whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and hate speech targeting minority groups just run rampant without any control so this has sounds the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political biases it's like between Selya and Cribes so if we do not Sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias will propagate from pre training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we will also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language modeling data so it's kind of like you like electrically problem OK great I think that's pretty much all I have for today thank you for your time</sample>

The X exercise is the index of the UniModal expert and the legend shows the index of the cross-model layer we first take a look at static managers no matter the texture or visual role a similar progressive trend are shown in each cross-model layer which is inconsistent with the intuition that the need for Unimodal semantic knowledge varies among cross-model layers.</sample>

    <sample id="329">The most predicted confidence is the highest value of the IoU (Intersection over Union) metric, which indicates how well the model has captured the object in the image. The IoU metric measures the overlap between the predicted object and the ground truth object, while the IoU metric measures the intersection area between the predicted object and the ground truth object.

In this case, we use the IoU metric to evaluate the performance of our zero-shot model on the dataset. We calculate the IoU metric for each prediction and select the one with the highest IoU value as the best model for that round of training.

We also use the SLP (Spatial Labeling Protocol) to represent our model's predictions as spatial labels, which allows us to compare them with other models. This protocol involves assigning spatial labels to each pixel in the image based on the predicted object's location.

By using SLP, we can reduce the influence of label noise in our model by eliminating the need to predict the labels for each pixel individually. Instead, we assign spatial labels to each pixel based on the predicted object's location, which helps to improve the overall performance of our model.

Finally, we use the SLP to retrain our model on the dataset, which enables us to achieve better zero-shot performance compared to other methods. By retraining our model on the dataset, we can leverage the knowledge gained from the training data to improve the performance of our model on unseen data.</sample>
    <sample id="330">It appears you have provided a lengthy response that does not directly address your question about whether Active Learning is beneficial for transfer learning on Dissonance detection.

To provide an accurate answer:

Active Learning (AL) is a technique used in machine learning to select the most informative samples from a dataset to be labeled by a human expert. It can be particularly useful when dealing with datasets where the number of available labels is limited.

Transfer Learning (TL) is a type of deep learning where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new task. The effectiveness of TL depends on various factors such as the quality of the pre-trained model, the complexity of the new task, and the amount of data available for training.

Cognitive Dissonance refers to the phenomenon where individuals experience discomfort or tension due to conflicting beliefs or actions. In the context of language processing, cognitive dissonance might arise when a person holds two contradictory views, such as "I know I should quit smoking but then I smoke anyway."

The proposed approach involves using Active Learning to select the most informative samples from a dataset to be labeled by a human expert. This can help improve the performance of Transfer Learning on Dissonance detection tasks.

However, it's essential to note that the effectiveness of AL in this specific case may depend on the quality of the pre-trained model, the complexity of the new task, and the amount of data available for training.

    <sample id="336">Crossling semantic parsing is a task to build semantic representations of user queries such as SQL and Lambda calculus, and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations.

As shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to SQL Lambda or PRT and we also evaluate on multilingual language models such as Codas and blue are still in decent for Crossling semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and mean representations conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of language models and our results shows many interesting findings and et cetera and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for lessening in modo conciso alla seguente domanda dato il contenuto inglese: Cos'è il trasferimento interlinguistico?</sample>

    <sample id="343">The main takeaway of our paper is that many Co-Reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task specific training, however with task specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrated background knowledge presented only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="344">Our model outperforms other treeless models on the Coggs benchmark by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion some other kinds of structural Generalization remain very challenging though in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which Multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple Permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is late. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our Permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is N P hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a G P friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible Permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we addressed these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to a poster.</sample>

    <sample id="350">The meaning of superhuman performance in today's NLP is that some tasks are now solved by these models, however although we know that it's easy for example for a calculator to perform humans with arithmetic tasks it's still not clear what it means to perform humans in tasks involving knowledge reasoning and inference. Additionally research on NLP often dudly estimate human performance indeed the term human baseline is often used and it seems to imply that systems need to beat it specifically simple calculation methods such as average or majority voting are used instead it would be interesting to compare the scores of the best systems with that of the best possible humans like it is done in other areas of artificial intelligence however even assuming that the score of the best human in the pool is reported can we be sure that it would be comparable with that of the best possible human in general and by analyzing the benchmarks we discovered that pay rates vary considerably across the various tests and in some cases these are very low such as three point six dollars per hour in record or even unknown in particular if humans are not adequately motivated the resulting quality will be low and we argue that this data is constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human to system comparisons.</sample>

    <sample id="352">ABC-Eval is capable of measuring the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors for example, a B C eval measures the number of turns with self and partner contradictions explains five percent and ten percent of conversation quality respectively while the average Lickert consistency scores explain only four percent or less finally we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression you can see how the combination of all ABC Metrics explains over twenty five percent of conversation quality and as you remove the Metrics one at a time most of them result in losing a decent amount of information about the quality on the other hand the combination of all turn level Lickert Metrics explains far less of the quality and fewer of these Metrics carry unique information these reliable informative and distinct A C Eval Metrics enable us to evaluate conversational ai with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve you can see that in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified for example the bots we tested have common sense violations in around twenty five percent of their responses they produce irrelevant information in around fifteen percent of the responses and they contradict themselves or their partner around ten percent of the time with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation Metrics for comparing models we hope ABC-Eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching.</sample>
    <sample id="353">We have proposed a method to generate code by asking clarification questions which is a synthetic dataset with clarifications on key operations and we propose a pipeline of the CQa that includes a prediction, a question selector and a generator and we have the model experiment results we actually have two hypotheses that first our task is more challenging the existing Squeaking result and we also have the hypothesis that Clarification helps CQ generation which is supported by the CQ generation results we also test our pipeline we see that the most performances of all evaluation metrics including high rank C Qs being answered and included increases however there's an opposite trend of unanswered Clarification at the same time our pipeline is still underperforming the model only training CQa and CQ ranking task is a challenge then at the end we do some analysis the first thing is do the clarified key operations the reason for better generation codes and similarly yes we also give some example of predictions and see that training Oracle CQa list prediction close to ground truth with only minor differences however the test is challenging as the top five rank C Qs do not include C Qs in the reference C Qas leading to the pipeline prediction including a confusion matrix but missing the classes mentioned here so thank you for listening and please check out our paper and code and we are looking for your feedback</sample>

    <sample id="356">The authors of the paper are discussing Compositional Generalization without trees using Multi-Set Tagging and Latent Permutations, which is a method for handling out-of-distribution generalization in machine learning models.

They mention that their approach involves tagging each input token with an unordered multi-set of tokens that will appear in the output after the first step, and then using another model to predict the permutation to put them into the right order.

They also discuss some technical challenges they faced during training, such as aligning the input and output data, and finding the highest scoring permutation. They address these challenges by introducing an alignment as part of the training process.

However, they do not provide further details on the specific results of their experiments, nor do they give more information about how they propose to solve these challenges.</sample>

    <sample id="358">We found that context aware models have the best performance but then if we use comit, contextual models perform best and if we use word measure then models with or without context have comparable performance this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use corpus level Metrics alone now we use the benchmark to evaluate models and we find that contextual models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain disourses such as formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that did not use context on other disourses like ellipses pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that Debel is usually more accurate than Google translate for document level translation to summarize</sample>
