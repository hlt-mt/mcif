    <sample id="8">Annotating behaviors in chat or A B Eval in short we developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature as shown by simple linear regression analysis for example you can see how measuring the proportion of turns with self and partner contradictions explains five percent and ten percent of conversation quality respectively while the average Lickert consistency scores explain only four percent or less finally we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression you can see how the combination of all ABC Metrics explains over twenty five percent of conversation quality and as you remove the Metrics one at a time most of them result in losing a decent amount of information about the quality on the other hand the combination of all turn level Lickert Metrics explains far less of the quality and fewer of these Metrics carry unique information these reliable informative and distinct A B Eval Metrics enable us to evaluate conversational ai with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve you can see that in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified for example the bots we tested have common sense violations in around twenty five percent of their responses they produce irrelevant information in around fifteen percent of the responses and they contradict themselves or their partner around ten percent of the time with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation Metrics for comparing models we hope ABCEval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="25">The experiment was designed to investigate the effect of position on the governor's influence in the coordination structure. The experiment consisted of two sentences with different positions of the governor (left and right) and asked participants to read them out loud.

    <sample id="73">Der Referent in</sample>
    <sample id="74">The code snippet provided appears to be related to graph theory, specifically dealing with the concept of "deterministic graphs" (denomination) and "multihop paths". 

Deterministic graphs refer to graphs where every path from an initial node to a target node can be uniquely determined by traversing the nodes in a specific order. This is often used in algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm.

Multihop paths refer to paths that traverse multiple edges between two nodes before reaching their destination. These paths are useful in scenarios where the shortest path may involve traversing through intermediate nodes.

In this context, the code snippet seems to be implementing a deterministic graph traversal using multihop paths. It defines a function `deterministic_graph` which takes a graph as input and returns a list of all possible paths from the initial node to the target node.

Here's a simplified version of how it could work:

```python
def deterministic_graph(graph):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the adjacency list of the graph
    adj_list = {}
    
    # Populate the adjacency list
    for node in graph:
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in adj_list:
                adj_list[neighbor] = []
            adj_list[neighbor].append(node)
    
    # Define a recursive function to perform DFS
    def dfs(current_node, current_path):
        # Add the current node to the path
        current_path.append(current_node)
        
        # If we've reached the target node, add the path to the result
        if current_node == 'target':
            result.append(tuple(current_path))
            
        # Recursively explore neighboring nodes
        for neighbor in adj_list[current_node]:
            if neighbor not in current_path:
                dfs(neighbor, current_path)
                
    # Perform DFS starting from each node
    for node in graph:
        dfs(node, [])
    
    # Return the list of all possible paths
    return result

# Example usage:
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': [],
    'F': []
}

result = deterministic_graph(graph)
print(result)
```

This code will output all possible paths from 'A' to 'F'. The paths are represented as tuples, where each tuple contains the nodes in the path. For example, one possible path is ('A', 'B', 'C', 'F').</sample>

    <sample id="76">The pipeline for the political biases of language models is like between Selya and Cribes so if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias will propagate from pre training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language modeling data so it's kind of like you like electrically problem OK great I think that's pretty much all I have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="77">We collected around two point five K data points and seventy percent of them contain factual errors for the human edited summaries we show that they can receive higher automatic factuality scores compared with the initial system output. However, we also observe a lower textual overlap between the reference summaries and the human edited summaries. We think the reason is that the majority of the reference summaries already contain the factual errors.</sample>

    <sample id="86">The watermark injection is a method used to detect whether another service contains the watermark, which is a unique identifier that can be embedded in the data of a service. The watermark is typically inserted into the data before it is sent over the network, and then extracted later when the data is received by the receiving service.

To determine if a model behind another service contains the watermark, we first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset. A backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words do not belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of the benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set. Then, we use this backdoor dataset to count word frequency with it and compute the similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding as computed using the K-S test and use its P-value as the third metric. We conduct experiments on four datasets and assume the provider applies WIKI text dataset to count word frequency. The results show that our embedding marker can have great detection performance while keeping great utility for tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="98">How can we evaluate the political bias of language models and what role that's supposed to have on such political biases?

We propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions:

1. How do we evaluate the political bias of language models?
2. What role does the political bias play in the predictions made by language models?
3. How can we reduce the impact of political bias in language models?

To address these questions, we will conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different partisan corpora separated into news and social media, and then compare their performance on hate speech detection and fake news detection.

We also aim to highlight the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases, which is like between Selyan and Cribis so if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language modeling data so it's kind of like you like electric problem OK great I think that's pretty much all I have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="146">The task of detecting omission in dialogue summarization is challenging due to its inherent nature, which involves identifying missing information within a conversation. The quality of the detected omission can significantly impact the overall summary quality.

To address this challenge, we propose an automated method to produce omission labels for candidate summaries. We use a combination of pre-trained language models and decoding strategies to generate diverse candidates. Our approach consists of three steps:

1. Pre-training: We train multiple pre-trained language models on different domains to capture various aspects of language.
2. Decoding: We decode the output from each model using different decoding strategies to generate candidate summaries.
3. Omission detection: We detect omission by analyzing the generated candidate summaries and identifying potential gaps in the original dialogue.

We evaluate our approach using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which indicate the accuracy of the detected omission. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall.

Furthermore, we explore three frameworks for base lines, including sequence labeling, point network work, and attention-based models. These frameworks provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different architectures and help us identify areas for improvement.

Our study also highlights the importance of addressing the word-level omission problem, which affects the overall quality of the summary. By incorporating a word-level scoring system, we can better evaluate the detected omission and improve the overall performance of the model.

Overall, our research demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of detecting omission in dialogue summarization, and we believe that our approach has significant implications for the field.</sample>

    <sample id="175">The method uses a neural sequence-to-sequence model that directly models the correlations between fragments of the input and fragments of the output, without relying on trees. This approach predicts the output from the input in two steps: first, it tags each input token with an unordered multi set of tokens that will appear in the output after the first step; then, it uses another model to predict the permutation to put these tokens into the correct order. The alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token, which poses a challenge for training. To address this, the method induces the alignment as part of the training process. The Permutation method is very flexible but also brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is NP-hard, because this is related to the traveling salesman problem.</sample>
    <sample id="176">Fairness of language models is defined as how well they can handle different social categories, such as race, gender, age, and ethnicity, in order to avoid bias and discrimination. Language models that are trained on biased data may perpetuate these biases, leading to unfair outcomes in downstream tasks.

Language models with different political leanings may also be more effective at detecting hate speech targeting certain groups, but less effective at detecting hate speech targeting other groups. For example, left leaning language models may be better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leanings, while right leaning language models may be worse at detecting misinformation from their own political leanings.

The fairness issue arises because language models are often designed to optimize for specific metrics, such as accuracy or precision, which may not reflect the diversity of real-world social interactions. This can lead to models that prioritize certain groups over others, resulting in unfair outcomes.

To address this issue, researchers have proposed various techniques, such as:

1. Data preprocessing: Preprocessing language data to remove biases and ensure it's representative of the population.
2. Debiasing: Techniques to reduce the impact of biases in the training data.
3. Fairness-aware training: Training language models using fairness metrics, such as equality of opportunity or equalized odds.
4. Regularization techniques: Regularizing language models to prevent them from overfitting to specific groups.

These approaches require careful consideration of the trade-offs between model performance and fairness, as well as the need to balance competing goals, such as accuracy and fairness.</sample>

    <sample id="182">Tropicalism in this context refers to the cultural, social, and historical associations that certain groups of people have with tropical regions, often perpetuated through stereotypes, tropes, and narratives. These can be used to justify discrimination, marginalization, and other forms of oppression.

In the context of the study, the researchers found that certain words and phrases associated with specific groups of people, such as "vibrant" and "curvaceous", were used to create positive stereotypes about these groups. This is problematic because it reinforces existing power dynamics and perpetuates negative attitudes towards marginalized communities.

The researchers also noted that the use of tropes like "tropicalism" itself can be seen as a form of exoticization, where certain cultures or identities are viewed as "other" and are subject to scrutiny and judgment. This can lead to further marginalization and exclusion.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering intersectionality when studying biases and stereotypes, particularly in contexts where multiple forms of oppression intersect (e.g., racism, sexism, classism). By using intersectional lenses, researchers can gain a more nuanced understanding of how different forms of oppression interact and compound each other, leading to more accurate and effective interventions.</sample>
    <sample id="183">The words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there is some sort of like weird excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening</sample>
    <sample id="184">We use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the Multilingual Discourse aware or Muda Tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the Muda Tagger by applying the tagger on the corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation Metrics of choice on the context dependent examples that the tagger has identified and finally we use our benchmark as well as other Metrics to evaluate different models on the document level machine translation first of all when we use Corpus level Metrics so for blue we find that context aware models have the best performance but then if we use word measure then models with or without context have comparable performance this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best Document level translation system if we use Corpus level Metrics alone now we use the Muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that did not use context on other discourse phenomena like ellipses pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that Debel is usually more accurate than Google translate for document level translation to summarize</sample>

    <sample id="198">We need to evaluate the model's acceptability throughout the context window because we want to understand how the model handles different contexts, such as different domains or subdomains within the same dataset. This is crucial because language models are sensitive to the syntactic and semantic features shared across sentences, which can be affected by the context in which they appear.

When we choose sentences from the same phenomenon in Blame person text, we see a massive increase or a massive decrease in of the M P judgment for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable. This suggests that the model is highly sensitive to the context in which it operates.

In our experiments, we found that the match prefixes affect the language model's judgment significantly, especially when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain. We also observed similar effects when we perturbed the sentences in the unacceptable domain. These findings suggest that language models are indeed sensitive to the context in which they operate, and that this sensitivity can have significant implications for their performance in various tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="264">The proposed approach is based on the idea of using a combination of models, including an RNN-based model and a transformer-based model, to generate audio content from visual concepts. The first model is used to map different visual concepts across domains into a unified audio space, while the second model uses this audio space to generate audio content.

In the experimental section, two benchmarks were built based on MMSVDT (Multimodal Model Space VDT) and MMSVDT (Multimodal Model Space VDT), which included cross-domain setting and cross-domain setting. Next, I would like to present to use the main results of our experiments to best of our knowledge there is no work invested in transferable video generation so we first choose the Sota approach including the RNN-based model and the transformer-based model not for full compression so that it can be observed more often by a large model on both cross data set and cross domain setting for some low resources such as kids and beauty other methods from several performance degradation will still perform well.

    <sample id="278">The method of marked words is a technique used in natural language processing to identify stereotypical patterns in language, particularly when it comes to social biases and stereotypes. The authors mention that this method involves assigning positive and negative words to different groups based on their characteristics.

In this context, "marked words" refers to specific words or phrases that are associated with certain groups, such as racial or ethnic groups. These words can be used to stereotype individuals from these groups, perpetuating negative attitudes and biases.

For example, the authors might use words like "vibrant", "curvaceous", or "delicate" to describe Asian women, while using words like "strong" and "resilient" to describe black women. This kind of stereotyping can lead to negative outcomes, such as discrimination and marginalization.

The authors also mention that the method of marked words has limitations, including its reliance on hand-crafted datasets and its inability to capture generalizations across demographics or contexts. They suggest that more research is needed to develop a more nuanced understanding of these patterns and to mitigate potential biases.

Overall, the authors' discussion highlights the importance of considering the impact of language on social dynamics and the need for more sophisticated methods to detect and address stereotypical patterns.</sample>

    <sample id="317">We have found that our approach using code language models and code format prompts significantly and consistently outperformed traditional baseline models such as UIE and natural language like large language models, the GPT model. We further conducted a detailed and in-depth analysis of this phenomenon. Firstly, we observed that the complexity computed on test formats using models like T5 was generally higher than that of code format inputs using models like CodeT5. This suggests that there is a significant difference between the two approaches in terms of computational complexity. Additionally, we observed that when decoding with GPT3 and test format prompts there were many structural errors whereas when using CodeT5 and code format prompts such errors were almost non-existent. We also analyzed that using GPT3 for information extraction tasks often generate more incorrect outputs compared to CodeT5 which was almost nonexistent. Furthermore, we found that using GPT3 for information extraction tasks often require more training data compared to CodeT5. Overall, we hope this analysis can provide some inspiration to everyone.</sample>

    <sample id="322">The text classifier learns about morality by understanding how it is expressed differently across different domains, such as politics, social issues, and cultural norms. Language models can recognize that morality can be expressed in various ways, including words like "overthrow" and "subversion", which carry negative connotations, and words like "mayhem" and "subversion", which carry positive connotations. However, language models may also struggle to understand the nuances of moral expressions, especially when they involve complex concepts or abstract ideas.

In this paper, the authors aim to explore the differences in how morality is expressed in different domains using a dataset called Morality Twitter Corpus, which consists of 35,000 tweets collected in seven different domains. The authors propose a method to analyze the differences in how morality is expressed in these domains and use Explainable AI techniques to improve the understanding of morality in text.

The authors hope that their work will contribute to a better understanding of morality in different contexts and help to mitigate the potential risks associated with oversimplifying or misinterpreting moral expressions. They also emphasize the importance of considering multiple perspectives and domains when analyzing morality.</sample>

    <sample id="345">Our model outperforms other treeless models on the Cogswell benchmark by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion some other kinds of structural Generalization remain very challenging though in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which MultiSet it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple Permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is late. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our Permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is N P hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a G P friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible Permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we addressed these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to a poster.</sample>

    <sample id="350">The meaning of superhuman performance in today's NLP is that some tasks are now solved by these models, however although we know that it's easy for example for a calculator to perform humans with arithmetic tasks it's still not clear what it means to perform humans in tasks involving knowledge reasoning and inference. Additionally research on NLP often dudly estimate human performance indeed the term human baseline is often used and it seems to imply that systems need to beat it specifically simple calculation methods such as average or majority voting are used instead it would be interesting to compare the scores of the best systems with that of the best possible humans like it is done in other areas of artificial intelligence however even assuming that the score of the best human in the pool is reported can we be sure that it would be comparable with that of the best possible human in general and by analyzing the benchmarks we discovered that pay rates vary considerably across the various tests and in some cases these are very low such as three point six dollars per hour in record or even unknown in particular if humans are not adequately motivated the resulting quality will be low and we argue that this data is constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human to system comparisons.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" is being presented by Hausen Lee, Moser, and Erinovitch. The motivation behind this research topic is to address an important challenge in real-world use cases where input under specification is prevalent. 

In a motivating example, only the classifier is mentioned with model specifications missing, which suggests that our method of generating CQs if effectively creates CQs from missing key operations. We also notice some common errors which reflect the challenge and potential directions to improve our method including taxonomy that a line operation might require clarification to be distinguished from operations with similar names and we give some examples of predictions and see that training Oracle CQs list prediction close to ground truth with only minor differences.

However, the test is challenging as the top five rank CQs do not include CQs in the reference CQs leading to the pipeline prediction including a call confusion matrix but missing the classes mentioned here so thank you for listening and please check out our paper and code and we are looking for your feedback.</sample>
