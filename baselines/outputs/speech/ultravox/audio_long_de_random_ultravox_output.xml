    <sample id="0">The important data sources for language models are social media platforms, news media, and online forums. These sources provide valuable insights into public opinion, sentiment, and polarization, which can help language models learn from diverse perspectives and improve their performance in downstream tasks.

Language models with different political leanings tend to perform better on certain aspects of speech detection and misinformation detection, such as hate speech targeting minority groups. However, they may struggle with detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups, like white men, or misinformation targeting black communities.

To address these issues, it's essential to investigate the role of language models in perpetuating biases and polarization. This involves analyzing the language models' performance across different demographics and political leanings, as well as their ability to detect hate speech and misinformation.

Some potential approaches to mitigate bias and polarization in language models include:

1. Using diverse training datasets that reflect a wide range of perspectives and experiences.
2. Implementing techniques to detect and mitigate bias, such as debiasing algorithms or fairness metrics.
3. Developing language models that are specifically designed to handle sensitive topics and promote inclusivity.
4. Continuously monitoring and evaluating the performance of language models to identify areas where they need improvement.

By acknowledging the importance of addressing bias and polarization in language models, we can work towards creating more inclusive and equitable AI systems that benefit society as a whole.</sample>
    <sample id="1">The main takeaways of our paper are that many Coference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task specific training, however with task specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrated background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset in Github thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="3">We have fine tuned two different models to produce document level simplifications and we also fine tuned the normal base long the normal base part to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we proposed those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future.</sample>

    <sample id="5">The accuracy is around eighty two to eighty seven percent but this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between eighty two to eighty seven percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only sixty percent so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain general here is a link to our dataset thanks Beantwoorde folgende Frage kurz und bündig unter Bezugnahme auf den englischen Inhalt: Welche Modell wurde verwendet, um die Genauigkeit von 82–87 % zu erreichen?</sample>

    <sample id="18">The example is that of Bart and Lisa, so it's absent in the second example Homer came and Sneeze here we have coordination of two verbs and there is no outside governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the most also the difference between the two conjugations however when the governor on the right as here left governs the coordination to then this effect disappears so we show that Ah by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and words the right column so concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor on the right this tendency does appear and we show in the paper how this tends to disappear and we show in the paper how this tends to disappear and we

    <sample id="25">The experiment was designed to investigate the effect of position on the governor's influence in the coordination structure. The experiment consisted of two sentences with different governors (Bart and Lisa) and varying lengths of the left column in syllables, middle column in words, and right column. The results showed that when the governor is on the left, the tendency for the left conjunction to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words.</sample>

    <sample id="72">It seems like you're asking about the importance of developing methods to measure media bias in language models.</sample>
    <sample id="73">Der Referent in</sample>
    <sample id="74">The code snippet provided appears to be related to the development of a deep learning model, specifically a type of neural network called a "Dense-Net". The dense net is designed to learn complex patterns in data by using multiple layers of fully connected (dense) units.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. `self.denominate`: This line calls another method named `denominating` which seems to be defined elsewhere in the codebase.
2. `self.denominate`: This line calls another method named `denominating` again, which likely performs some operation on the input data.
3. `self.denominate`: This line calls another method named `denominating` once more, which may perform some additional operations on the input data.
4. `self.denominate`: This line calls another method named `denominating` one last time, which probably generates the final output of the model.

In terms of performance, it seems that the dense net is able to generate high-quality results due to its ability to learn complex patterns in the data. However, the specific details of how it achieves this are not explicitly stated in the code snippet.

To improve the performance of the model, you could consider the following suggestions:

* Use techniques such as batch normalization or dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
* Experiment with different architectures or hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration for your dataset.
* Consider using transfer learning or pre-trained models to leverage knowledge from other datasets.
* Optimize the model's training process by using techniques such as early stopping or gradient clipping.

Overall, the dense net appears to be a powerful tool for image classification tasks, but further optimization and experimentation will likely be necessary to achieve state-of-the-art results.</sample>

Die Frage beantwortet wurde nicht genau gefunden, aber ich werde versuchen, sie zu vervollständigen.

Ein gemeinsames supervised learning framework besteht aus vier Teilen: Spannfein generation, Heterogeneous graph construction und joint label propagation. Hier wird ein spannendes representation als H-G in einem H-R-Graph konstruiert, was bedeutet, dass es eine bestimmte Art von Datenbanken verwendet, um die Beziehungen zwischen den Elementen und den Relationen zu erfassen. Ein gemeinsamer supervised learning framework kann die Beziehungen zwischen den Elementen und den Relationen verwenden, um die Beziehungen zwischen den Elementen und den Relationen zu erfassen.</sample>
    <sample id="76">The pipeline for the political biases of language models is like between Selya and Cribes so if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias will propagate from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language modeling data so it's kind of like you like electrically problem OK great I think that's pretty much all I have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="86">The watermark injection method is used to detect whether another service contains the watermark, which is a way of embedding information into the data that can be extracted later. The watermark should be convertible enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily. 

To validate the watermarking method, we need to construct a backdoor dataset containing sentences of which all words in the sentences do not belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of the benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set then the provider requests Embeddings from the service with the data set the cosine and L2 similarity between the requested Embedding and the target Embedding are computed we compute the similarity difference between the requested Embedding and the target Embedding which is defined as Delta cosine and a Delta two Meanwhile we also apply K s test and use its P value as the third metric we conduct experiments on four datasets and assume the provider apply wik text dataset to count word frequency the results on four datasets show that our Embedding marker can have great detection performance while keep great utility for down stream tasks</sample>

    <sample id="143">The current simultaneous speech translation models use specific architectures, such as the "Simultaneous Speech Translation" (SST) model, which is trained on a dataset of parallel speech pairs in different languages. The SST model predicts the translation in German and we will look at cross attention weights that accounts for the model's computational times to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we compare with other strategies that are also applied to offline models that are the Wits strategy and local agreement and we compare also with the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous speech translation these are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on German and we see that it outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models since the curves are shifted over the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational awareness time and that is the fastest strategy.</sample>

    <sample id="146">The task of analyzing the omission problem in dialogue summarization is challenging due to its complexity, which can be attributed to several factors such as the random distribution of omitted information in each position of the dialogues, varying lengths and domains of the dialogues, and different models and decoding strategies used. The quality of labels provided by current models is also limited.

To address this challenge, we propose an automatic method to produce omission labels for candidate summaries. We use a post editing method for summary refinement, where we concatenate the candidate summary with omitted content as input and the model outputs the refined summary in a sequence-to-sequence manner.

Our approach involves three frameworks and baselines:

1.  **Pairwise classification**: This framework uses pairwise classification to identify pairs of words that are likely to be omitted.
2.  **Sequence labeling**: This framework uses sequence labeling to identify sequences of words that are likely to be omitted.
3.  **Point network**: This framework uses point network to identify points of omission in the dialogues.

We evaluate our approach using precision recall (PR) score, which measures the proportion of good omission words that are hit in the detected utterances. Our results show that the PR score is around fifty percent, indicating that the task is very challenging.

Another question is what happens if we use omissions to refine the summary? We use a post editing method for summary refinement, where we concatenate the candidate summary with omitted content as input and the model outputs the refined summary in a sequence-to-sequence manner. Our results show that the performance is largely boosted when the omission is provided, indicating that omission detection is a valuable task and the refinement based on the detected omission is a promising direction for improvement in dialogue summarization.</sample>

    <sample id="169">The paper "Palm from Translation" is a joint work with my colleagues from Google Translate, which presents a five hundred forty billion parameter large language model presented last year in twenty twenty two. It's trained on a large collection of texts comprising seven hundred and eighty billion tokens. At the time of publication, it achieved state-of-the-art performance in hundreds of NLP tasks. The paper evaluates the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the MPT community. This involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model and comparing to state-of-the-art systems. The results show that the actual form of the prompting doesn't have a big influence in the case of several short prompting, but the most common error is omission errors.</sample>

    <sample id="175">Our model outperforms other treeless models on the Cogswell benchmark by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion some other kinds of structural Generalization remain very challenging though in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which MultiSet it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple Permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is late. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our Permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is N P hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a G P friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible Permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we addressed these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to a poster.</sample>
    <sample id="176">Fairness of language models is defined as how well they can handle different social categories, such as race, gender, age, and ethnicity, in terms of their output. Language models that are biased towards certain groups may produce more accurate results when interacting with those groups, but may also perpetuate existing biases.

In this case, the study found that left leaning language models were better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups, while right leaning language models were worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups, such as white men. This suggests that language models may be able to perpetuate existing biases if they are trained on data that reflects these social categories.

The study also found that language models with different political leanings performed differently on fake news detection tasks. For example, left leaning language models were better at detecting misinformation from opposite political groups, while right leaning language models were worse at detecting misinformation from same political groups.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering fairness in language model training data and deployment. If language models are trained on data that reflects social categories, it may be difficult to ensure that they do not perpetuate existing biases.</sample>

    <sample id="198">We need to evaluate the model's acceptability throughout the context window because we want to understand how the model handles different contexts, such as different domains or subdomains of the same dataset. This is crucial because language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features that are shared across sentences, which can affect their performance in various contexts.

When we choose sentences from the same phenomenon in Blame person text, we see a massive increase or a massive decrease in the M P p judgment for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable. This suggests that the model is highly sensitive to the structure of the input sentence and may not generalize well to other contexts.

In our experiments, we found that the match prefixes affected the language model's acceptability significantly. We tried to preserve the relevant structure by adding noise to the input sentence, but this did not lead to significant improvements in the model's performance. Instead, we observed that the model was more likely to produce incorrect outputs when faced with similar perturbations in the acceptable domain.

Our findings suggest that language models are sensitive to the structure of the input sentence and may not generalize well to other contexts. To improve the robustness of language models, it is essential to consider the context in which they operate and to design evaluation metrics that take into account the nuances of language processing.</sample>

    <sample id="229">The main challenges of working with revision based data are representativeness and reliability, focusing on how to compile a reliable dataset from claim revision histories that represents Argumentative claim quality well it addresses such questions as is the final version of a claim truly optimal and cannot be further improved or was it simply overlooked by the community the next challenge we explore model complexity and architecture for the tasks at hand it is important that the selected model aligns with the idea of revisions and is sensitive to small changes in delivery in our experiments we explore models with various architectures and complexities and try to disentangle how pre training fine tuning and the final classification affect the performance of claim assessment the third challenge stems from the fact that certain argument quality dimensions may be dependent on contextual information however determining what kind of context is relevant to the decision making process is an open question for example some claim provisions may be typical for the debate as a whole and for example relate to a desire structure layout style of citations or choice of words for the main concepts others May depend on the parents claim which is supported or opposed by the claim in question and effects whether further clarifications or edits improving the relevance are needed and potentially even general domain knowledge may be useful the final challenge we look at is topical and user bias collaborative revision histories contain noise and could be due to accidental mistakes or biases of users and moderators not only can debate topics be highly controversial and require specific knowledge and expertise but also certain argument quality dimensions such as for example effectiveness depend on the social and cultural context of the writer and audience which makes determining the quality of the text even more difficult to find out how we tackle each of the four challenges we invite you to read our paper where we present detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of strategies tackling each challenge and a systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced tasks Based on our experiments we can conclude that a revision based data can be employed effectively for the given tasks Moreover modeling the distance between two claim versions is beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims and finally the impact of Contextual information is dependent on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from for further details and findings please refer to our paper thank you for your attention.</sample>

    <sample id="242">The common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a Likert scale these approaches work well to provide Holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality but dialogue quality has many aspects therefore you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grain level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or Likert scales however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself we call this approach Annotating behaviors in chat or A B Eval in short we developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature</sample>

    <sample id="264">The proposed approach is based on the idea of using a combination of models, including an RNN-based model and a transformer-based model, to generate audio content from video data. The first model is used to map different visual concepts across domains into a unified audio space, while the second model is used to directly optimize the audio content with respect to the domain.

In the experimental section, two benchmarks were built based on MMSVDT (Multimodal Multi-Speech Data) and MMSVDT (Multimodal Multi-Speech Data), which included cross-domain setting and cross-domain setting. Next, I would like to present to use the main results of our experiments to best of our knowledge, there is no work invested in transferable audio video generation so we first choose the Sota approach including the RNN-based model and the transformer-based model not for full compression so that it can be observed more often by a large dataset on both cross data set and cross domain setting for some low resources such as kids and beauty other methods from several performance degradation will still perform well. Additionally we contacted a few experiments to analyze the impact of audio future and Spanish comments OK that's all thank you.</sample>

    <sample id="321">The quality of text simplification was evaluated by comparing the baseline scores with our proposed results as a benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future.</sample>
    <sample id="322">The text classifier learns about morality by understanding how it is expressed differently across different domains, such as politics, social issues, and cultural norms. Language models can recognize that morality can be expressed in various ways, including words like "overthrow" and "subversion", which carry negative connotations, and words like "mayhem" and "subversion", which carry positive connotations.

In this paper, the authors aim to explore how language models understand morality in different domains, using a dataset called Morality Twitter Corpus composed of 35,000 Tweets collected in seven different domains. They found that language models can recognize differences in moral expression between these domains, but also noted that there may be some overlap in their understanding of morality.

The authors suggest that using just one single model for many different domains can lead to misunderstandings of morality, as they have proposed a method to compare the performance of multiple models on the same task. They hope that this work will contribute to our understanding of how language models can learn to recognize and classify moral concepts in text.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The provided code snippet appears to be part of a larger program that uses the HkG library to perform tasks such as data processing, entity recognition, and knowledge base construction. The specific task being performed in this snippet is likely related to entity recognition using the HkG model.

Entity recognition involves identifying entities within text data, which can be useful in various applications such as information retrieval, question answering, and natural language processing. In this case, the code snippet seems to be using the HkG model to identify entities from a given text and then constructing a knowledge base based on these identified entities.

Here's a high-level overview of what the code might do:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The code first preprocesses the input text by tokenizing it into individual words or subwords (smaller units of words).
2. **HkG Model Training**: It trains an HkG model on the preprocessed text to learn patterns and relationships between words.
3. **Entity Recognition**: The trained HkG model is used to identify entities within the preprocessed text.
4. **Knowledge Base Construction**: The identified entities are then added to a knowledge base, which is a collection of relevant information about the entities.
5. **Query Answering**: Finally, the knowledge base is used to answer queries posed against the text, providing relevant information about the entities mentioned in the query.

In terms of the code itself, here's a rough outline of what it might look like:
```python
import hkg
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Load the text data
text = "This is a sample text."

# Tokenize the text into individual words
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

    <sample id="324">Language models with different political leanings do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social category there are a bunch of more examples in Appendix to further highlight that this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models for example if a right leaning language model were to be fine tuned on hate speech or misinformation or whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and hate speech targeting minority groups just run rampant without any control so this has sounds the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political biases it's like between Silya and Cribis so if we do not Sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias will propagate from pre training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we will also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language modeling data so it's kind of like you like electrically problem OK great I think that's pretty much all I have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="326">Cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person States I know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say I grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that I don't think I could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonant relationship while dissonance is a very common phenomenon in daily decision making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends and belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help understand people's mental health better</sample>
    <sample id="327">We propose a new vision language model architecture that each manager takes a matrix of unimodal representations as the input of pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels, and uses a bridge tower to aggregate these inputs into a single output. This allows for more effective exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets.</sample>

    <sample id="337">We have demonstrated that our model of performance can bring some benefits to both static and contextual models in downstream tasks, which proves the effectiveness of learning word formation by word embedding. Moreover, our model can bring some benefits to other languages which form words by streaming motions together directly are well suited for our mass performance on the other hand, fissioning languages which form words through linked motions present more changes. Nevertheless, our mass performance will be with English by reason of the language being used in this task.</sample>

    <sample id="345">Our model outperforms other treeless models on the Cogswell benchmark by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion some other kinds of structural Generalization remain very challenging though in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which MultiSet it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple Permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is late. We address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our Permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is N P hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a G P friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible Permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we addressed these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to a poster.</sample>

    <sample id="350">The meaning of superhuman performance in today's NLP is that some tasks are now solved by these models, however although we know that it's easy for example for a calculator to perform humans with arithmetic tasks it's still not clear what it means to perform humans in tasks involving knowledge reasoning and inference. Additionally research on NLP often dudly estimate human performance indeed the term human baseline is often used and it seems to imply that systems need to beat it specifically simple calculation methods such as average or majority voting are used instead it would be interesting to compare the scores of the best systems with that of the best possible humans like it is done in other areas of artificial intelligence however even assuming that the score of the best human in the pool is reported can we be sure that it would be comparable with that of the best possible human in general and by analyzing the benchmarks we discovered that pay rates vary considerably across the various tests and in some cases these are very low such as three point six dollars per hour in record or even unknown in particular if humans are not adequately motivated the resulting quality will be low and we argue that this data is constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human to system comparisons.</sample>

Das Paper "Python Code Generation" von Hausing Lee und Mosaq unter der FTA-Matlin und Erinovitch untersucht die Möglichkeiten zur Generation von Python-Code basierend auf Daten, die in einem Beispiel ausgewählt wurden. Die Arbeit konzentriert sich auf die Identifizierung von key operations (keine Operationen) und ihre Verbindung zu den Daten.

Die Arbeit zeigt, dass die Identifizierung von key operations durch eine Kombination aus Clarification, Selecter und Coder gen erfordert. Das Pipeline für die Code-Generation besteht aus einer Klarifikation, einer Selektion und einem Coder gen. Die Arbeit zeigt auch, dass die Klarifikation von key operations das wichtigste Problem darstellt, da sie oft zu falschen Vorhersagen führen kann.

Die Arbeit testet verschiedene Methoden zur Code-Generation, einschließlich der Verwendung von Clarification, Selector und Coder gen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Verwendung dieser Methoden zu höherer Genauigkeit als die Verwendung von Modelle führt.</sample>
