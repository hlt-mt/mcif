    <sample id="13">The sweet spot analysis is a method used in adaptive inference to reduce the inference time of large language models by using low-capacity models for easy samples and then training them separately on the entire training set, while running them sequentially until a classifier decides to halt the computation for early exit multiple classifiers are fit to the model following intermediate transformer layers they are all trained together and for inference a single sample is run through the model until a classifier decides to halt that way saving the computation which would have been exhausted by the rest of the model so let us look at this illustration on the left hand side you see the standard early exit model on the right hand side is our method we can see that each transformer layer only receives updates from its following classifier's loss function therefore avoiding the conflicting gradient problem completely</sample>

    <sample id="22">For good generalization, we would need a better model architecture, larger model size, as well as more fine-tuning examples. These go hand in hand, we can't just have one ingredient but throughout the others at the same time. The performance drop here is caused by temporal drift, kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though Conol two thousand and three has been used for over twenty years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do Conol two thousand and three tags still work well in twenty twenty three and we found that the answer is actually resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalizations of the models.</sample>

    <sample id="34">Crest is a joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual text generation, which combines selective rationalization with counterfactual generation. It uses a shared model to highlight meaningful rationals that are then passed to a predictor module that produces a decision.

The proposed approach leverages the pair structure of inputs to encourage the new model to focus on specific parts of the input that encode factual and counterfactual reasoning. This encourages the new model to be more focused on the contrastive parts of the input.

We have trained models using only factual examples in two setups, and performed data augmentation either using human counterfactors or counterfactors generated by Crest. We see that Crest performs well on par with these methods, and finally, for auto domain datasets it outperforms their methods.

Our results show that we can use Crest to improve downstream models, so now we ask are the rationals generated by Crest interpretable? We do this analysis in three dimensions in terms of lossability, forward Simulability and a new proposed metric called Counterfactual Simulability. This metric measures the ability of an explanation to change the classifier's decision when the classifier receives as input a contrastive added that was guided by this explanation. Overall, Crest provides more plausible rationals than other approaches and achieves higher counterfactual simulability than those produced by other methods.</sample>

    <sample id="41">The work of Peacock, personal commonsense knowledge for consistent and engaging narratives, collaborated with Sony group corporation, sustaining coherent and engaging narratives such as dialogues or stories requires natural language processing system to understand how the personalities of speakers, listeners or characters ground the narrative. For example, an adventurous architect may be interested in talking about outdoor explorations with his friends who have similar hobbies but he may prefer to discuss architectural design ideas instead with his colleagues at work. However, the network system has not yet learned good representations of real-world persons which involve rich world knowledge and complex interactions with each other.

In this study we propose a word level personal commonsense knowledge graph Peacock that contains large-scale high quality person's inference or knowledge resource can be used to train reliable personality generators and also enable more consistent and engaging narrative modeling. We use a knowledge linker to retrieve facts from Peacock that are relevant to each speaker's original personal profile and origins then we convert the retrieved facts into natural language statements to augment each speaker's profile. We choose the Peacock model as our baseline dialogue system human evaluation shows that Peacock augmented model achieve better dialog generation on various aspects including fluency consistency engagement and personal expression compared to the augmentation with atomic two thousand and twenty knowledge graph we also find that Peacock's personal centric commonsense knowledge is a more positive impact compared to general social commonsense knowledge.</sample>

    <sample id="67">The interference in multilingual translation models can be caused by various factors, including language similarity, data size, and tuning parameters. In this work, we investigated the effect of these factors on the level of interference in multilingual translation.

We used four variants of the transformer architecture, two middle ones are similar to the base and big configurations from the original paper, and we varied the total number of examples of interfering languages. We found that severe interference occurs only for the smallest models, and that the problem actually goes away with increasing model scale when using one-quarter of the Spanish data.

To control the trade-offs between performance and interference, we employed temperature sampling. When T is greater than 1, we sample more training examples from lower resource languages. The most common value used was 5, often without calibration. We trained multilingual models on all languages across sizes and temperatures, and these results showed that the X-axis is the average interference for the low-resource language pairs and Y is for the high-resource ones.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that a baseline for battling interference is weak to size in small models and too calibrated temperature for larger ones that use values that are too high.</sample>

    <sample id="109">The introduction of natural instructions, which is a dataset of natural language instructions and their corresponding outputs, has been shown to improve the performance of language models on various tasks such as text classification, question answering, and sentiment analysis. This approach involves collecting a large dataset of natural language instructions that cover a wide range of tasks and domains.

In this study, we collected a dataset of natural language instructions in a completely automatic process requiring only a small seed of manually constructed examples. We asked the model to generate an instruction and its corresponding output, and then we took the generated instruction and input and asked the model to generate another output. We also fine-tuned an eleven billion parameter T5 model on this dataset to measure its utility.

We found that the model can outperform both zero-shot and task-specific training on several benchmarks. Additionally, when the cost of generating examples is amortized, training on natural instructions outperforms our baseline on all benchmarks. Our baseline is an eleven billion parameter T5 model identical to the one trained on natural instructions only.</sample>

    <sample id="118">The standard MML is combined with switch MML representations has more Switchpoint information compared to just standard MML layer two so it might be a good idea to add a residual connection from layer nine to layer twelve this is what we do and we see it increases the amount of switch point information in the final representation so in summary we propose a new MML objective which is tuned to handle code switching information we hypothesize and verify using Probi classifiers that our methods increase the amount of switch point information present in the intermediate layers and with this result in mind we motivate some architectural changes and add an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information content content.</sample>
    <sample id="119">Language models with different political leanings do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social category. There are a bunch of more examples in Appendix to further highlight that this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models for example if a right leaning language model were to be fine tuned on hate speech or misinformation or whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and hate speech targeting minority groups just ran rampant without any control so this has sounds the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political biases so a little bit of discussion we would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases it's like between Selya and Cribes so if we do not Sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias will propagate from pre training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we will also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language modeling data so it's kind of like you like electrically problem OK great I think that's pretty much all I have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="123">We used a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens, and a coordinate of a bounding box. We followed the method from OFA and formulated all the tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format in which the input text, images, instruction, and bounding boxes were represented in the same token space. This allows us to unify the processing of various input and output data types.

We conducted experiments on multi-model classification tasks and reported accuracy if it's a multi-model generation task we report the sensitivity so this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variation in the training data. 

We also introduced additional evaluation metric called sensitivity so this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variation in the training data. 

Our results show that instruction tuning can significantly improve the performance on multi-model tasks as well as transfer learning from natural instruction datasets. By using more instructions, the model achieve better performance and lower sensitivity at the same time.</sample>

The second component is time sensitive reinforcement learning where we reward the model for correct predictions and give special penalty to temporally wrong predictions as shown in the example, the correct answer here is Fc Barcelona highlighted in green and temporally wrong answers are highlighted in yellow would denote our final model as time T five. We show the experiment results on TempT5, L1, L2 based on fine tuned task data, L5 SfT and TempT5 we can see that the performance of TempT5 significantly drops on L1 month prediction Besides its performance on L2 and L3 reasoning is also not promising even losing to the significantly smaller TempT5 in L2 reasoning for the two models that are fine tuned on TempT5 the performance are significantly better than the zero shot performance of instruction tuned L5 SfT last but not least our proposed TempT5 can improve the performance of TempT5 significantly in O B Q a and reason Q a if you take a closer look at L2 reasoning by time period we found that TempT5's performance varies greatly across different time periods shown that TempT5 has best performance we also observe some performance fluctuation over different time periods which could be related to the training data balance future work can work on overcoming such reasoning biases in conclusion we analyze and expose the temporal reasoning biases of L5 we also propose the TempT5 benchmark dataset that covers all three temporal reasoning types and comprehensive time periods last but at least we propose a training paradigm to improve our temporal reasoning capabilities that will be all of our presentation thank you all for your time.</sample>

    <sample id="127">Our method is simple. We apply the zero shot chain of thought prompting basically asking the teacher model to solve the question step by step if the final prediction is correct then we reformate the reasoning solution into a training sample for the student essentially the student is fine tuned to respond to the answers with a response to the questions with a step by step solution followed by the final answer now you may have seen this similar idea in recent works we were actually beaten by a similar paper from Google but just a few days on Archive so this is a summary of our results now if you're not satisfied with the performance on some of the harder tasks we show that there are many ways to scale student performance even further it's just quickly glance over the figures here so for the first one we see that

显性群体通常与社会和文化背景有关，因此它们可以帮助我们理解这些群体的行为、价值观和信仰。然而，这些群体也可能受到各种形式的歧视和偏见。

在本研究中，我们使用了一个名为“显性群体”的方法来识别这些群体的特征。在这种方法中，我们将给定的词组标记为“显性群体”，并且通过分析这些词组的分布来确定这些群体的特征。

显性群体的特征包括：

* 被描述为“强壮”
* 被描述为“美丽”
* 被描述为“年轻”
* 被描述为“富有”

这些特征可以帮助我们了解这些群体的行为、价值观和信仰，并且可以用来开发更有效的政策和措施来改善他们的生活质量。

但是，这个方法也有其局限性，因为它可能会导致一些负面结果，如歧视和偏见。因此，我们需要考虑如何使用显性群体的方法以更好地解决这些问题。</sample>

    <sample id="146">The problem of omission in dialogue summarization is a challenging task that has been studied extensively in recent years, particularly using large-scale pre-trained language models. These models can generate fluent and coherent summaries, but they often struggle with detecting missing information in the dialogues.

Omission refers to the missing content in the generated summaries, which is presented in the gold reference in this task. The model needs to predict which utterances of the dialogue are omitted in the candidate summary, and then use these predictions to refine the summary.

To address this challenge, we proposed three frameworks for baseline models:

1. **Pairwise classification**: This approach involves training a classifier on pairs of utterances from the same conversation, where one utterance is the original and the other is the predicted summary.
2. **Sequence labeling**: This approach involves training a sequence labeler on sequences of utterances from the same conversation, where each sequence is labeled as either "original" or "predicted".
3. **Point network**: This approach involves training a point network on points representing the similarity between utterances from the same conversation.

We used the precision recall score (PR) to evaluate the performance of our models. PR measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive examples (i.e., utterances that are both original and predicted) out of all true positives (i.e., correct predictions).

Our results show that even state-of-the-art models still achieve high omission rates, around 50%. This indicates that the task is very challenging, which requires more advanced detection models.

Another question is what happens if we use omissions to refine the summary? We propose an automatic method to produce omissions labels for candidates summaries, ensuring the quality of labels. Our method uses a post-editing approach, concatenating the candidate summary with omissions content as input and outputting the refined summary in a sequence-to-sequence manner.

From the figure, we find that the performance is largely boosted when omissions are provided, indicating that omissions detection is a valuable task. Refining based on detected omissions is a promising direction for improvement in dialogue summarization.

Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of addressing the omission problem in dialogue summarization and provides insights into how to improve the detection of missing information in dialogues.</sample>

    <sample id="158">The task of reference resolution in long documents involves identifying entities that have multiple mentions across the text, such as names, locations, organizations, etc. The goal is to link these entities with their corresponding references.

In this case, we proposed a dual cache approach that combines local and global caches to store local entities with a "Eviction policy" and global entities with an "Eviction policy". This allows us to reduce the complexity of the model by storing only the most frequently used entities locally and globally.

We evaluated four public benchmarks on DUCI (Document Understanding Constrained Information Retrieval) datasets, which contain training data and do not use unbounded memory. Our results show that DUCI performs better than baseline models even when using unbounded memory. However, without training data, our model with unbounded memory performs slightly better but still outperforms baseline models.

To evaluate the capability of DUCI, we analyzed a book with approximately 30,000 words. We found that the performance gap between DUCI and baseline models is much larger for book-level documents compared to other types of documents. Additionally, we showed that DUCI significantly reduces the catch miss compared to single cache models.

However, there are always trade-offs between model efficiency and performance for Caches-based models. In conclusion, DUCI uses a local and global cache to separately store local and global entities, which enables it to perform well on long documents while reducing the catch miss. Overall, DUCI is the most cost-effective option among the three approaches considered, making it a viable solution for large-scale document understanding tasks.</sample>

    <sample id="164">在弱监督学习中，强监督学习（Weak Supervision）是指在没有明确标签的情况下，通过其他方法获得样本的信息。这种方法可以提高模型的准确性和可靠性。

在弱监督学习中，有几个好处：

1. **减少数据量**: 在弱监督学习中，不需要大量的标签数据，因此可以节省数据资源。
2. **提高模型的可靠性**: 因为不需要明确标签数据，模型更容易识别错误或不正确的样本。
3. **提高模型的 generalizeability**: 在弱监督学习中，模型可以更好地generalize到未知样本上，因为它对样本进行了更多的预测。
4. **降低计算成本**: 在弱监督学习中，不需要训练模型的计算量较少，因此可以节省计算资源。
5. **提高模型的灵活性**: 在弱监督学习中，模型可以更容易适应新样本和新数据。

然而，在弱监督学习中，也有缺点，如：

1. **数据质量的影响**: 如果样本不够清晰或不够高质量，则模型可能难以识别错误或不正确的样本。
2. **模型的精度**: 如果模型不能够精确地识别错误或不正确的样本，则可能会导致模型的精度降低。

总之，弱监督学习是一个有效的方法，可以提高模型的准确性、可靠性和 generalizeability，而不需要大量的标签数据。</sample>
    <sample id="165">The paper "Adaptive Common-Sense Reasoning" by Wenzeng Jao presents an approach to adaptive reasoning that exploits mutually exclusive explanations. The authors define adaptive reasoning as starting with a context X, followed by an outcome Y, and then identifying possible explanations Z. They use a likelihood-based objective function to maximize the probability of outcomes given contexts and preferred explanations.

In their example, they consider two explanations: her flight was delayed (her flight left on time) and her flight left on time (her flight was delayed). The authors aim to enforce mutual exclusivity between these explanations, meaning that one cannot be true at the same time. To achieve this, they introduce an unsupervised learning method called Lipoor, which takes into account both entropy and log of M, where M is the number of possible explanations.

Lipoor maximizes the likelihood of outcomes given contexts and preferred explanations, while minimizing entropy of P of Z given x Y in case there are more than M explanations received probability mass. This approach outperforms other zero-shot models and previous best and supervised approaches, achieving over four absolute points in accuracy.</sample>

It's trained on a large collection of texts comprising seven hundred and eighty billion tokens. At the time of publication, it achieved state-of-the-art performance in hundreds of NLP tasks. The authors evaluated the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the MPT community, which involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model. They compared two state-of-the-art systems, the best performing systems of the MPT evaluation, and found that the most common error is omission errors. The style of the model is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy.</sample>

    <sample id="171">There is no specific research on embedding markers in this context, but there have been studies on using word embeddings as a feature representation for natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and question answering.

One approach is to use word embeddings as a feature representation for these tasks, where each word in the vocabulary is represented by a vector in a high-dimensional space. This can be done using techniques such as word2vec or GloVe, which learn word vectors from large corpora of text data.

Another approach is to use word embeddings as a feature representation for more complex tasks such as machine translation, named entity recognition, and question answering. In these cases, word embeddings can capture semantic relationships between words and phrases, which can be useful for tasks that require understanding the meaning of text.

However, it's worth noting that embedding markers may not always provide significant benefits over other approaches, especially if the task at hand requires a lot of computational resources or memory. Therefore, it's essential to carefully evaluate the performance of an embedding marker system and choose the best approach based on the specific requirements of the task.

In terms of specific metrics, some common evaluation metrics used for word embeddings include:

* Coherence: measures how well the embedded words align with their original meanings.
* Similarity: measures how similar the embedded words are to each other.
* Diversity: measures how diverse the embedded words are across different sentences or texts.
* Accuracy: measures how accurately the model predicts the correct word or phrase.

These metrics can be used to compare the performance of different embedding marker systems and choose the one that provides the best results.</sample>

    <sample id="175">The method we used is called treeless model, which means that it doesn't use trees as intermediate representations of the input-output pairs. Instead, it directly models the correlations between fragments of the input and fragments of the output using a neural sequence-to-sequence model. This approach allows us to handle deeper recursion without relying on trees, and it also enables us to predict the output from the input in two steps: first, we tag each input token with an unordered multi set of tokens that will appear in the output after the first step; then, we use another model to predict the permutation to put these tokens into the correct order. We introduced a new method to predict permutations that does not put any hard constraints on the possible Permutations, which makes our approach quite flexible and expressive.</sample>

    <sample id="179">The paper discusses the theory of mind, a concept in artificial intelligence that refers to the ability of a machine to reason about other agents' mental states. The authors present an experiment using symbolic Tom to improve theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models.

They use a dataset called "D1" which is a collection of stories with multiple characters, each with their own beliefs and actions. They then ask the model to generate new stories based on these characters' beliefs and actions, and evaluate its performance by measuring how accurately it predicts the next story's events.

The results show that the model performs significantly better than supervised approaches on out-of-domain story understanding tasks. This suggests that the model has improved its ability to reason about other agents' mental states.

The authors also discuss the importance of linguistic diversity in improving the performance of large language models. They propose generating a new dataset called "Paraphrase Tomi" which has more linguistic diversity, and evaluate its performance compared to the original dataset.

Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of symbolic Tom in improving theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models, and highlights the importance of linguistic diversity in achieving this goal.</sample>

    <sample id="229">The paper discusses the challenges of detecting and improving argumentative claims in text revisions, particularly when working with revision-based data. The authors propose two new tasks: optimal claim detection and claim improvement suggestion. They also explore four challenges related to representativeness and reliability, model complexity and architecture, and determining quality of text.

The first challenge is representativeness and reliability, which involves compiling a reliable dataset from claim revision histories that represents the quality of the text. This can be done by addressing such questions as whether the final version of a claim is truly optimal and whether it has been further improved or overlooked by the community.

The second challenge is model complexity and architecture, which requires selecting a suitable model that aligns with the idea of revisions and is sensitive to small changes in delivery. This can be achieved through various architectures and complexities, including fine-tuning and classification.

The third challenge is the impact of contextual information on the performance of claim assessment. Determining what kind of context is relevant to the decision-making process is an open question, and this can depend on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from.

Finally, the fourth challenge is the dependence of determining quality of text on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from. For further details and findings, please refer to our paper.

Overall, the authors conclude that a revision-based approach can be employed effectively for the given tasks, taking into account the benefits of modeling the distance between two claim versions and the importance of considering contextual information. However, they also acknowledge the need for further research to address these challenges and improve the overall effectiveness of the approach.</sample>

    <sample id="238">The dataset used in this study is called "MeetingSummaries" which contains information about meetings, including meeting dates, times, speakers, and summaries of each meeting. The dataset includes over 3000 instances of meetings across seven cities, with each instance containing source segments, transcripts, and summaries generated by seven models. The goal of the study was to evaluate the performance of different summarization systems on this dataset.

The results show that GPT-3 achieves the highest overall score, indicating exceptional performance in terms of fluency and coherence. However, its results are less impressive in terms of informativeness and factuality. This finding suggests that the current method of automatic evaluation matrix should be developed to better align with human preference.

The primary contribution of this study is the creation of the "MeetingSummaries" dataset, which serves as a useful tool for researchers to design advanced summarizers. Additionally, the dataset provides interesting insights into the decision-making process of city council members at the end of this video.</sample>

    <sample id="252">The performance of event-based models in prior case retrieval tasks has been found to be significantly lower compared to the previous transformer models, which highlights the complexities and nuances of the legal domain and the need for tailored approaches. The current state-of-the-art method for the CoLi twenty one document retrieval task is an event-based approach trained on Indian legal text in case law and in legal court. This approach has shown promising results in terms of inference time and F1 score.

However, this approach may not be suitable for all cases, especially those with complex legal concepts or nuanced terminology. To address these challenges, we have experimented with event-based models in the atomic events model, where each word in an event is considered as a separate unit. We filter the original corpus so that it contains only the sentences which produce matching events with other documents.

Our results show that the event filtered documents model outperforms all other methods with a significant boost. This suggests that event-based models can be effective in retrieving relevant documents from large collections of legal texts. However, further experiments and results are needed to validate and compare the performance of different event-based models.

In terms of performance, our method using event filtered documents outperforms all other methods with a significant boost. This indicates that event-based models can provide better retrieval results than traditional methods. Nevertheless, more research is required to fully explore the potential of event-based models in prior case retrieval tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="253">The model is trained on a large dataset of social media posts, including clinical tools such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which consists of 21 items that aim to identify and measure the severity of typical symptoms of depression. The BDI includes items such as mood, pessimism, sense of failure, dissatisfaction, guilt, and others.

When given a sentence with masked words, the model generates more general words while the model tends to be biased towards words related to mental disorders. This means that the model may focus on words like "focus", "talk", "breath", "sleep", and "eat" which are associated with common problems that are often linked to mental disorders.

To visualize the most important sequences of the text, an interactive head view in the form of a graph is used. This allows us to select a depressed user with the highest score in the BDI questionnaire and compute the attention scores of the user's post. We can observe that the most prominent words are related to anxiety and medication topics that are highly relevant to depression.

The combined effect of double domain adaptation and masking is effective at capturing signs of mental disorders in social media interactions. Our approach also achieves better results than those achieved by a model trained with a large amount of data. We want to explore the application of different lexical resources as well as using clinical data to improve our model's performance.

We will use various lexical resources, such as WordNet and ConceptNet, to generate more general words and reduce bias towards specific domains. Additionally, we will incorporate clinical data from sources such as the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Mental Health to provide a more comprehensive understanding of mental health issues.

By combining these approaches, we hope to develop a more accurate and effective model for detecting signs of mental disorders in social media interactions.</sample>
    <sample id="254">We propose a document level distant relation extraction from a framework with uncertainty guided label denoising to improve the model's quality of Ds data for posting the performance of Docker model. This is the overview of our framework, which first trains a pre-Denoise model with both DS and human annotated data to generate pseudo labels, since the first pseudo label contains a lower uncertainty score than its class uncertainty threshold. Then we replace the original DS label with the pseudo label that contains a lower uncertainty score than its class uncertainty threshold. In order to take full advantage of the DS data for posting the performance of Docker model, we design the multi-phase training strategy to iteratively relabel the DS data which is shown in this algorithm. We compare our framework with several strong base lines on two public datasets as shown in this table, our framework outperforms the previous base lines on both two datasets in conclusion the main contribution of our work is summarized as those four points the first one is our framework With uncertainty guided label denoising which greatly improves the label quality of the data the second one is the instance level uncertainty estimation method for overlapping relations the third one is the reactive relabelling strategy with dynamic class uncertainty threshold for the long term problem the last one is the great performance improvement.</sample>

研究人员还发现，使用多个随机词语可以更好地考虑到域层标签的影响，这是因为这些词语可以提供更丰富的文本信息，从而帮助模型对域层标签做出更好的判断。

最后，研究人员建议使用更多随机词语来减少模型的偏差，并且使用更多随机词语来考虑到域层标签的影响。这可以通过使用多个随机词语来实现，这些词语可以提供更丰富的文本信息，从而帮助模型对域层标签做出更好的判断。

因此，研究人员的工作结果表明，使用多个随机词语可以有效地减少模型的偏差，并且可以考虑到域层标签的影响，从而提高模型的准确度和性能。</sample>

    <sample id="278">The marked words method is used to identify the words that distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones. This method involves assigning weights to each word in the lexicon based on its frequency of use within the marked group, as well as its frequency of use within the unmarked group. The weights are then used to calculate the similarity between the marked words and the unmarked words.

In this case, the marked words method was used to analyze the stereotypes and patterns reflected in the words used to describe women of color. For example, the words "vibrant" and "curvaceous" were found to be associated with Asian women, while the words "petite" and "delicate" were associated with Latina women. These findings suggest that these words reflect negative stereotypes about women of color, which can have harmful consequences for their health and well-being.

The marked words method also reveals that there are many common tropes that are reflected in these words, such as the idea of tropicalism (a stereotype of Asian women being exotic and seductive). This highlights the need for researchers to consider how language reflects and reinforces social norms and biases.

Finally, the marked words method provides an opportunity to explore intersectional lenses, which involve analyzing how different forms of oppression intersect and compound one another. In this case, the marked words reveal how women of color are often subject to multiple forms of oppression, including racism, sexism, and classism, which can lead to complex and nuanced experiences of marginalization.</sample>

    <sample id="285">根据提供的信息，FEC（Factorial Error Correction）是用于减少因子错误在数据处理中的一个方法。 FEC通过将数据分成多个部分并对每个部分进行计算来实现这一点。它可以帮助提高数据的可靠性和准确度。

在FEC中，数据被分为多个部分，每个部分的计算结果相互独立，以此来减少因子错误。然后，数据的计算结果合并得到最终结果。这一过程称为“融合”或“合并”。

FEC的主要优势在于，它可以有效地减少因子错误，这使得数据处理更加可靠和准确。然而，FEC也有一些缺点：

1. **增加计算量**: FEC需要更多的计算资源，因为它需要对每个部分进行计算。
2. **增加存储需求**: FEC需要更多的存储空间，因为它需要保存每个部分的计算结果。
3. **复杂性增加**: FEC的计算过程更复杂，因为它需要考虑到多个部分的计算结果和融合过程。

在FEC中，数据的计算步骤如下：

1. **分解数据**:数据被分成多个部分，每个部分的大小与数据的大小相同。
2. **计算每个部分**:每个部分的计算结果相互独立，以此来减少因子错误。
3. **合并计算结果**:数据的计算结果合并得到最终结果。

在FEC中，数据的计算步骤可以使用不同的算法，如加法、乘法等。这些算法可以帮助提高数据的可靠性和准确度。

在FEC中，数据的分类步骤如下：

1. **分类数据**:数据被分类为不同类型，以便于后续的处理。
2. **计算每个类别的数据**:每个类别的数据被计算以获得其具体值。
3. **合并计算结果**:数据的计算结果合并得到最终结果。

在FEC中，数据的分类步骤可以使用不同的分类算法，如归类算法、分类器等。这些算法可以帮助提高数据的可靠性和准确度。

综上所述，FEC是一种有效的方法来减少因子错误，在数据处理中具有重要意义。但是，它也有一些缺点，需要在适当的条件下使用。</sample>

Our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help WSL approaches achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need twenty samples per class to attain better performance but that's not the end of the story because if we either decide to access clean samples then training on them directly will even achieve better performance the right figure shows the performance difference between fine tuning approaches which are directly applied on the clean data and WSL approaches which use the clean data for validation only as we can see if we have ten samples per class direct fine tuning starts to beat WSL approaches finally the performance improvement claimed in previous WSL approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine tuning on the clean validation samples as we can see from the figures the Valina model initially underperform more complicated WSL methods like Cosine however if we allow to continue fine tuning on the clean samples then FTL performs equally well as other methods so in practice there is no reason to choose more complex WSL methods which require more computation time and disk space.</sample>

    <sample id="321">To evaluate the quality of text simplification, you can use various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROUGE score. These metrics provide different perspectives on how well the model has simplified the text.

Precision is the ratio of true positives (correctly simplified sentences) to the sum of true positives and false positives (incorrectly simplified sentences). Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (sentences that were not correctly simplified).

F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which gives a balanced view of both aspects.

ROUGE score measures the similarity between the original text and the simplified text using a set of predefined rules. It's commonly used in machine translation tasks.

By evaluating these metrics, you can get an idea of how well your model has simplified the text and identify areas for improvement.</sample>
    <sample id="322">The text classifier learns about morality by understanding how it is expressed differently across different domains, such as politics, social issues, and cultural norms. Language models can recognize that morality can be expressed in various ways, including words like "overthrow" and "subversion", which carry negative connotations, and words like "frothed upon" and "encouraged", which carry positive connotations.

In this paper, the authors aim to explore how language models understand morality in different domains using a dataset called Morality Twitter corpus composed of 35,000 Tweets collected in seven different domains, including #AllLivesMatter and #BlackLivesMatter. They found that language models can recognize that morality can be expressed differently in each domain, but also that there are differences in the way morality is expressed between these two domains.

The authors propose a method to analyze the differences in morality expression between these two domains, which involves analyzing the frequency of certain words and phrases used in each domain. They also suggest that language models should be trained on multiple datasets to capture the nuances of morality expression across different domains.

Overall, the paper aims to provide insights into how language models understand morality in different contexts and to identify potential biases or limitations in their ability to capture moral nuance.</sample>
    <sample id="323">The HkG is a graph-based model that represents knowledge as nodes and edges, where each node represents an entity and each edge represents a relationship between entities. The HkG is used in various applications such as question answering, natural language processing, and information retrieval.

In this problem, we need to find the most relevant entities based on their relationships with other entities. We can use the HkG to represent the relationships between entities and then use it to find the most relevant entities.

We start by creating a graph of entities and their relationships using the HkG. Then, we update the entities and their relationships based on new data. Finally, we get the graph of entities and their relationships again after updating the data.

To get the most relevant entities, we can use the HkG to represent the relationships between entities and then use it to find the most relevant entities. This involves finding the entities that have the most direct relationships with other entities and then selecting those entities as the most relevant ones.

Here's how we can do it:

1. Create a graph of entities and their relationships using the HkG.
2. Update the entities and their relationships based on new data.
3. Get the graph of entities and their relationships again after updating the data.
4. Represent the relationships between entities using the HkG.
5. Find the entities that have the most direct relationships with other entities.
6. Select those entities as the most relevant ones.

By following these steps, we can find the most relevant entities based on their relationships with other entities.</sample>

    <sample id="330">在主动学习时，累积训练（Cumulative training）和迭代训练（Iterative training）都有其优缺点。累积训练通过将多个任务转换为不同的任务来提高效率，而迭代训练则通过逐步地进行任务的改进来提高准确度。

在本题中，我们发现累积训练对识别特定类别的效果较好，但迭代训练对识别特定类别的效果较差。因此，在主动学习时，累积训练可能是更有效的选择。

但是，在某些情况下，迭代训练也可以提供更好的结果，因为它可以根据每个任务的特征进行改进，从而提高准确度。所以，在主动学习时，需要根据具体情况选择最合适的方法。</sample>

    <sample id="333">The proposed framework is designed to improve the performance of the model by smoothing the representation space according to the knowledge learned from data. The training loop consists of two steps: first, the knowledge is extracted from the data store to guide the adapter to adjust the representation distribution; then, updated representations are used to refine the data store asynchronously. This approach has been tested on full benchmark datasets and found that even for the WMT winner model, its representation space can still be greatly improved. In our experiments, we explored three research questions: Can we smooth the representation space with small adaptors and drop the data store aside during inference? The second research question is how much improvement can be brought by using knowledge to adjust the representation distribution. The third research question is will together using an adapter and data store provide improvements as shown in the table ink system outperforms the state of the art KMT system and achieves better translation performance after smoothing the representation space compared with using an adapter baseline. We also found that refining the representation according to knowledge brings larger performance improvements to better show the effect of ink framework.</sample>

    <sample id="336">Cross-language transfer refers to the process of translating text from one language into another, often using machine translation models such as Google Translate API, Monolingual model, or multilingual model. It involves training a model on a source language (e.g., English) and then using it to translate text into another target language (e.g., German). The goal is to achieve high accuracy in both translations while minimizing errors and ensuring consistency across languages.</sample>
    <sample id="337">The model can handle various word formations, which is beneficial in English by reason of the composition of words. However, our model may struggle with languages that form words through linked phrases, as these languages present more changes than our model can handle. Nevertheless, our model can mimic the background embedding model so that we apply contrastive learning in the loss function to select positive samples from the graph such as the two words or the old word itself and pair the embedded graph level embedding with the layer background embedding to encourage proximity between them while pushing them further apart from other samples in a batch through extensive experiments we have demonstrated that our model of performance on both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks which proves the effectiveness of learning of words by word formation.</sample>

    <sample id="350">The meaning of superhuman performance in today's NLP is that some tasks are now solved by these models, however although we know that it's easy for example for a calculator to perform humans with arithmetic tasks it's still not clear what it means to perform humans in tasks involving knowledge reasoning and inference. Additionally research on NLP often dudly estimate human performance indeed the term human baseline is often used and it seems to imply that systems need to beat it specifically simple calculation methods such as average or majority voting are used instead it would be interesting to compare the scores of the best systems with that of the best possible humans like it is done in other areas of artificial intelligence however even assuming that the score of the best human in the pool is reported can we be sure that it would be comparable with that of the best possible human in general and by analyzing the benchmarks we discovered that pay rates vary considerably across the various tests and in some cases these are very low such as three point six dollars per hour in record or even unknown in particular if humans are not adequately motivated the resulting quality will be low and we argue that this data is constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human to system comparisons.</sample>
    <sample id="351">The performance of models in generalization tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER), has been observed over the years with some problems. One major issue is adaptive overfitting, which occurs when models are trained on the same dataset repeatedly without sufficient data variation. This leads to poor generalization performance.

Another problem is temporal drift, where the model's performance degrades due to an increasing temporal gap between the training and test data. In this case, we found that the model's performance drops significantly with larger temporal gaps.

To improve generalization, it is essential to combine multiple ingredients. A better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine-tuning examples can all contribute to better generalization performance.

However, our experiments showed that only one ingredient, namely, the model architecture, contributes to better generalization performance. The second ingredient, model size, also plays a role, but only up to a certain point. Finally, more fine-tuning examples do not necessarily lead to better generalization performance.

Our conclusion is that for good generalization, a better model architecture, larger model size, and more fine-tuning examples are necessary. These go hand-in-hand, and we cannot just have one ingredient alone. Our findings suggest that the performance drop here is caused by both adaptive overfitting and temporal drift, and they are not caused by adaptive overfitting even though Connole two thousand and three has been used for over twenty years.</sample>

    <sample id="353">The paper "Python Code Generation by Asking Clarification Questions" proposes a method to generate code by asking clarification questions, which can help alleviate the problem of under specification in real-world use cases. The authors also propose a pipeline of code generation that includes a prediction, a question selector, and a generator.

The proposed pipeline is designed to handle various types of queries, including yes or no questions and argument values as well as using documentations of operations instead of using argument values. The authors have two hypotheses: one is more challenging than existing Squeak ranking tasks, and another is supported by Squeak ranking results.

To test the pipeline, the authors see that it performs better than model-only training on CQs being answered and included increases, but has an opposite trend on unanswered clarifications. They then analyze the first thing is do the clarified key operations the reason for better generated codes and similarly yes we also give some example of predictions and see that training Oracle CQs list prediction close to ground truth with only minor differences.

However, the test is challenging because the top five ranked CQs do not include CQs in the reference CQs leading to the pipeline prediction including a confusion matrix and missing the classes mentioned here so thank you for listening and please check out our paper and code and we are looking for your feedback.</sample>
