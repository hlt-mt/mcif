    <sample id="0">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="1">hello everyone i'm makshatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmus task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university mila and microsoft research natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="2">hello everyone i am jiwoo from edgroup and here i'm going to be presenting our team's paper on document understanding the co-authors of this paper are all algorithm engineers from edgroup and this article is derived from our working practice in this paper we focus on the visually rich document understanding problem it aims to understand various types of documents like forms receipts and posters in recent years pre-training techniques have been introduced into this area and the self-supervised pre-training models have demonstrated great success in various related tasks however existing document pre-training models suffer from reading order issues following the idea of word decomposition we propose to use the link signaling token orders as the reading order in our model and aim to enhance the text-layout interactions and the layout representation is learned during pre-training it differs from previous studies in three aspects choice of word decomposition masking strategy and pre-training objectives instead of word decomposition masking the first and last words of each segment has a higher probability to be masked so the model has to find the context for each word based on the semantic relations and the information from the two deprepositions during pre-training for more details of the paper please refer to our paper and posters thanks for watching if you have any question please send me emails</sample>
    <sample id="3">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level deplain is a parallel pair of text for example of documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence different techniques are possible as you can see in the example such as lexical substitution clause deletion cross deletion reordering or insertion of words we now propose our new corpus deplain because in the recent years there were some problems with existing corpora so for example these corpora here are too small to train a text simplification model on and the other hand in the web corpus we have much more rephrasings so let's now see what we can do with this corpus hello i'm omar and now i will talk about the use cases for our dataset deplain so for the first use case we can evaluate automatic alignment methods in the recent years there has been a lot of alignment methods but in the context of machine translations where we have two parallel documents written in different language and we want to extract alignments of sentences in post documents but in our use case we are trying to extract alignments between sentences of two parallel documents having the same language having the same content but they are on a different complexity level and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="4">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when translations require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence and in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x and we call our tagger the multi-lingual discourse aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="5">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parretti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="7">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll-2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll-2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll-2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="8">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="12">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning approaches are proposed to robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize well beyond the original weak labels so in practice there is no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="13">hello everybody my name is daniel rotem and i will be presenting my work finding the sweet spot analysis and improvement of adaptive inference in low resource settings which was done in professor roy schwartz's lab at the hebrew university in jerusalem adaptive inference is a method for reducing the inference time of large language models to use it we rely on the fact that real world data varies in complexity therefore we can use low capacity models for easy samples and therefore in that way reduce the average inference cost whether it be time or money the two most common adaptive inference methods are multimodel and early exit in multimodel multiple models are stored together each fit with a classifier at the end they are trained separately on the entire training set and for inference we run a sample through the model until a classifier decides to halt that way saving the computation which would have been exhausted by the rest of the model in order to test our hypothesis we compared individual early exit models classifiers with separate multimodel classifiers which are truncated versions of the bert pre-trained language models the takeaways from our work are as follows we show the existence of conflicting gradients in early exit training process to the best of our knowledge we conduct the first fair comparison of early exit and multimodel adaptive inference methods we also introduce the sweet method the results of which motivate future research of fine tuning algorithms tailored to the early exit architecture thank you very much for listening if you enjoyed the talk and you want to see more go visit our paper on archive finding the sweet spot</sample>
    <sample id="14">hi my name is adam sperkoski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination to the right this effect disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="15">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps first we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output after the first step we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered that's why in our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging though in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="17">hi everyone my name is jingchuan wu a phd student in ais i'm glad to introduce our work about multimodal relation extraction relation extraction is a widely explored task it aims to determine the semantic relation between entities in a given text however in some realistic scenarios such as in social media the data is often in various forms and modalities rather than just pure text so if you just look at the text you may find that lacks sufficient context to understand some ambiguous or multisensory words to address this issue multimodal relation extraction has been introduced recently additional visual sources are added to the text-based relation extraction and then we consider taking multimodal topic information as additional semantic supplementary to enrich the overall context to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method we conduct experiments on a widely used mmr dataset in the ablation study we find that the information screening and compensating both contribute to the task performances and the syngraph is beneficial for structural modeling of the multimodal inputs when removing the syngraph the performances get decreased next we want to know under what circumstance do the internal information screening and external information exploiting help so we group the instances by text-based relevance scores and make the predictions for different groups for the inputs with higher text-based relevance the syngraph contributes more significantly than gene that means the external information exploiting is more useful in conclusion we introduce a novel idea of simultaneous information subtraction and addition for multimodal relation extraction we perform internal information screening with the guidance of the graph information bot-like principle we devise a latent multimodal topic model and induce latent multimodal topic features to enrich the future context our overall system achieves significant improvements over the existing best models on the benchmark so thanks a lot if you are interested in our work you can scan the qr code for more detailed information thank you</sample>

    <sample id="22">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="23">hi i'm dan garrett and i'm going to talk about our work on improving the ability for text to image models to render visual text text to image modeling research has made huge strides in the last year with the ability to generate very high quality interesting images but a lot of people have noticed that these models are often very bad at representing text so we specifically look at the t5 xxl model and then using that encoded text representation as input to a diffusion model which is actually able to generate the image here we can see a fairly complex input producing an accurate image output however even a much simpler input that requires the image to contain a word will often fail to understand what's going on here we can dig into the text encoder itself t5 uses sentence piece tokenization which means that instead of the model receiving the individual letters that make up the spelling of the input it's receiving subword ids for chunks of the input string that means if it's asked to render a word it has to be able to decompose that atomic subword vocabulary item into the individual letters that make up the spelling and that's because the way the sentence piece algorithm works is that more frequent words tend to be represented by a single vocabulary item or a couple of subwords and so that means that the model is having to take a smaller number of bigger chunks and decompose it into a larger number of letters here again we can see that t5 because it has full access to the character level information does very well and isn't affected by the frequency of the word all it has to do is learn how to copy the input characters to the output and so you can see in this graph here that across all scales t5 does very well at spelling to improve the text rendering models and a new efficient strategy for improving model spelling ability which is to concatenate in a model that's actually aware of the characters in the input</sample>

    <sample id="30">hello everyone we are going to introduce our paper blender which is a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework for large language models and this key idea is based on pairwise ranking and generative fusion so there are so many large language models released every week and many of them claim that they have achieved a great performance um and from this blender we can it did say oh some models are better than the others but this is only about average overall performance and when you have a particular input example should you uh simply use a single top one model and our blender encodes a pair of candidates alongside the input x for better analyzing the subtle differences between these two candidates so this is very different from pairwise methods which um they uh look at each candidate individually and score the candidate individually and then rank all the candidates based on their scores so we believe um pairwise ranking is a better solution because it uses pairwise comparisons to learn and infer the quality of all these candidates and um particularly like blender's results can beat them in 68 percent and 76 percent of examples respectively for uh uh open assistant and uh makuna and these results suggest that blender is a very promising framework for ensemble learning although it's very simple and straightforward so uh in the end we want to give um uh some uh take home messages here so blender is a simple and effective ensemble learning framework for large language models it has two sub-modules pairwise ranking is a pairwise first module that we can uh get the matrix for all these results and jump user can take the top three candidates and generate the final output and it largely improved the performance and mix instruct is our data set

    <sample id="31">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller tanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="34">hello everyone my name is marcus treviso and today i'm going to present a work called crest a joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual text generation crest is the result of a great collaboration with alexis ross luno geheru and dr martins so let's say we have an input like this one we pass this input to our rationalizer model which has a trainable masker component that is trained to produce meaningful rationales and here is how it works let's say we start with crest generation which produces two outputs in the end one is basically the rational z for the original input x and the other is the counterfactual x tilde from here we get two computation flows a factual flow responsible for processing the original input and a counterfactual flow for the counterfactual input that produces by a large margin so to summarize we propose crest a joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual generation that produces valid fluent and diverse counterfactuals in a controllable way and that by leveraging these counterfactuals during training it leads to plausible explanations that focus on the contrasted parts of the input take a look at our paper and our code for more information thank you</sample>
    <sample id="36">hi welcome to acl i'm daniel suarez beach and this is a sneak peek into language specific layers for multilingual machine translation joint work with robin schmidt yi chu liao and stefan bitz multilingual machine translation has several advantages namely scalability as it's easier to train and maintain a single model rather than one model per language direction speed because you can directly translate between any two languages instead of having to pivot through a third language like english and this also leads to lesser cascade finally you get improvements for low resource language pairs on the other hand it also means a larger model size and this is what lets us keep the inference costs constant because at inference time only the language specific layers are shared the next two layers are source specific lsls then we have a few more shared layers then three target specific lsls and the top layer is shared in this case we're showing a target specific decoder model but in the paper we also show results for shared decoder models also our architectures are all based on the deep encoder shallow decoder model we report numbers for flores 101 and report charaf sp blue and comet and our architectures are all based on the deep encoder shallow decoder model thank you very much and enjoy acl bye bye</sample>
    <sample id="37">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in large language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes and stereotypical narratives in our work we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="38">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination is lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="39">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from read to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from read to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap uh these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen treebank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and uh also the observation that was made in passing that uh this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect grows with the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination then the net uh this effect disappears so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we showed in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="40">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance as two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with a uc of 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="41">hi this is suling coming from the natural language processing lab at apfr university now i'm going to introduce our work of peacock personal common sense knowledge graph peacock based on the studies of human interactive behaviors we frame the relations of persons and their attributes in three dimensions including four types of man relations as well as interactivity and distinctiveness detailed descriptions of these relations are listed here we build peacock in three steps first we select persons from existing common sense knowledge graphs which include both human roles and event-based entities then we induce attributes of persons from both common sense knowledge graphs and large-scale pre-trained language models finally we cross-sort the annotations of peacock relations via a joint human ai majority voting scheme human evaluation shows that peacock augmented model achieves better dialogue generation on various aspects including fluency consistency and engagement and personal expression by comparing to the augmentation with atomic 2020 knowledge graph we also find that peacock's personal-centric common sense knowledge yields a more positive impact compared to general social common sense knowledge in narratives in summary we propose a world-level personal common sense knowledge graph peacock that contains large-scale high-quality personal influences our knowledge resource can be used to train reliable personal knowledge generators and also enable more consistent and engaging narrative modeling our paper and github site for this work are public now which can also be found on our lab website</sample>
    <sample id="42">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="46">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context the sentence level or at the word level we can think of words that have high p x m i as words that require context for translation to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="47">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="49">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra karen flintus roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context like whether the context is coming from a different uh subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current uh like to the sentence that we are looking at so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding uh like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model uh like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="50">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification also overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="51">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia so the alt entity corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x large model are summarized below if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="53">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data as shown in this figure the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels meaning that the training is pointless this indicates that weak supervision approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weak supervision approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="54">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them prc here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="55">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of that we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot and also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="56">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the source language to the target language then use monolingual model to train and evaluate and we also test monolingual fusion setting by training monolingual models with only 10 of training data and we also test multilingual setting we found that encoder decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets and only gains in three datasets i think this is known as the curse of multilinguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found multilingual language models such as coders and blue are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multilingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and et cetera and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="59">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natschos a second version of 4 gigabytes of natschos a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english bert model trained on the 4 gigabytes of natschos show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on camanber weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here camanber we also observe that specialize data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natschos are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="61">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data then the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well this implies that weakly supervised learning approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weakly supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent weakly supervised learning approaches require clean manually annotated samples to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second weakly supervised learning approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="62">hello my name is nitin kaldellon and i'm the main author of this icl paper a systematic study of knowledge distillation for natural language generation this is a pseudotarget training and this is a fantastic collaboration with amir and the super four me at microsoft and my phd advisor ravi raghavan so as we all know natural language generation systems or energy systems are based on large language models and they become larger more complex and much more slow which can also come with great financial cost as a result there is a growing demand in the industry for compressing these models and the main problem is that while you want to compress your large model you also want to preserve its performance and this is exactly the goal of this paper we want to explore the potential of energy compression or in other words the finding the recipe for energy distillation and the first two stages explore the architectural decisions for example in the first stage we compare encoder decoder to decoder only architectures and for more details about the study the methods and the first exposure bias motivation we provide in knowledge distillation setups you can

    <sample id="63">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="64">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embedding and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="66">mathematical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence that enables us to comprehend and make decisions based on numerical data and language. the development of machines capable of mathematical reasoning has been a long-standing focus of artificial intelligence and machine learning. in recent years, there has been a surge of interest in this area. mathematical reasoning is not limited to text-based data; it can extend to multimodal information, such as images, figures, and tables. in the last few years, we have witnessed the remarkable development of pre-trained language models such as large language models (llms). these models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. despite the advantages, llms still face inherent limitations, such as the lack of the ability to perform precise mathematical reasoning. one effective solution to boost the performance of llms is to replace the greedy decoding strategy with self-consistency instead of generating just one reasoning path, a diverse set of reasoning paths are sampled from the language model's decoder and the most frequent one is chosen from the answer set. in addition to designing effective prompting methods for llms, a novel line of work is to design the true augmented llms for example, program-aided llms are very helpful in complex mathematical reasoning tasks. despite the creation of various datasets, mathematical reasoning in low-resource settings remains underexplored. recently, there has been attempts to build non-english datasets for chinese, korean, and arabic. pioneering research has developed mathematical reasoning benchmarks for financial, scientific, and medical domains. despite the impressive progress, deep learning models commonly display generalization and robustness failures on reasoning tasks first, large models struggle with large numbers second, large language models are inconsistent with mathematical reasoning with that thank you so much for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="67">hi i'm uri and today i want to talk to you about interference in multilingual translation models these models can benefit from synergy between different language pairs or suffer from interference for example training to translate english to finnish may improve the quality of english to estonian while english to finnish may not so we conclude that language similarity is not a dominant factor for interference we invite you to take a look at the paper for experiments on the effect of number of languages as well as results with more languages sharing similar trends now we experiment across model and focus data sizes when varying the total number of examples over interfering languages and these are the results the x-axis is the average interference for the low resource language pairs and y is for the high resource ones temperature values from 1 to 5 are on the markers based on this we can say that a baseline for battling interference is weak due to size in the small models and weak due to uncalibrated temperature for larger ones that use values that are too high the lesson here is that tune temperature is key for strong performance to conclude we find that model and data size affect the levels of interference in multilingual translation while other factors like language similarity affect much less and that modest scale and tune temperature can reduce the problem significantly without any other specialized method thank you</sample>
    <sample id="68">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="70">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first generate personas using prompts to generate

    <sample id="71">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="72">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="75">hi my name is jian dan today i'm very pleased to present our work joint prop this is a joint work with my friend hao an and my supervisor lou antoine first i'm going to talk about the motivation of our work name entity recognition and relation extraction are two crucial tasks in information extraction supervised learning scheme have made a significant progress in ner and relation tasks by leveraging rich labeled data however fully supervised model requires an extensive label to obtain high quality data annotation and it requires a diverse annotated data for various domains and applications semi-supervised learning aims to model the ner and relation tasks by propagating labels through the whole graph along with high density areas formed by the unlabeled data to retrain the classification model the retrained model remains the same as the baseline model as the joint ner and relation classification function finally the experiment part we conducted our experiment on four datasets there are joint task datasets and single task datasets there is no previous baseline on joint task so comparisons are only made with base model performance as we can see the experiment tables the joint learning of two tasks benefit from the codependency between the two tasks in joint datasets for single task datasets our framework shows significant and consistent improvement over all baselines both for ner and relation tasks thank you very much for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="76">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="77">this video is for sharing our work on improving standardization factual consistency from natural language feedback this is the joint work from yale university and microsoft research and most of the work was done when the first author was an intern at microsoft research in this work we introduce a new dataset de facto which contains human demonstrations and feedback for improving standardization factual consistency for this dataset we provide comprehensive analysis and we offer further insights into the factual consistency of the existing standardization models we asked the annotators to provide labels to decide whether the summary is factual consistent and we require them to provide human corrected factual consistent summaries if they think the original summary is not correct also we require them to provide human feedback which contains the instructions explanation and evidence in this slide we show the data distribution of the annotated editing instructions and their relation with the different error types the third task is to automatically correct factual errors while generating the corresponding explanation we found that the editing model can achieve comparable performance compared with the baseline models while trained on much fewer data and training the model to generate the explanation can help the model to achieve better performance apart from providing a testbed for the proposed nlg tasks over this that also has other advantages thanks to its fun-grained annotations which can be valuable for training factuality metrics and factuality model evaluation we have released our collected de facto dataset on github and please check our paper for more details thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="78">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="79">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple constraints we propose our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as co-script we can trace smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we find that co-script can generate scripts of high quality than most large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable datasets in summary a way established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use a large language models to generate a high quality dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="80">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as a service via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as a service currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as a service is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as a service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as a service therefore it is necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as a service to protect the copyright of embedding as a service one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as a service second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as a service third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's service during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as a service or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as a service the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="81">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets and only gains in three datasets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boosts the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="83">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the pennsylvania state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets and only gains in three datasets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boosts the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="86">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embedding and normal embedding that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="87">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of set of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which public and private down-stream tasks such as named entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to six baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 gigabytes common bert 4 gigabytes of common bert 4 gigabytes of schubert and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total from scratch training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks however our experiment on continuous pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of bert and trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on common bert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proposed system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that specialize data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="89">hi i'm sara papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo nigro and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where the attention points to and what is emitted if the attention is above a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in german and we also look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of that we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="90">hello i'm hannah lee one of the authors of rethinking annotation can language learners contribute as language models advance data annotation gets essential in nlp it has been customary to recruit native speakers for data annotation and word meaning questions asking about the meaning of the words to check their language proficiency and language learners' capabilities of nlp data annotation by showing training simulations with learners' annotations language models trained on learners' less accurate labels achieved about 95 of ground truth performance and sometimes outperformed the model trained with native speakers' labels in conclusion this paper questions the necessity of recruiting native speakers for data annotation and showed that language learners could definitely contribute to nlp annotations we believe this work showed the possibility of broadening nlp research for many languages jumping over geographic and technological barriers to building benchmark data sets for low-resource languages where it is hard to recruit native speakers thank you for listening please refer to our paper for more details such as how control variables affect annotation performances any questions are welcome via the email below</sample>
    <sample id="91">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="92">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="94">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the watermark method contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="97">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and funded by the national research council and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about it and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to the last lambda speech frames that is lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of that we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="98">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political biases of language models on the two different temporal corpora we can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017 so this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models for example if a right-leaning language models were to be fine-tuned on unhate speech or misinformation and whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control so this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political biases it's like between syracuse and caribdis so if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="103">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emily wu andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence which makes corpus-level metrics like blue unable to capture these translations and some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model to answer the second question we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part-of-speech tags that have high pxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high pxmi and this can be explained because english does not have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="107">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the pennsylvania state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets and only gains in three datasets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for fused setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boosts the performance of fused on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="108">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show a like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see a similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="109">hi i'm or and i will present a natural instructions tuning language models with almost no human label in this talk we ask whether we can create a large dataset of instructions that is diverse in tasks content and phrasing without any human label so to collect instructions we prompt a pre-trained language model here specifically a variant of gpt-3 with three examples taken from the supernatural instructions dataset and we ask the model to generate a fourth example and you can see our data generation prompt here in the image so at the first step we prompt the model to generate an instruction and a corresponding input and at the second step we take the generated instruction and input and we ask the model to generate a corresponding output and we further diversify the dataset format by generating additional paraphrases of each instruction so again this is done in a completely automatic process requiring only a small set of manually constructed examples and natural instructions highlights the ability of language models to produce creative and diverse data this is difficult to obtain with crowd workers who usually collapse into predictable heuristics and form annotation artifacts at the same time language models are also faster and cheaper than human annotation to conclude we introduce a natural instructions which is a dataset of instructions for a wide variety of natural language tasks a natural instructions was collected in a completely automatic process requiring only a small set of manually constructed examples and natural instructions highlights the ability of language models to produce creative and diverse data this is difficult to obtain with crowd workers who usually collapse into predictable heuristics and form annotation artifacts at the same time language models are also faster and cheaper than human annotation thank you</sample>

    <sample id="112">hallo everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="114">hi everyone uh i'm going to introduce our work on acl 2023 called finding the pillars of strengths for multi-head attention so we are from nanyang technological university of singapore to begin with as we all know the large language models are game-changing from the task-specific models for each field of natural language processing now the large language models can learn all tasks in one model and this is revolutionary however several limitations are identified for example the heavy parameters they usually contain billions of parameters which is not deployable on small clusters they usually require long training time for example the lama 65 takes one million gpu hours with our even with our best gpus and they are talking hungry they require huge corpus for example the lama 65 is trained on four point four five terabyte corpus today we're going to focus on the heavy parameter problem of the multi-head attention so as we all know the multi-head attention is designed to attend to different subspaces of the input and each head attends to a unique but different input subspace but as we all know that we only remain one head for each group and achieved significant parameter compression in extreme conditions we can compress 90 of parameter 622 factor inference speed and 80 flop against the model which yields the same performance on the same dataset in the future we identify that the task-specific automatic pruning is very promising direction so given the lottery ticket hypothesis uh we know that the networks contain sub-networks that reach task accuracy comparable to the to the original network which means that we believe that we can prune the networks without sacrificing the performance as we as we uninstall the apps on our iphone and if imagine that if we don't uninstall the unused apps on our iphone they will be too heavy to use so this is all for today's video if you want to know more about our work please do not hesitate to attend to our poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="115">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and funded by the national research council and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where the attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is the alpha is below a certain threshold alpha and that is lambda speech frames that is lambda speech frames this means that these lambda speech frames will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted over the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="116">hello everyone i'm makshatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmus task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university mila and microsoft research natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="118">hello everyone we'll be presenting our acl 2023 submission which is the improving pre-training techniques for code-switched nlp so first we define what code-switching is so here we have an example laptop mira bag mira kai this is a code-mixed sentence of english and hindi so some of the words are english and some of the words are hindi so this is a pretty common occurrence in linguistically diverse communities like india so building computational models for code-switching is very important for this case multilingual pre-trained models like mbert and xlm-r don't perform that well on code-switching tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis so our main contributions in this work are we propose novel mlm techniques which are tuned to the case of code-switching and we motivate architectural changes and add an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information in the final representation so in summary we propose a new mlm objective which is tuned to handle code-switched information we hypothesize and verify using probing classifiers that our methods increase the amount of switch point information present in the intermediate layers and with this result in mind we motivate some architectural changes and add an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information content thank you</sample>
    <sample id="119">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="121">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="122">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constraint language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constraint language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with specific constraints a good planner should generate scripts that are reasonable and faithful to the constraints in this paper we adopt the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning data sets from large language models we apply our method for building a data set of constrained language planning named co-script for constraint language planning we find that co-script data sets can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="123">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning data set with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="124">hi everyone this is tan jie yi from the national university of singapore and ali baba i'm glad to share our work towards benchmarking and improving the temporal reasoning capability of lms time is a fundamental axis in the real world we first break down temporal reasoning into three different levels the first level is time to time reasoning such as what is the year after 2010 answering this question will only meet the understanding of the time axis the second level is time to event reasoning in this work we include long duration facts as event as well an example question is what team did leo messi play for in 2020 this question not only requires understanding of time but also needs the grounding of event to time for example in this question all teams of leo messi played for in their corresponding time periods will be provided to lms and they need to find the correct answer based on the given information in order to improve the temporal reasoning

    <sample id="126">hello everyone my name is xin jian from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoders and decoders and we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="127">hi thanks for tuning in i'm namguho a master's student at keist ai in korea i'd like to introduce our work large language models as reasoning teachers to transfer their reasoning abilities to much smaller models we propose a novel technique called diverse reasoning if you see here we don't only generate one reasoning sample from the teacher we generate many of them using stochastic temperature sampling and since these are very complex questions all of these solutions have slightly distinct solutions and that is why these samples can be used to train the student even better and we found that students under fine-tuned this method that we call fine-tuned cot can perform a complex reasoning task quite well now there's a lot of analysis and discussion that is in the paper but we don't have time for that so you can check the paper for more details so the basic takeaways is that simple distillation can transfer the reasoning abilities from very large teachers to small students smaller than 1 billion parameters and this may be possible for other emergent abilities in the future our method with diverse reasoning is accessible and it's a very effective approach and it's also very highly scalable and this kind of distillation poses various trade-offs between development costs and inference costs as well as the quality of the inference so that is it for the video please check out our paper that goes through a bunch of details over 40 pages including how reasoning emerges in small models as well as results on open source models we provide the code and data from all of our experiments even the smaller ones including a thousand dollars or more worth of teacher inference from open ai for your pleasure we encourage you to take our material for future work also feel free to reach out for discussions thank you for listening and hope to see you at the conference</sample>

usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other

    <sample id="130">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="131">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="135">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or likert scale methods however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="137">hi i'm sisun from the singapore university of technology and design i will share our work named tell to design a dataset for language guided floor plan generation published in acl 2023 recently test-conditional image generation models have demonstrated impressive results in generating high-fidelity images such models generally focus on understanding high-level visual concepts from sentence-level descriptions and the generated images are valid for looking realistic and being creative thereby being more suitable for generating artwork like images with high-level visual concepts from the short text instead of following multiple instructions with various constraints for a specific design when training only on artificial instructions while testing on human instructions our method cannot perform well this indicates there is a language distribution gap between artificial and human instructions nevertheless when artificial instructions are used for warming up before training on human instructions the performance of our method is significantly improved with over 10 io scores increment this suggests that despite the language gap artificial and human instructions are mutually beneficial data portions during training here we provide a case study of different baseline generations conditioned on the same human instructions we can see that although several test-conditional image generation models can produce realistic floor plan images they all fail to align well with the requirements specified in the human instructions to conclude we initiate the research of a novel language-guided design generation task with a specific focus on the floor plan domain as a start and we introduce tell to design a large-scale dataset that features floor plans with neutral language instructions to describe user preferences and we then propose a sequence-to-sequence model as a strong baseline and compare it with several text-conditional image generation models we hope this paper will serve as a foundation and propel further research on the task of language-guided design generation and that's all thanks for the listening</sample>

    <sample id="141">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emily wu andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence which makes corpus-level metrics like ble unable to capture these translations and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model to answer the second question we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part-of-speech tags that have high pcxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high pcxmi and this can be explained because english does not have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="142">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is jawad hussaini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parretti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our dataset if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="144">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare 4 from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english bert model trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on common bear weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here common bear we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="146">hi everyone i'm jiecheng a phd student from fudan university now i will give you a talk about our paper on the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization first i'm going to briefly introduce the background of dialogue summarization dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization it is the process of creating a concise summary that represents the most important information within a dialogue there are many scenarios in dialogue summarization how to extract key information of dialogues in different domains is valuable and worth exploring recent years we have achieved great progress in dialogue summarization especially using large-scale pre-trained language models which can generate fluent and coherent summaries however the generated summaries still suffer from the omission problem which means the generated summaries have missing content that is presented in the gold reference in this task we mainly focus on the utterance level omission and the detection model needs to predict which utterances of dialogues are omitted in the candidate summaries to ensure the quality of labels we also perform human evaluation to assess the quality of generated summaries furthermore we calculate the percentage of gold omission words that are hit in the detected utterances to measure the word-level omission recall denoted as f1 score the figure above shows the label imbalance problem exists in the dataset for the results in the table you can find that the f1 score is around fifty percent this performance indicates that the task is very challenging which calls for more advanced detection models that's all for the introduction if there is any question please contact me thank you</sample>
    <sample id="147">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky to overcome these limitations we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned language models are very good at responding to instructions and prompts so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt so here are some example generations from gpt-4 immediately we see that this is very generalizable to any

    <sample id="148">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and funded by nuno kaesler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right and we compare with popular strategies that are also applied to offline models since their curves are shifted over the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational wall time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="149">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="150">hello everyone i'm archikey and i'll be presenting our acl paper meeting qa extractive question answering on meeting transcripts i'm really thankful to all my collaborators from adobe research and unc chapel hill we know that millions of meetings take place every day worldwide this results in vast amounts of meeting transcripts that can serve as a new domain for nlp research what makes this domain unique and interesting is that meeting transcripts are long documents which are often domain-specific and information-rich however prior works in this area only focus on the task of summarization and extracting action items this means they underutilize the inherently significant qa component in meeting discussions typically a participant in a meeting will ask a question which elicits detailed responses and discussions from others we address this gap by introducing a new dataset called meeting qa which is an extractive question answering dataset based on questions asked by participants in a meeting and the corresponding answer sentences here is an example from meeting qa with the question shown in red and the answers are highlighted in blue as seen in the figure questions asked by participants are bad at identifying rhetorical questions especially in the zero-shot setting to summarize meeting qa is an interesting dataset based on open-ended and discussion-seeking questions in real-life meeting scenarios and the dataset is far from being solved as it is challenging for existing qa models in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings thank you so much for listening and you can find more details on our project page or in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="151">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="152">hello everyone my name is frederik riemenschneider and i am here to talk about our work at the fascinating intersection of nlp and classical philology in this presentation titled exploring large language models for classical philology we will introduce valuable resources for ancient greek and latin moreover we will explore the implications and challenges of multilinguality in these models before we dive in let's take a quick look at the current landscape of language models in classics there have been several models recently developed latin bird was introduced in 2020 then came ancient greek bird in 2021 and another ancient greek bird was released just last year in 2022 so with these advancements it might seem like we are done right well of course not first of all all these models are bird models which means that they are a specific type of encoder-only models moreover these models are all monolingual yet it seems realistic that scholars might want to utilize a model that is proficient in both ancient greek and latin we have undertaken the exciting task of creating new language models specifically designed for classical philology our concrete goals in this project are fourfold to make existing models comparable to push the state of the art further to explore different model architectures and to introduce multilingual models we have pre-trained two monolingual models for ancient greek namely griberta and graeta these models are multilingual equivalents pre-trained on ancient greek latin and english data so in essence we have varied our models along two dimensions language and architecture the first step in building these models is to gather pre-training data for ancient greek previous models have relied on open greek and latin which we naturally also use but in addition we leveraged previously unused resources and to go a step further we have developed a new pre-training corpus from the internet archive the internet archive contains numerous book scans with ocr transcriptions however as we can see in this example the greek text appears as unreadable rubbish because the ocr did not allow greek characters unfortunately most texts have not been ocr'd with settings allowing greek characters and are not tagged as containing greek texts so how can we use the internet archive in a beneficial way our solution is to search for incorrectly transcribed greek stop words such as gar which is often transcribed as yap this method allows us to reliably identify greek texts with this approach our models have elevated lemmatization performance by an impressive five percentage points above the existing state of the art for ancient greek we can also see performance gains for latin lematization is where the real strengths of our encoder-decoder models shine through we did not use a pipeline setting instead we simply inputted the sentence and marked the word to be lemmatized with this approach our models have elevated lematization performance by an impressive five percentage points above the existing state of the art for ancient greek we have also probed our models for their semantic and world knowledge capabilities can our models distinguish synonyms from antonyms furthermore can they identify relations between heroes and gods lastly does our multilingual model perform better because it can learn from three languages results have shown that our models significantly outperform previous models however there doesn't seem to be a significant difference between the performances of the multilingual and the monolingual models to conclude we have presented new powerful language models for classical philology that are initialized from scratch and use a native tokenizer we pre-trained both encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures as well as multilingual models so latin and greek texts can be processed by the same model additionally we have introduced a high-quality pre-training dataset for ancient greek we have rigorously benchmarked previous and our own models we have analyzed how t5's encoder behaves and we have investigated the implications of multilinguality in our language models this video provides only a brief overview of what we did for more details check out our paper thank you for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="153">hello my name is nina remehabi i'm a postdoctoral scientist at amazon alexa ai's responsible ai team and i will present our work resolving ambiguities in text to image models in this work we were interested in studying ambiguities in prompts provided to text to image models and our goal is to propose frameworks to mitigate such ambiguities as well as frameworks to evaluate whether the generated images are faithful to users' intention here is our pipeline first we curate a benchmark dataset that covers different types of ambiguities then these prompts are provided to prompt disambiguation framework that tries to gather external signal to disambiguate a prompt through either asking clarifying questions from the user or generating different possible visual setups and the user will interact with the system and provide the answer that it satisfies its intention we are going to obtain a disambiguated prompt by concatenating the signal to the original ambiguous prompt notice that it's possible that the user can also provide the answer that it satisfies its intention in question format as input to vqa model and we are going to evaluate whether the human's intention is satisfied in the image or not if the answer is yes it means that the user's intention is satisfied so the image is faithful if the answer is no it means that the generation was not faithful to users' intention and we also have additional findings and discussions in the paper so if you are interested please refer to our paper so to conclude in this work we study ambiguities in text to image models we curate a benchmark dataset covering different types of ambiguities and we propose frameworks to both mitigate as well as evaluate ambiguities provided to text to image models so with this i'm going to conclude this talk and thank you so much for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="158">hi my name is jungwon hwang from aws today i will introduce our work dual cache for long document neural coreference resolution so let me first introduce the task of coreference resolution the entities in a document may have multiple mentions across the text the coreference resolution task is to identify the mentions and cluster the mentions that refer to the same entity in this simple example there are three entities and five mentions of them so the goal is to link john with he and link maria with her with this consideration we propose a dual cache that has a local cache and a global cache that they work together the local cache stores local entities with lru eviction policy and the global cache stores global entities with lfu eviction policy which evicts least frequently used entity when the global cache is full to evaluate the capability of dual cache we annotated a book with 30000 words we can see that the performance gap is much larger between the baseline and dual cache for book-level document also we show that dual cache significantly reduces the cache miss compared with a single cache last but not least there are always trade-offs between model efficiency and performance for cache-based models but we show that dual cache has the highest performance cost ratio to conclude dual cache uses a local and global cache to separately store local and global entities it outperforms single cache methods and largely reduces the cache miss also dual cache is the most cost-effective compared with single cache methods so that's all for my talk thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="159">hallo und herzlich willkommen zu unserem talk über unsere acl 2023-papiere language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence and then we can do the same for unacceptability case finally we can choose sentences from a different subset of the data set or a different data set so that is what we call as the mismatch scenario so here the sentences are still coming from relevant data sets but it's not from the same data set that you are evaluating with and we can do the same for unacceptability case finally we can choose sentences from

    <sample id="160">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="161">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored large language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple feasible constraints we propose our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate 55000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models indicating that smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="163">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="164">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data then the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well this implies that weak supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weak supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent weak supervised learning approaches require clean manually annotated samples to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second weak supervised learning approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="165">hello everyone i'm excited to be here to present our recent paper titled adaptive common sense reasoning exploiting mutually exclusive explanations my name is wen ting zhao and i'm a phd student at cornell university before diving into our approach to adaptive reasoning i will first provide a concrete example to help illustrate what it means followed by a more formal definition in adaptive reasoning starts with a context x emily was stuck in traffic and ends with an outcome y emily made it to her flight on time the goal is to identify a plausible subset of the explanations in z therefore we also need an additional regularizer to achieve this to build the regularizer we depend on a significant characteristic of explanations which is their mutual exclusivity in that case preferring a subset of explanations over the others we denote the regularizer by omega and omega takes the max between the entropy of p of z given x y and the log of m where m is the number of plausible explanations when the entropy of p of z given x y is larger than the log of m that means there are more than m explanations received probability mass we then minimize the entropy of p of z given x y in that case preferring a subset of explanations over the others our paper can be found at tinyurlcom slash jal dash lipoor thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="168">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conll 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="170">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the pennsylvania university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and mbert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder decoder models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="171">existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it in watermark injection we first define a target embedding when a user sends a sentence to the provider service with the dataset the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence as shown in the figures the provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence as shown in the figures when the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark we first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset the backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set as shown in the figures the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it is hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="174">hi i'm priya and i'm one of the co-authors of the paper arg analysis 35k a large scale data set for argument quality analysis in this video i'm going to quickly explain why this data set is unique from other data sets that you will find on a similar topic this is just going to be a quick like overview of the special features that we have so do make sure to check out our paper and our poster at the conference for better insight into the results data set collection process data set annotation process etcetera so very quickly what is argument analysis it's simply judging how good or bad an argument is on a scale of zero to one so something like big banks are bad is likely to be rated low but something like big banks have no accountability take heavy risks and lead to major collapses which is why they should be broken up which is a coherent argument which is more persuasive in terms of what it's trying to achieve so normally in data sets you will just have like an argument and connected to a specific motion we think that motions are not like singular that way right arguments like accountability is important can be used in debates about governments churches corporations schools anything accountability is important in all of those places arguments that deal with premise of free speech can be used to defend it for the lgbtq community or defend people's right to protest against a corporation so a relevance model simply assigns a score from zero to one for each of these and like for each theme and just better captures has more arguments and better captures like the relevance that each argument has to a topic right so we think that this data set is just a culmination of like a bunch of unique things and at the end of it you are able to get something that is more diverse that has a score for relevance so you are able to capture how relevant it is to a particular theme you have higher quality of arguments and in general you just have a more reliable scoring because we capture it on instance based level so do make sure to like check out our paper and like give us your feedback on it thanks</sample>
    <sample id="175">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="176">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="177">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it four gigabytes eight gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert trained on four gigabytes of natchez a second version trained on four gigabytes of clinical notes and finally a first version of schubert which is a clinical model trained on four gigabytes of clinical notes in addition to this comparison we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weight and tokenizer of dr bert trained on the four gigabytes of natchez another also based on dr bert but trained this time on the four gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on four gigabytes of clinical notes in total we have seven models to evaluate all seven models we gathered which for public and private down-stream tasks such as name entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to six baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes common bert 64 gigabytes oscar bert and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those uh on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from uh we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total from scratch pre-training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks however our experiment on continuous pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of dr bert trained on the four gigabytes of natchez shows comparable results to those obtained with uh dr bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on common bert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion uh our proper system offers better performance on nine of the eleven down-stream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that uh specialize data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available and uh on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="178">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller tanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="179">hi everyone i'm melanie sclar and i'll talk about mining language models lack of theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models we present symbolic tom a plug-and-play method to improve theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models using explicit graphical representations symbolic tom uses several graphical representations since mental states cannot be represented with a single graph for example on the left we see a representation of what bob believes is the current world state and on the right we see a representation of what bob thinks that alice believes is the current world state we call these graphs b-bob and a-alice in general performance results for second order false belief questions and all others can be found in the paper for testing our method generalization capabilities we designed two new datasets both modifying the tommi benchmark we test for story structure generalization by for example concatenating two stories and asking half the time about the first story and half the time about the second one this is the d1 dataset and we designed two more d2 and d3 we also test for linguistic generalization which is our second dataset called paraphrase tommi generating a dataset that has more linguistic diversity this is important since tommi is generated automatically with only one way of phrasing each sentence for the story structure generalization datasets we observe that supervised models heavily degrade the performance on the three datasets we created for example showing around 50 performance in the dataset d1 that i just described on the other hand using symbolic tom still shows significant gains for all models allowing stronger models like gpt-4 to fully solve the datasets giving for example a 42 point accuracy boost for dataset d1 so in conclusion we introduced symbolic tom a plug-and-play method to improve theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models it is an inference time algorithm which avoids overfitting risk it uses explicit graphical symbolic representation which yields more interpretable reasoning and symbolic tom dramatically improves out-of-the-box llm performance outperforming supervised approaches on out-of-domain story understanding and remaining beneficial on the new linguistic diversity dataset paraphrase tommi for more details please refer to the paper and don't hesitate to reach out to chat thank you so much for listening</sample>
    <sample id="180">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so when people are describing a woman they'll usually actually specify woman and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance um there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure um on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening um have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="182">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with esendermush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our method we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned language models are very good at responding to instructions and prompts so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt so we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt so we can immediately

    <sample id="184">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emilio uh andrew f d martins and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in translation in this work we try to answer these two questions first when does translation require context and second how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we started by measuring how much a word depends on context in translation in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model in this work we extend cxmi to pointwise cxmi which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level we can then um also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a

    <sample id="185">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model named bert and trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which public and private down-stream tasks such as named entity recognition classification part-of-speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to six baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes common bert and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total from scratch training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="187">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="188">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them prc here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple cold start active learning strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting active learning with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="189">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="190">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as a service via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as a service currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as a service is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as a service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as a service to protect the copyright of embedding as a service one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as a service second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as a service third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's service during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as a service or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as a service the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="191">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simultaneous st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the cross attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the cross attention is above a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in german and we also see that if we look at the main results of the dot we plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we compare also with the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous speech translation these are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on german and we see that uh dot outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models since their curves are shifted over the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational wall time dot is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="195">hello everyone today i will introduce our work reasoning over hierarchical question decomposition tree for explainable question answering explainable question answering aims to answer a given question and provide an explanation why the answer is selected recent work in explainable question answering can be grouped into two directions neuro-symbolic methods which translate natural language questions into formal representations such as sparql and decomposition-based methods which generate natural language intermediate steps that lead to the final answer however both of them have limitations for neuro-symbolic methods the formal representation can only be executed on structured knowledge bases and the diversity of natural language makes explainable question answering difficult for decomposition-based methods the only source of knowledge is the text corpus at different levels of the decomposition tree after building the hqdt we can solve the complex question we are conducting probabilistic reasoning over the hqdt the reasoning process is from the root to the leaves in a recursive way and contains three steps for each node firstly a scheduler will determine the appropriate knowledge sources for this node the sources include a knowledge base a text corpus or solving its children recursively and sequentially secondly the corresponding executors will get the answers with probabilities from the selected knowledge sources the aggregator will aggregate the candidate answers from all the knowledge sources and output top k answers with the highest probabilities demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing knowledge from kb that's all thanks for your listening</sample>
    <sample id="196">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination is lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="197">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="198">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="199">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the pennsylvania university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual few-shot transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boosts the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="200">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="201">the insights that we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of parm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but parm comes pretty close to a commercial system in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of parm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy in particular the most common errors are omission errors so it seems that parm chooses to produce a better-sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style awkward category for parm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that parm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="202">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we do observe poor generalization what causes the performance drop of these models so what about adaptive overfitting which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="204">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual few-shot transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="205">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="206">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them cee here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 062 further on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning of cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold start the active learning process feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="208">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first use a lexicon of stereotypes and essentializing narratives we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes and essentializing narratives than the human written ones however when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon we find very different things so while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="209">hi i'm xia jian from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge with large language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge and show that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as making a cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple constraints a good planner should generate scripts that are reasonable and faithful to the constraints in this paper we adopt the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning data sets from large language models we apply our method for building a data set of constrained language planning named as co-script we can trace smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we find that t5 fine-tuned on co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most of large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable data sets in summary a way established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset named co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="210">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="211">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>

    <sample id="213">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks we use all the instances in the test split for each task we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment we report the mean and max performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments if the task is a multi-modal classification task we report accuracy if it's a multi-modal generation task we report rouge-l as well we also introduced a additional evaluation metric called sensitivity uh so this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same output for the same task regardless of the slight variation in the wording of the instruction we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional language tasks and we will release them so uh this is a qr code for our uh data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="215">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from red to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from red to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen treebank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and uh also the observation that was made in passing that uh this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect grows with the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination then the net uh this effect disappears so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we showed in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="217">hello everyone i'm getting to introduce our work here seen to unseen exploring compositional generation for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation and we have some models that work with the compositional prompt module to effectively use control signals we have designed two types of prompts that use trivial related information from the pre-trained language model the first is a trivial oriented prompt we use the combination of controllable trivial values corresponding to each instance as prompt to guide the model to focus on the specific information in the dialogue the second is task oriented prompt although trivial oriented prompt can capture the instance specific control signals the dialogue response generation task is also guided by the instance independent global features we use we use three correlation coefficients to evaluate the quality of different metrics including our automatic metrics mae compared to human judgments our method outperforms classic metrics for both coarse-grained discrete attributes and fine-grained continuous attributes we test various of mae and found removing the continuous prompts decrease the correlation score since the task-oriented prompts are the only parameters that can be fine-tuned and are therefore important for mae we also implemented mae on another pim bird to show its generalization we demonstrate the impact of prompts on compositional generation with a visualization of the compositional prompt embedding of three attributes via pca on dialogue daily dialogue cg as shown in this figure these results prove that our method can distangle attribute combinations and learn the relations between different attributes with the ability to generalize from seen attributes to unseen combinations our proposed method outperformed models that learn an independent prompt for each attribute value with a shared embedding mapping help learn attribute concepts from seen values to unseen combinations this is the conclusion we studied compositional generalization dialogue for multiple attributes and proposed a prompt-based distangled attribute dialogue model</sample>

    <sample id="219">hi everyone i'm jian wei chen a research assistant at academia sinica i will present our work a compare and contrast multi-stage pipeline for uncovering financial signals in financial reports this work is done with yishan huang and wen wen and our advisors professor chia-liang chen and professor yi-cheng wu i will talk about the background of financial report analysis which is the goal of this work and text definition and our approaches this work is motivated by two observations first we observed that the words in a company's report are very similar about 80 of the tokens are the same and the contents are very dependent this figure illustrates the text similarity between two reports in the continuous years for example the report in 2018 is similar to the one in 2017 based on the observation we introduce a highlighted task and a multi-stage pipeline stage 0 is document segmentation stage 1 is the relation combination stage 2 and stage 2 plus are in-domain finetuning is a natural language inference dataset with token annotation for example the word frontier is the visionary according to the context of this pair for in the finetuning we use the revised pairs the revised words as pseudo-positive labels and we randomly label few other words as negative in addition we mix different objectives we use the soft-leveling techniques by mixing cross-entropy loss and kl-divergence therefore we can alleviate the problem from low-quality labels this table shows that our dominantive highlighting model achieve the best performance on final and even preserve the generalization capability as you can see the performance on esnli we further observe that our methods can benefit on simulation the mismatched pairs which we didn't use during training in conclusion we propose a highlighted task with our released finetuning dataset and a simple pipeline with two stage finetuning there are many other future works we would like to try including improving our effectiveness or adding more features or like many other techniques in information retrieval can enhance the application as well yeah that's it so please refer to our paper and github for more details and feel free to ask us if you have any question thank you</sample>
    <sample id="220">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected thus far we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="222">hi everyone the title of this work is to adapt or to annotate challenges and interventions in open domain question answering to motivate this work let's look at this question what is produced in the plants of narora kakrapur tharapur so in open domain qa setting we need to first look up relevant passages from a document corpus in this case which is wikipedia with some retriever model uh then a reader model takes the question and all the relevant passages as input to generate the answer as nuclear power which is the correct prediction please note that both the retriever and the reader models are trained on a general purpose domain like wikipedia now let's say we want to answer a biomedical question in that case wikipedia corpus can probably answer a few domain specific questions since it's a general purpose domain we could also replace wikipedia corpus with biomedical corpus but that may not be sufficient as these domains are often very sparse and the source model is trained on wikipedia corpus so here no shift is when both source retriever and reader are compatible with the target domain now concept shift happens when retriever is able to find the right passage but the type of reasoning the source reader needs is not actually same as the one source model has learned full shift is the reverse of concept where the retriever has a hard time identifying the right passage but when the reader gets the right passage uh it's able to answer the question to vary answer distribution we pull passages from source and target domain we compare existing retriever models and find that the learn methods are sensitive to change in distribution while an unsupervised method like bm25 has the best overall performance now moving on to the second part how do we ascertain the nature of incompatibility the target model and domain exhibits we consider existing data shift taxonomy in machine learning to understand the nature of shift in target data set with respect to source model so here no shift is when both source retriever and reader are compatible with the target domain now concept shift is when retriever is able to find the right passage but the type of reasoning the source reader needs is not actually same as the one source model has learned full shift is when neither retriever nor reader are compatible now we need some way to measure compatibility so what we do is we take some fixed number of question answer and context triples from target data set and then compute the likelihood let's say likelihood the source retriever model assigns to all context in the set now the probability assigned to the gold context is considered as a measure of compatibility the higher is this value the more compatible is the source model for the target data set for reader we do a similar thing where we compute the likelihood of all the answers in the fixed set for each question and then normalize over all answer likelihoods to get a single value we just average the compatibility values over all examples in the set now that we have our compatibility measure we can basically map different target data sets under each category of the shift and find what type of data intervention would be most useful for them we find that all target sets respond well to few shot adaptations as they use a few examples from target domain while data sets with concept and covariate shift respond well to zero shot adaptations as well as in case of no shift we don't observe a lot of changes in performance because source model already understands the target domain to a great extent to conclude we experiment with a variety of data interventions and improve reader performance by up to 24 we also show that only certain data types of data interventions are effective based on the type of shift a target data set exhibits thank you</sample>
    <sample id="223">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="225">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="227">we all know that language models have achieved great success recently providing a general solution to many different nlp tasks here we want to ask what's missing in current language models research we think the answer to this question is grounded language understanding which basically means grounding a natural language expression into something that can be executed over a specific target environment which is also referred to as a plan or a program so there are many applications to grounded language understanding such as smart assistants like siri and alexa and also semantic search on google and querying a medical database using natural language and also domestic robots that follow natural language instructions so all these applications involve mapping a natural language expression onto some representation in a specific environment for example like when querying a medical database using natural language to discrimination might be a much better strategy of using language models for grounded language understanding we are always open to different forms of discussions and collaborations and also we are eager to hear your thoughts on our work we appreciate your time and your attention thanks a lot</sample>
    <sample id="228">existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it in watermark injection we first define a target embedding when a user sends a sentence to the provider service with the dataset the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence as shown in the figures the provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence as shown in the figures when the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark we first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset the backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set as shown in the figures the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it is hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="229">hello everyone my name is gabrielle skidmore and today i'm going to present our joint work with henning wachsmuth on detecting suboptimal claims for argumentative writing support let's start with a brief introduction into revision of text and why they are important revision is an essential part of professional writing and is typically a recursive process until some optimal phrasing is achieved from the author's point of view as such optimal phrasing is essential for effectively communicating a message in order to stimulate a desired reaction to get a better understanding of what this process can look like let's follow the revision process of the claim found below stated as cell phones cause brain cancer in the first revision the author further specifies that it's cell phone radiation that causes brain cancer and in the second revision the claim is further clarified that it's not definitive and is changed to cell phone radiation may cause brain cancer the final challenge we look at is topic and user bias collaborative revision histories contain noise and it could be due to accidental mistakes or biases of users and moderators not only can debate topics be highly controversial and require specific knowledge and expertise but also certain argument quality dimensions such as for example effectiveness depend on the social and cultural context of the writer and audience which makes determining the quality of the text even more difficult to find out how we tackle each of the four challenges we invite you to read our paper where we present detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of strategies tackling each challenge and a systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced tasks based on our experiments we can conclude that a revision based data can be effectively used for the given tasks moreover modeling the distance between two claim versions is beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims and finally the impact of contextual information is dependent on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from for further details and findings please refer to our paper and thank you for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="233">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and fondecyl bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo daniele and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where the attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="235">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multilingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emilio uh andrew f d martins and gram new big so a lot of translations depend on context in translation in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model in this work we extend cxmi to pointwise cxmi and this helps us identify cases like the one here where in chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="236">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="240">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision you do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well in weak supervised learning we address this research question in our work and our findings are as follows first we find that interestingly recent weak supervised learning methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly otherwise there is a large performance drop as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we show that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="241">hi everyone i'm ethan and today i'm going to discuss our paper human-in-the-loop evaluation for early misinformation detection a case study of covid-19 treatments this was a joint work with yang chen wei shu and alan gitter at georgia tech there have been many proposed approaches for automatically detecting misinformation on social media platforms however all of these approaches generally fall short on two key marks firstly these systems are often unrealistically evaluated for example data sets used for the evaluation of these systems are often retrospectively constructed instead of using live data relatedly there is the possibility of leaked counter-evidence which a recent work found was a problem with many of these systems for example for this evidence-based fact-checking approach we see that while in this first case counter-evidence could clearly be found on a well-known data source like wikipedia for the second more realistic case of misinformation counter-evidence could only exist after the claim had been debunked publicly at which case the system is not useful now we move on to the evaluation of our human-in-the-loop workflow from some of the discussion of leaked counter-evidence early detection is an important task to right as humans can act more effectively to stem the spread of misinformation the histrogram of scores are shown below where scores of four or five indicate most likely or clearly violating twitter's policies surrounding covid-19 misinformation thank you so much for listening and we hope to answer any questions you may have at the conference finally our work valuably provides an outsider's or out-of-industry look at the development and evaluation of misinformation detection systems which can now be evaluated consistently with the methods that we present in this paper finally our work valuably provides an outsider's or out-of-industry look at the development and evaluation of misinformation detection systems</sample>
    <sample id="242">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="245">hi i'm lin lin jiang today i'm going to present our work a needle in a haystack an analysis of high agreement workers on mturk for summarization below are our co-authors the picture in the middle shows the two-step pipeline for finding high agreement mturk workers as well as the qualification settings the motivation of the pipeline is that automatic metrics are sometimes problematic and the best practice for recruitment on mturk are also poorly understood so we are going to present this work as shown in all here start with the qualification settings then the two steps of qualification task and endurance task we are also going to include the reference based task is designed to test the annotators' ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly it includes both the training part and the qualification part the qualification questions include three documents one document check and four candidate summaries each to check the information coverage in two directions our pipeline workers' result shows that eight out of twelve mturk workers finished all hits and the figure on the right shows the kappa between different workers and the krippendorff's alpha is 0534 as for the baseline mturk workers we tried different approaches and the best one is achieved by the statistical filter called mace the threshold of 05 the krippendorff's alpha is 038 but with incomplete hit coverage and fewer workers per hit in the future we are going to investigate ways to hire high quality workers both in terms of high agreement and correctness and we are going to try multiple applications for task languages and platforms there are also some limitations for this work first only english summarization and mturk platform is tested second the designed task questions are not perfect solutions third there is no guarantee for the training of correctness finally we want to thank google for the experiment fundings and thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="247">hello this is jill king from kaitai and i will present our paper titled factg fact verification via reasoning on knowledge graphs do you know of existing fact verification datasets there are datasets such as fever and vitamin c which use wikipedia text however there was no dataset that utilized knowledge graphs as evidence with natural language claims to this end we introduce a new dataset factg fact verification via reasoning on knowledge graphs the knowledge graph used is dbpedia and claims exist in two styles written and colloquial for more practical use two methods were used for this first the colloquial style transfer model proposed in chemito is used this is an example second presupposition templates were created and used presupposition is what we usually say assuming that it is true or false when we speak we use this concept and these are the examples this is the statistics of our dataset finally we constructed some baselines in two ways claim-only baselines use only the claims to verify without graph evidence and we utilize the gearing model to verify the claim using graph evidence and as a result all of the baselines outperform the majority class baseline which is fifty one percent and the gearing model that uses graph evidence outperforms all other baselines this is the summary of our paper thank you for listening you can download our dataset and feel free to contact me</sample>

    <sample id="249">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller tanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="250">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="251">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="252">welcome to our presentation my name is saikiran thanikella i am a master's student at iit kanpur i am excited to present our work you create unsupervised case retrieval using event extraction this is a joint work along with abhinav sharma and ashish sharma legal professionals such as lawyers and judges have traditionally relied on their experience to cite relevant past precedents known as cited documents however with the increasing volume of cases it becomes very challenging this is where the task of prior case retrieval comes to play given a legal query document and candid documents are sequentially given as input into the event extraction block for further processing the event extraction block consists of three steps pre-processing dependency parsing and post-processing for each document we obtain the extracted events then we compute an interaction matrix between the query and candid events the green blocks represent the common events further the interaction matrix is used in different retrieval models to obtain a ranking order of the candid documents in the event filtered documents model we filter the original corpus so that it contains only the sentences which produce matching events with other documents note that all event-based models perform significantly above the baseline the event filtered docs is the best performing model for more experiments and results please check out our paper in terms of performance the method using event filtered documents outperforms all other methods with a significant boost this graph compares the performance of various event-based methods with the baseline from this plot we can observe that event-based models have lower inference time and higher f1 score compared to the other techniques here is a performance comparison on the colie data set you create outperforms the existing approaches including the recent supervised approach by mtft bird team to the best of our knowledge this approach is the current state-of-the-art method for the colie 21 document retrieval task in conclusion with these significant contributions you create opens up avenues for further exploration and development in the field of prior case retrieval please check out our paper for more details that's all from our side thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="253">hello everyone my name is mario eder dragon and i'm going to present our work named disorder a double domain adaptation model for detecting signs of mental disorders in social media this is a group effort of researchers from mexico and spain first i want to start with the definition of a mental disorder that is a psychological syndrome which is associated with the distress and disability that affect your thinking feeling mood and behavior there are different types of mental disorders for example major depression ptsd bulimia and anorexia and among others nowadays social media content is massive and provides an opportunity to do research on how people undergo difficulties many people use online platforms to publicly share their daily routines and important events while others take advantage of the anonymity of these spaces to explicitly discuss mental health issues and seek help in this work we aim to contribute to the detection of mental disorders by automatically analyzing their social media posts this type of analysis is expected to support a new technology able to warn about the onset of mental disorders and provide supporting evidence let us illustrate the behavior of the learned model and the kind of textual segments it tends to pay more attention to first we use a lexicon to guide the masking process the model tends to be biased toward words related to anxiety and medication topics that are highly relevant to depression as conclusion and future work the combined effect of double domain adaptation and guided masking is effective at capturing signs of mental disorders in social media interactions our approach also obtains better results than those achieved by mental work a model trained with a large amount of data the evaluation shows a solid balance between finding users and labeling them correctly in future work we want to explore the application of different lexical resources as well as using clinical data thank you for your attention if you have any questions please feel free to ask me</sample>

    <sample id="257">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="258">hi everyone i'm zhangsong han thank you for watching this video in this video i'm going to talk about our new work can large language models be an alternative to human evaluations in this work we propose to use large language models to evaluate the quality of samples in other natural language processing tasks so we just give the large language models the instructions and we give them the samples that need to be rated and the human can rate the samples based on the instructions but in fact when we submitted this paper to acl there are no prior works that explore the idea of large language model evaluation so our idea was quite novel at the time of submission and the motivation of this work is in the past we often use human evaluations to evaluate the quality of samples in other natural language processing tasks so we give the large language models the instructions and we give them the samples that need to be rated and the human can rate the samples based on the instructions but in fact when we submitted this paper to acl there are no prior works that explore the idea of large language model evaluation so our idea was quite novel at the time of submission and all these questions are answered in our paper so if you are interested in this topic please read our paper or you can come to our posters then at acl and that's all for this video and thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="259">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the pennsylvania university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder decoder models such as coder decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of fueled on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coder and blue are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="260">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embedding and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="262">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple specific constraints we apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate 55000 specific goals with scripts in total we establish the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use a large language models to generate a high-quality dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script dataset can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="263">hi today i'm going to present our work mitigating label biases for in-context learning in-context learning is a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models however such in-context learning ability is known to be unstable due to various design choices such as the choice and order of in-context examples prior work shows that in-context learning ability is unstable due to various design choices such as the choice and order of in-context examples and finally we propose the novel calibration method to handle all type of biases so for any classification task we consider the following setups where we have a context that consists of a sequence of labeled examples we have the text we want to classify and also we have some label names we want the model to predict on each of the label names and then use this estimated bias to calibrate the model's original predictions prior calibration method uses some single predefined tokens like not available to a random english words showing that this predefined token can also be biased and then instead of using a single word using more random words leads to further improvement showing that it is suboptimal to use only a single context free tokens and finally by using random in-domain words rather than random english words to take into account the domain label bias we are able to achieve further large improvements so to understand why is domain context calibration better than previous calibration attempts we conduct comprehensive ablation studies so first we observe an improvement by replacing the single predefined tokens like not available to a random english words showing that this predefined token can also be biased and then instead of using a single word using more random words leads to further improvement showing that it is suboptimal to use only a single context free tokens and finally by using random in-domain words rather than random english words to take into account the domain label bias we are able to achieve further large improvements so to summarize in this work we propose a systematic investigation of the label bias problems in in-context learning we start with the typology of label bias and based on which we are able to identify a new important source of biases in in-context learning and finally we propose the calibration method that is able to significantly improve the performance of in-context learning of those large language models check our paper for more details and thank you</sample>
    <sample id="264">hi everyone my name is jing wang and i'm a graduate student at georgia institute of technology today i will give a presentation for my paper titled transferable audio-visual task generation let's get started currently multimodal task generation tasks like machine translation and image captioning have already flourished as a result of the large-scale pre-training and huge model capacity however for multimodal task like audio-visual text generation the main challenge is the multimodal to monomodal shift like visual style audio energy and so on also there's a lack of labeled data for training the model so we propose transferable audio-visual task generation for some low-resource domains with only a few labeled data such as kids and beauty other methods suffer from severe performance degradation while our method still performs well additionally we conducted experiments to analyze the impact of audio features and spanning comments okay that's all thank you</sample>
    <sample id="265">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them cee here we find that on transferring the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 062 further on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold start the active learning process feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="266">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from read to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from read to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap uh these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen treebank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and uh also the observation that was made in passing that uh this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect grows with the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination then the net uh this effect disappears so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we showed in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>

    <sample id="269">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or liker scale methods however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods liker ratings on the turn level liker ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="271">in this video i would like to present our recent work on weakly supervised learning a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning approaches to address this problem setting but this implies that additional manual annotations are required in wsl approaches to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help wsl approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="272">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show a like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentences and similar ways that is when we choose sentences from the same dataset or a different dataset so that is what we call as the minimal pair judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="273">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context and secondly because a data-driven multi-lingual translation system which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="274">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the pennsylvania university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="276">hi everyone this is ananya and vignesh presenting our work on indicmt val a dataset to meta evaluate machine translation metrics for indian languages for the translation task there are several evaluation metrics proposed for evaluating two english translations also there are many studies that perform meta evaluation of these metrics by analyzing their correlation with human scores or discussing the advantages and shortcomings of each of them but what about translations in the other direction evaluation of translations in the other direction is understudied but it is important to study evaluation metrics for other languages instead of naively adopting the metrics proposed for english other languages have their own grammar rules some novel aspects like shared and borrowed vocab dialectic differences and certain settings different sentence structures and varying amounts of resources among other differences our aim is to fill this gap so in this work we focus on indian languages more specifically we study five languages belonging to two different language families we have tamil and malayalam which are dravidian languages and hindi marathi and gujarati which are indo-aryan languages so from the indicmt val a dataset we select 200 sentences randomly to generate multiple candidate translations for each of these source sentences in english we feed it to seven different translation models or apis so using seven such translation systems we get a total of 1400 candidate translations for all languages so almost all metrics show a higher correlation with human scores when only accuracy errors are annotated so having analyzed various metrics we fine-tune the best performing metrics on fluency and accuracy subsets for all languages so

    <sample id="277">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="278">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essemdermush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups furthermore most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="279">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="280">hi everyone i'm shota today is my great honor to share my work multimodal fusion framework for emotion recognition in conversations the goal of emotion regulation in conversations is to predict the emotion label of each utterance in a dialogue each utterance has its corresponding textual audio and visual modalities to address this problem we propose a novel multimodal fusion framework named multimode which is made up of three components multimode text multimode audio and multimode video each of which aims to integrate one modality with complementary information from the other two modalities through stacked bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers to fuse the textual modality with visual cues figure 7 depicts a visualization of heatmap of wrongly classified utterances in multimode which demonstrates the superiority of multimode in difficult scenarios where the emotional tendencies from different modalities are asynchronized multimode also has some limitations first multimode does not distinguish between speaker and irrelevant people in the same second the swfc laws require a large batch size on multimode and finally the performance of multimode in minority emotions are still worse than majority classes that's all thank you so much for listening</sample>
    <sample id="281">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multilingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for the target y given the source x and this can be explained because english doesn't have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis resolution so this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models perform best and if we use commet context-aware models perform best and if we use wordf measure then models with and without context have comparable performance this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="282">hello everyone i'm xiaohua jiang and today i'm excited to present our new work in stylo 2023 story trends non-parallel story author style transfer with discourse representations from the source text and combine these with normal style embeddings to generate text in the target styles we have also designed a new training objective to reduce the stylistic features from the discourse orientations putting the information derived from the different texts closer in the latent space and moreover to enhance the content preservation we separate the generation into two stages first we transfer the source text with the style-specific content keywords masked out and then generate the whole text by incorporating this keyword's sparsity as for the second stage this stage is unrelated to the style transfer which aims to fill the correct the style-specific content and remove the mask tokens and finally we can get the transferred text as we can see the evaluation and data sets we collected new data sets in chinese and english for these new tasks and we conducted intensive experiments to transfer the fairy tales or aerial story to typical author styles both automatic evaluation results and manual evaluations confirm the efficiency of our model and showing that our style transfer outperforms baseline in terms of style control and content preservation and furthermore style visualization indicates the transferred text by our solutions are also aligned with the golden text in the style feature space and this is our all works and finally our data and code included in this this report if you have any question please don't wait to email me</sample>
    <sample id="283">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures uh grows uh the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is uh we have that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left in this example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside uh external governor right so in such cases uh the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts uh grows uh the tendency grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we show that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left in this example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside uh external governor right so in such cases uh the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts uh grows uh the tendency grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we show in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about uh the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="284">hello everyone i'm pang pang xu from wuhan university today i will present my long paper for acl main conference four thousand nine hundred and fifteen titled fssuie a novel fuzziness band mechanism for enhancing universal information extraction the current band-based ui model involves identifying and labeling the band boundaries of the target in the text which heavily relies on boundary positions of annotated bands however there is ambiguity in labeling the fuzziness band boundaries that is different annotations bands can be considered reasonable so we propose that the fuzziness band attention layer should be adaptive rather than static in order to model the fuzziness band distribution the image and formula of the mask function g are shown in the slide where the fuzziness band is reflected in two aspects on the one hand by introducing an optimizable parameter delta to adjust the length of the fuzziness band range the fuzziness band of the model is dynamically changing and then we propose efficient fuzziness band attention to adaptively adjusting the fuzziness band of the model and the fssuie we proposed achieves excellent results in a wide range of ai tasks thank you for your listening in conclusion in this work we first proposed a novel fuzziness band mechanism that alleviates the model's reliance on band boundaries and then we propose efficient fuzziness band attention to adaptively adjusting the attention span of the model and the fssuie we proposed achieves excellent results in a wide range of ai tasks thank you for your listening</sample>
    <sample id="285">hello everyone i'm mingjie liu from pitt university i'm glad to share our work reference methods benchmarking factor error correction for dialogue summarization with fvc evaluation framework this video focuses on the key points of our work as we all know summaries generated by models and even some reference summaries still contain factual errors and there are two main types of solutions the first is to introduce factual error related objectives in the training or inference process to make the summarization models more factual and the second is to design a factual error correction model abbreviated as fvc which is independent of the summarization model it takes the source document and the model generated summary as inputs and outputs a score it is expected that the average score of the corrected summaries are higher than the original ones the higher the score the better the fvc models are the introduction of reference summaries during the training of fvc models for dialogue summarization can improve their performance combining human annotated data with synthetic data is a promising direction and current fvc models struggle to correct factual errors by addition and cannot address attribute errors modality errors link errors etc thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="286">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="287">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="288">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="290">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well in weak supervised learning we address this problem by proposing training algorithms to robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize well beyond the original weakly labeled data to summarize we show that recent weak supervised learning approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second weak supervised learning approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in weak supervised learning finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="294">since its release in 2018 bert has become one of the most effective approaches to solve natural language processing tasks in french and offers huge performance gains compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as word2vec fasttext or elmo in addition to this comparison we introduced three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy uh one based on the weights and tokenizer of bert trained on the 4gb subset of natchez another also based on the weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues and finally as a conclusion uh our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 downstream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here camembert we also observed that uh specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available and uh on yugenface and all the training scripts are on g uh our github repository so thank you for uh for uh for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="295">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination is lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="296">hi i am valerio vasile and in this video i am going to present a work which is a fruit of a collaboration between the university of turin and amazon alexa natural language understanding and natural language processing in general is based in a large part on supervised machine learning or the so-called data-driven approaches and in order to be able to develop these approaches we need a lot of data large sets of manually annotated data which encode some kind of human knowledge which the annotators put into the data by their process of annotation lately there is a series of works which have been showing that the assumption that there is one single truth what's called the ground truth and the annotation needs to converge towards it is showing some limits we chose to focus on irony in particular which is a highly latent and pragmatic phenomenon in natural language irony detection is already a very difficult task for modern natural language processing models and we want to investigate this problem further rather than training models that are able to say something like a binary label like this sentence is ironic or is not ironic we observed a significant difference in the confidence that the perspective aware models show and in particular we can see how the perspective models are on average less uncertain more confident of their predictions finally we went again into the data and we tried to look at what may be the causes of the differences in the annotations and we found something peculiar that is that in the case of age it is generations that are close to each other that seem to be more in disagreement toward their perception of irony and similar things happen in the geographical distribution of the annotators where we found that the highest variations in response is given between the two models trained on labels given by annotators from the united kingdom and ireland this is it for this short presentation but we will be happy to answer all your questions and having further discussions at the poster session</sample>

    <sample id="298">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to new data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of the downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="299">hi everyone my name is mihalis karakasgis today we are here to talk about improving the robustness of nli models with minimax training this is joint work with andreas lajos at the university of cambridge nli models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a plethora of benchmarks however despite rapid progress nli models suffer from poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets with patterns that could predict the shortcuts present in the dominant easy examples both models are optimized in an alternating fashion using any standard optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent at test time the learner can make predictions without relying on the auxiliary we evaluate our proposed method in three commonly used nli datasets mnli fever and qqp and the corresponding out-of-distribution test sets hans symmetry and pulse here we observe that compared to an erm trained model as well as the best performing shortcut mitigation method in each dataset the minimax training objective consistently improves out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy finally in our paper we also examine whether the performed improvements transfer to larger models synthetic shortcuts and out-of-distribution test sets what is the effect of pre-training the learner how small the auxiliary needs to be and finally we conduct a qualitative evaluation of the learner's example weight distribution if you find this work interesting we would love to chat with you during our post session thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="300">hi my name is belinda and the work i'll be presenting today introduces a task called interactive dictation and makes initial steps towards solving this task this is work done at semantic machines in collaboration with jason eisner adam pauls and sam thompson so what is interactive dictation at a high level interactive dictation is a process where users can use their voice to both dictate and edit a document in a natural and intuitive manner in this example a user starts by dictating just wanted to ask about the event on the twenty third this is transcribed verbatim into the text box however in the middle of speaking the user realizes they made a mistake and corrects themselves saying on friday the twenty third ideally the system can pick up that this was a speech correction and replace the correct span with a new utterance in summary our contribution is threefold first we introduce and formalize a new task interactive dictation second we design a data collection interface and build a data set for this task and finally we create a baseline system that performs each of these four steps we train a model to perform each of these steps you can see the paper for more details but in particular for the interpretation model we experiment with two different architectures t5 and gpt-3 and two different types of outputs we either have the model predict programs that can be executed into the next state or we have it directly predict the next state first for the segmentation model we see that it's both fairly accurate and efficient next we evaluate the asr repair and interpretation models jointly using exact match of the predicted end state against the gold end state we find that there is generally a trade-off between runtime and accuracy and that generally gpt-3 models are more accurate but also much slower furthermore for gpt-3 models predicting state directly is much more accurate than predicting programs allows us to significantly improve efficiency with minimal impact on accuracy as you can see however there's clearly much more room for progress here and we welcome more work on this task to facilitate future work we have released code at the following site please also check out the paper for more details</sample>
    <sample id="302">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="303">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in large language models this work is done in collaboration with essender mush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our method we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned lms are very good at responding to instructions and prompts so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt so here are some example generations from gpt-4 immediately we see that while the outputs aren't overtly negative or toxic in the traditional sense of these words they're really just only the positive or at least non-negative ones and in fact the lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all so instead to do that we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these seemingly positive portrayals facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="304">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="305">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="310">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context please read our paper for more details that is when we perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to the latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="311">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document-level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence-level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="312">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning data set with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="314">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination is lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination to the right this effect disappears so we showed that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we showed in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="315">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with esendermush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups furthermore most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="316">hi i'm si jian from funan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored large language models for planning for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as making a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with multi-faceted constraints a good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints in this paper we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as code-script in total we generate 55000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of code-script we find that code-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models indicating that smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning can support large language models when properly trained on suitable datasets in summary a way established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use a large language models to generate a high quality dataset of constrained language planning we hope code-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of code-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="317">hello everyone i'm from university i'm very delighted to present our work titled code generation models about textual information extraction the information extraction is a classic task in natural language processing it refers to extracting structured information from input text to this function we add a command extract named entities from input text to this function furthermore we observe that when decoding with gpt-3 and test format prompts there are many structural errors whereas when using code format prompts such errors were almost non-existent we advocate that transforming information extraction into a code generation task and using code format prompts aligns better with the information extraction task itself furthermore we found that regardless of prompt format the code format model outperformed the gpt-3 model in information extraction tasks overall furthermore we cataloged the model used using code format prompts performed better than test format prompts especially in terms of recall we hope this analysis can provide some inspiration to everyone lastly thank you all if you have any questions please feel free to contact me our paper and code are made publicly available</sample>
    <sample id="318">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natschos a second version of 4 gigabytes of natschos a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of natschos in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which are public and private down-stream tasks such as named entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to six baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 gigabytes common bert 4 gigabytes common bert 64 gigabytes our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="319">in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article which is dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domains and finally we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the models since its release in 2018 bert has become one of the most effective approaches to solve natural language processing tasks in french and offers huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as word2vec fasttext or elmo in addition to this comparison we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weights and tokenizer of bert trained on the 4gb subset of natchez another also based on the weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues and finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here camomber we also observe that the specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="320">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to new data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of the downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our dataset and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="321">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="322">hi everyone i'm enrico and i will be presenting at acl 23 answering the question what does a text classifier learn about morality first of all let me explain you what is morality human morality is what helps us distinguish right from wrong is our internal compass that helps us determine whether an action or a concept is morally right or morally wrong and morality is at the base of our societies obviously and it is essential that language models can understand and recognize morality in text in particular we focus on understanding how morality is expressed differently across different domains we use a dataset called moral foundation twitter corpus composed of 35000 tweets collected in seven different domains domains for examples corresponding to the hashtag all lives matter or the hashtag black lives matter these two domains have a similar rhetoric right because they cover similar topics but they have a significantly different rhetoric for the moral element of subversion which means rebellion to authority we know intuitively and we found that language models recognize that in alm subversion is associated with words that you know such as overthrow mayhem and subversion is frowned upon whereas in blm subversion is somewhat encouraged so language models do recognize that morality can be expressed differently in different domains and using just one single model for many different domains can actually lead to misunderstandings of morality in a very dangerous way i hope to see you at acl in toronto and see you there bye</sample>

    <sample id="324">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="325">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="326">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance as two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning on ce task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and coal starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="327">hello everyone i'm xiaoxue a thirty year old phd student from harbin institute of technology i'm honored to present our work to you at acl twenty twenty three thank you for your interest in our work multitower aggregating the insights of unimodal experts for vision language learning multitower aggregates the insights of pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels to facilitate more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion it is important to notice that one can apply any visual texture or cross-modal encoder in multitower not only outperforms many base-sized models trained on four million data but also surpasses some models trained with small data or parameters notably multitower allows more effective exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge with well-designed managers by visualizing the average aggregation weights of textual or visual managers in each cross-modal layer over all samples in vqa dataset the x-axis is the index of the unimodal expert and the legend shows the index of the cross-modal layer this provides strong evidence that adaptive managers can adaptively exploit different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge for comprehensive cross-modal representation learning paper code and models are available on archive and github we hope our work can be useful to you thank you</sample>

    <sample id="331">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and funded by nvidia and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="332">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandes emily wu andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when translations require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these context phenomena we then use the multi-tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a

    <sample id="333">hi everyone i'm wang hao from nan university it is a great honor to be here to introduce our work in injecting curated knowledge into an mt model before introducing our work i would like to acknowledge collaborators vaijin jiang from shanghai ai lab xuanjie huang and jiachen chen from nan university and liming hong from the university of hong kong in this work we focus on neural machine translation we know that the target of mt to learn a generalized representation space to adapt to diverse scenarios however neural networks often induce a non-smooth representation space which limits its generalization ability specifically we adjust the representation by aligning contextualized representations and token embeddings to keep semantic meanings and then we align contextualized representations and token embeddings to enrich semantic meanings and we also align contextualized representations of the same target token to address the sparsely dispersing problem overall we optimize adapter with the combined learning objective and run this training loop until convergence in the end of the training loop we can drop the data store aside in our experiments we explore the following three questions the first research question is can we smooth the representation space with a small adapter and drop the data store aside during inference the second research question is how much improvement can be brought by using curated knowledge to adjust the representation distribution the third research question is will together using adapter and data store can further smooth predictions which indicates that the representation space of the mt model is not fully refined by the adapter if a more effective framework can be designed the smoothness of the representation space will be further revealed to conclude we propose a novel training framework in this paper in our framework we devise a inject and refine training loop to iteratively refine the representation space of the mt model according to curated knowledge experimental results show that ink system outperforms the state-of-the-art qmt system our ink system also achieves better translation performance with less memory space and faster inference speed besides we also find that jointly applying adapter and data store can further smooth predictions which indicates that the representation space of the mt model is not fully refined by the adapter if a more effective framework can be designed the smoothness of the representation space will be further revealed to conclude

    <sample id="335">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps first we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output after the first step we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered that's why in the second step we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="336">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models such as coders and blue are still in decade for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="339">hello i am dawei a phd student at sarland university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning approaches are proposed to robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize well beyond the original weakly labeled samples to summarize we show that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="340">hello everyone i'm guanhao huang from uca i'm presenting our work para mr a large-scale syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset by amr back-translation this is a jointed work with veron ehong anoub kaiwei and aron we propose to use amr back-translation to generate syntactically diverse paraphrases first we will use the pre-trained amr parser to get amr graph of a source sentence then we will change the focus of the graph we will randomly sample a node and set it as a new root node then modify the corresponding age and the edge able then we will use the amr graph to text generator to generate text from the modified graph for the generated text because they share the same amr graph structure so they will have similar semantics also because the generator text generator can perform better than other dataset in scs testing benchmark for the second application we consider syntactic control paraphrase generation we show that by training with para mr we can get a paraphrase generator that has better syntactic control finally we consider using paraphrase generator to generate paraphrases for data augmentation for future learning since para mr is more syntactically diverse we observe that para mr can get a higher score for future learning here is the conclusion of our work in this work we propose para mr a large-scale syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset which is constructed by amr back-translation and we show that para mr benefit several nlp applications compared to existing paraphrase dataset our dataset is available at this link thank you</sample>
    <sample id="341">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="342">hello everyone my name is gao jinjun today i'm going to present a large-scale personalized dialogue dataset left chat which is conducted by me li xinzhu from southeast university and shanghai ai here is the outline of my presentation first part is introduction with the open-domain dialogue which means a type of conventional exchange between a human and an artificial intelligence system that can cover a range of topics and doesn't have a specific goal which relies on pre-trained models and a large-scale dataset left chat can be categorized into two parts the first one is a basic profile by manual labeling and scratching the second one is a detailed profile we extract them by rules and train a personalized classifier are important to personalized extraction the second task is address recognition which shows that single stream beat outperform double stream but our personalized is beneficial to address recognition except the two tasks we also investigate the performance of the pre-trained dialogue models on left chat firstly the performance of body is better than the other two it confirms that the domain of our left chat is far from the domain of the existing dialogue dataset experimental on two benchmark tasks showed that the selected personal profiles and average sessions per person are advantageous in language speakers' personalized response the conversion between body and other lms has universality of our left chat in the future we will pay more attention to the efficient transfer of our lms for left chat my presentation is over thanks for your listening</sample>

    <sample id="346">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="347">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so for instance the word man or sorry the word warrior is usually associated with men so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group so for instance for the personas of black women we see that some of the top words are things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="348">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our method we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned language models are very good at responding to instructions and prompts so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want

    <sample id="349">hallo everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as services however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding watermark the embedding watermark contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embedding and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="350">hello everyone and welcome to the presentation of our paper entitled what's the meaning of superhuman performance in today's nlu i'm similar to this and this is a joint work with several renowned researchers spanning many institutions around the world so in the last five years leaderboard-based evaluation became the de facto standard in nlu and consequently the main objective became to reach the top spot in popular benchmarks not infrequently it happens that systems achieve human-level or even superhuman performance in such benchmarks and we call these benchmarks saturated benchmarks and these achievements quickly spread in the research community and outside however by manually inspecting these datasets we discovered several sources of error that make the comparison between humans and systems unfair the first glaring mistake is that systems and humans are evaluated on different datasets in particular humans are almost always evaluated on a small or very small subset of the actual test set for instance on boolq systems are evaluated on the full test set made of more than 3000 instances while humans are evaluated on a small subset of just 100 instances additionally we also discovered that details about the annotator pool are often omitted specifically it's often unknown how many annotators were hired following what process what is their cultural background and so on and without all this information we argue that datasets constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human to system comparisons finally along the same lines we also discovered that details about the annotator pool are often omitted specifically it's often unknown how many annotators were hired following what process what is their cultural background and so on and without all this information we argue that claims about superhuman performance are not scientifically meaningful so to summarize in this presentation we discuss the meaning of superhuman performance in nlu and explain why such claims are not yet grounded read our paper if you want to know more about the consequences of the identified issues and in our paper we also provide recommendations to avoid repeating the same mistakes and construct more reliable benchmarks thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="351">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="352">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="353">hello people from acl 2023 today i'm going to introduce the paper python code generation by asking clarification questions by housing lee mosse mascar and andrea ftm martinsch and irina gervich motivation code generation and program synthesis given natural language description is a hot research topic however state-of-the-art methods fail to address an important challenge and that challenge is input under specification in a motivating example only the classifier which is the regressor is mentioned with model specifications missing the issue is prevalent in real-world use cases and is important to train code generation models interaction for example asking clarification questions is a good paradigm to address this challenge and that goes to two hypotheses that first our task is more challenging than existing code ranking tasks which is supported by the code ranking results and we also have the hypothesis that clarifications help code generation which is supported by the code generation results we also test our pipeline we see that model performances of all error metrics including let's say with more let's say highly ranked sqs is least to a prediction close to ground truth with only minor differences however the task is challenging as the top five ranked sqs do not include sqs in the reference sqs leading to the pipeline prediction including a confusion matrix but missing the classes mentioned here so thank you for listening and please check out our paper and code and we are looking for your feedback</sample>

    <sample id="355">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them prc here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="356">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="357">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple specific constraints we apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models when properly trained on suitable datasets in summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality dataset named co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="358">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandes emily wu andrew d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus-level metrics like ble unable to capture these translations and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when translations require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in translation in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model to answer the second question we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part-of-speech tags that have high pxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high pxmi and this can be explained because english does not have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and finally we look at individual tokens that have high pxmi and this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself but that's rather expressed in the sentence structure such as ellipsis resolution to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="361">hi my name is armina norbach i'm a phd student at the language technologies institute at carnegie mellon university i'm also a research director at the jp morgan ai research team the work i'm presenting today is titled countercomp and is focused on using counterfactual scenarios to improve compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning by multi-step quantitative reasoning we're specifically focused on the question answering task so if you're given a financial table such as the one displayed on the right hand side of this slide you'd be able to ask different questions about the data in this table for instance you could ask what was the net change in revenue from 2019 to 2020 and the answer would be a certain number that's derived from executing one or more arithmetic operations and this is what we mean by multi-step quantitative reasoning we show that adding this auxiliary metric learning loss to the training procedure and that auxiliary metric learning loss has a dynamic margin that is actually measuring the extent of change or intervention in the questions between each pair and using that to adjust the metric learning loss accordingly we show that adding the auxiliary loss to three state-of-the-art baselines consistently improves their performance especially when the number of reasoning steps grows beyond two this is performance on in-distribution samples meaning the model is trained on one dataset and tested on the same dataset but more importantly we also show qualitatively that adding the countercomp loss helps the model attend to more meaningful tokens during training meaningful in the sense that they relate to more meaningful operational terms in the output here is the base main references used in this presentation for more information make sure to check out our poster or if you have any questions feel free to reach out to the contact listed here i'd like to thank my co-authors my advisor at cmu and my co-advisor at jp morgan and i would like to thank you all</sample>
