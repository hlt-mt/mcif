    <sample id="0">hi i'm jianbin phd student at the university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="1">hello everyone i'm makshatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmus task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university nila and microsoft research in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a coreference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established coreference resolution models in this figure we show the results of the best-performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-trained setting without task-specific training on kitmus both models do not perform well when trained on kitmus however both c2 and bert-coref perform significantly better than the random choice this suggests that when trained on task-specific coreference resolution datasets models learn to exploit surface cues which are not useful when testing on kitmus where such cues have been removed additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best-performing models cannot reliably integrate background knowledge presented only at inference time to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many coreference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="2">hello everyone i am jiwu from edgroup and here i'm going to be presenting our team's paper on document understanding the co-authors of this paper are all algorithm engineers from edgroup and this article is derived from our working practice in this paper we focus on the visually rich document understanding problem it aims to understand various types of documents like forms receipts and posters in recent years pre-training techniques have been introduced into this area and the self-supervised pre-training multi-modal models have demonstrated great success in various related tasks however existing document pre-training models suffer from reading order issues in this paper we propose a novel multi-modal pre-training model lesmask to address these issues lesmask only uses text and layout information as model input and aims to enhance the text layout interactions and the layout representation is learned during pre-training it differs from previous studies in three aspects choice of long deposition masking strategy and pre-training objectives in this paper we design a new pre-training objective called mask prediction during pre-training the model has to

    <sample id="3">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification or the overall level of simplification and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="4">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandes emily wu andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we started by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence and in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x and we call our tagger the multi-lingual discourse aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to

    <sample id="5">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like the alt entity corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x large model are summarized below if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="7">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our dataset and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="8">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="13">hello everybody my name is daniel rotem and i will be presenting my work finding the sweet spot analysis and improvement of adaptive inference in low resource settings which was done in professor roy schwartz's lab at the hebrew university in jerusalem adaptive inference is a method for reducing the inference time of large language models to use it we rely on the fact that real world data varies in complexity therefore we can use low capacity models for easy samples and therefore in that way reduce the average inference cost whether it be time or money the two most common adaptive inference methods are multimodal and early exit in multimodal multiple models are stored together each fit with a classifier at the end they are trained separately on the entire training set and when used for inference they are run sequentially until a classifier decides to halt that way saving the computation which would have been exhausted by the rest of the model in order to test our hypothesis we compared individual early exit models classifiers with separate multimodel classifiers which are truncated versions of the bert pre-trained language models the takeaways from our work are as follows we show the existence of conflicting gradients in early exit training process to the best of our knowledge we conduct the first fair comparison of early exit and multimodel adaptive inference methods we also introduce the sweet method the results of which motivate future research of fine-tuning algorithms tailored to the early exit architecture thank you very much for listening if you enjoyed the talk and you want to see more go visit our paper on archive finding the sweet spot</sample>
    <sample id="14">hi my name is adam sperkosky and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen treebank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination to the right this effect disappears so we showed that by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we showed in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="15">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="16">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification or the overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="17">hi everyone my name is jinchuan wu a phd student in ais i'm glad to introduce our work about multimodal relation extraction relation extraction is a widely explored task it aims to determine the semantic relation between entities in a given text however in some realistic scenarios such as in social media the data is often in various forms and modalities rather than just pure text so if you just look at the text you may find that lacks sufficient context to understand some ambiguous or multimodal words to address this issue multimodal relation extraction has been introduced recently additional visual sources are added to the textual relation extraction and then we consider taking multimodal topic information as additional semantic supplementary to enrich the overall context to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method we conduct experiments on a widely used mmr dataset we find that the information screening and compensating both contribute to the task performances and the syngraph is beneficial for structural modeling of the multimodal inputs when removing the syngraph the performances get decreased next we want to know under what circumstance do the internal information screening and external information exploiting help so we group the instances by text relevance relevance scores and make the predictions for different groups for the inputs with higher text relevance relevance the gene plays a greater role than namo indicating that the performances screening plays a more important role because most of the high cross-modal relevance input features comes with rich yet even redundant information where the internal information screening is needed for the noising for the inputs with lower text relevance namo contributes more significantly than gene that means the external information exploiting is more useful in conclusion we introduce a novel idea of simultaneous information subtraction and addition for multimodal relation extraction we perform internal information screening with the guidance of the graph information bot-like principle we devise a latent multimodal topic model and induce latent multimodal topic features to enrich the feature context our overall system achieves significant improvements over the existing best models on the benchmark so thanks a lot if you are interested in our work you can scan the qr code for more detailed information thank you</sample>

    <sample id="19">hello everyone my name is chancellor a master's student from shenzhen university i'm so glad that our work or survey for efficient open domain question answering was accepted by sdl 2023 it's my great honor to present our work i will introduce our work following the four five parts our work focuses on open domain question answering a mainstream framework is the two-stage model proposed by danqi chen in 2017 the first stage uses a retrieval to retrieve several evidences context from a wikipedia corpus and the second stage uses a reader to understand the question and retrieve the evidences to reason out the answers the third aspect is how to reduce the model size or to achieve this goal you can select light weight models or parameter sharing or designing one stage model for both retrieval and reading if it pursues real-time feedback retrieve only systems to be good choices if one pursues treat of retrieval and reader systems are relatively more appropriate finally we discuss two future works the first one is how can the open domain question answering systems be deployed in low power devices and the second one is more evaluation metrics should be considered that is all my presentations thank you for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="20">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 4 gigabytes of set of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of set of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of set of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which port public and private non-domain tasks such as name entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to 6 baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes common bert and common bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on common bert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 non-domain tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="21">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="22">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="23">hi i'm dan garrett and i'm going to talk about our work on improving the ability for text to image models to render visual text uh text to image modeling research has made huge strides in the last year with the ability to generate very high quality interesting images but a lot of people have noticed that these models are often very bad at representing text uh we specifically look at the imagine model uh which works by taking the input text encoding it with a t5 xl encoder and then using that encoded text representation as input to a diffusion model which is actually able to generate the image here we can see a fairly complex input uh producing an accurate uh image output however even a much simpler text input that requires the image to contain a word will often fail to understand what's going on here we can dig into the text encoder itself t5 uh uses sentence piece tokenization which means that instead of the model receiving the individual letters that make up the spelling of the input um it's receiving subword ids uh for chunks of the input string that means if it's asked to uh render the a word it has to be able to learn how to copy the input characters to the output and so this improved um image generation uh uh characteristics um and as well as the ability for it to render text it's not perfect at rendering text though because the diffusion model actually can uh introduce errors so even though the text encoder itself knows the spelling the generation might um contain mistakes so the main takeaways from our paper are the wiki spell benchmark for text only models the draw text benchmark for text to um image models and a new efficient strategy for improving model spelling ability which is to um uh uh concatenate in uh a model that's actually aware of the the characters in the input</sample>

    <sample id="26">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected thus far we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="27">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="29">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multilingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emilio uh andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context and for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus-level metrics like blue unable to capture these translations and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in translation in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model to answer the second question we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part-of-speech tags that have high pxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high pxmi and this can be explained because english does not have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="30">hello everyone we are going to introduce our paper blender which is a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework for large language models and this key idea is based on pairwise ranking and generative fusion so there are so many large language models released every week and many of them claim that they have achieved a great performance um and from this blender we can it did say oh some models are better than the others but this is only about average overall performance and when you have a particular input x we can select and generate a better output than using any single model for our input x and given the comparison matrix here we can derive a matrix here and where each element in this matrix represents the comparison logic for candidate i being better than candidate j then from this matrix we can have three methods to aggregate all these results and we found that using the mean average is the best solution but if you worry about the efficiency you can also use bubble sort algorithm here and we can also get a decent performance so experiments here show that pairwise ranking is much better correlated with oracle ranking better than all the other ranking methods on various correlation metrics so to evaluate to enable the evaluation of ensemble learning framework for large language models we also create a new data set named mix instruct so it consists of existing instruction data sets and we collect the candidates from 11 open source legendary models here and this result suggests that blender is a very promising framework for ensemble learning although it's very simple and straightforward so in the end we want to give some take home messages here so blender is a simple and effective ensemble learning framework for large language models it has two sub-modules pairwise ranking is a pairwise first module that we can get the matrix for all these results and jump user can take the top three candidates and generate the final output and it largely improved the performance and mix instruct is our data set for evaluating the black box models here and we also release a unified data code base and our data for evaluation and future research okay so that's all thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="31">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john bauer miller kanishka misra garen flowers roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="34">hello everyone my name is marcos treviso and today i'm going to present a work called crest a joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual text generation crest is a result of a great collaboration with alexis ross luno geheru and dr martins so let's say we have an input like this one for which the classifier predicts a particular decision there are many methods for interpreting this decision one class of methods uses selective rationalization which provides explanations by highlighting tokens in a faithful way another method which is more close aligned with the human cause of reasoning is to generate counterfactuals by editing specific parts of the input and in this work we propose to combine these methods to leverage their complementary strengths the result is crest a joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual generation that produces valid fluent and diverse counterfactuals in a controllable way and that by leveraging these counterfactuals during training it leads to plausible explanations that focus on the contrasted parts of the input take a look at our paper and our code for more information thank you</sample>
    <sample id="36">hi welcome to acl 2022 this is a sneak peek into learning language specific layers for multilingual machine translation joint work with robin schmidt yushi liao and stefan bitez multilingual machine translation has several advantages namely scalability as it's easier to train and maintain a single model rather than one model per language direction speed because you can directly translate between any two languages instead of having to pivot through a third language like english and this also leads to lesser cascade finally you get improvements for low resource language pairs on the other hand it also means a larger model size so if you do that you're going to get an architecture like the one we show here where the bottom two layers are shared the next two

    <sample id="37">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes and stereotypical narratives in our work we aim to address these limitations by using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes and essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="42">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="45">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups furthermore most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="46">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multilingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emilio uh andrew f d martins and gram new big so a lot of translations depend on context in translation and this is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in translation in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model in this work we extend cxmi to pointwise cxmi and this helps us identify cases like the one here where in chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="47">hi i'm jianbin phd student at the university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electronic electric chollet problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="49">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so this is a joint work with john bauer michael muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="50">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification also overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="51">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="53">in this video i would like to present our recent work on weakly supervised learning a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning approaches to address this problem setting but this implies that additional manual annotations are required in wsl approaches to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help wsl approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and the practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="54">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with a uc of 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="55">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is our solution first two use already existing offline models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simultaneous speech translation use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is the sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted while since the sum of the cross-attention is above the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="56">hello everyone my name is xin jian from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models such as coders and blue are still indecisive for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="59">hi i'm yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natschos a second version of 4 gigabytes of natschos a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english bert model trained on the 4 gigabytes of natschos show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on camanber weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here camanber we also observe that specialize data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natschos are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="62">hello my name is natalia calderon and i'm the main author of this acl paper a systematic study of knowledge distillation for natural language generation this is a pseudotarget training and this is a fantastic collaboration with amir and the super four me at microsoft and my phd advisor ruy so as we all know natural language generation systems or energy systems are based on large language models and they become larger more complex and much more slow which can also come with great financial cost as a result there is a growing demand in the industry for compressing these models and the main problem is that while you want to compress your large model you also want to preserve its performance and this is exactly the goal of this paper we want to explore the potential of energy distillation or in other words the finding the recipe for distillation we then move to the main contribution of this paper which explores the extensions of the usage of pseudotargets state-of-the-art baselines you can call them then we move to the joint teaching applies world level distillation on pseudotargets generated by both the teacher and the student and for more details

    <sample id="66">hello everyone we are glad to share our study paper deep learning for mathematical reasoning mathematical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence that enables us to comprehend and make decisions based on numeric data and language the development of machines capable of solving math problems and proving theorems has been a long-standing focus of ai and elp in recent years there has been a surge of interest in this area so our study discusses the task of mathematical reasoning and the development of a deep learning method for it in the last few years we have witnessed the remarkable development of pre-trained language models such as large language models llms these language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide range of elp tasks we can also apply llms to solve math problems by guiding them to produce a sequence of steps before giving the final answer despite the advantages llms still face inherent limitations one notable example is the lack of ability to perform precise mathematical reasoning in addition to designing effective prompting methods for llms a novel line of work is to design the true augmented llms for example program-aided llms are very helpful in complex mathematical reasoning tasks given different input queries cameleon arises in the proposed approach can generate natural language programs to compose different tools for use despite the creation of various datasets mathematical reasoning in low-resource settings remains underexplored recently there has been attempts to build non-english datasets for chinese korean and arabic additionally pioneering research has developed mathematical reasoning benchmarks for financial scientific and medical domains despite the impressive progress deep learning models commonly display generalization and robustness failures on reasoning tasks first llms struggle with large numbers second large language models are inconsistent with mathematical reasoning with that thank you so much for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="67">hi i'm uri and today i want to talk to you about interference in multilingual translation models these models can benefit from synergy between different language pairs or suffer from interference for example training to translate english to finnish may improve the quality of english-estonian while english-to-chinese may not so we conclude that language similarity is not a dominant factor for interference now we experiment across model and focus data sizes when varying the total number of interfering languages and these are the results the x-axis is the average interference for the low-resource language pairs and y is for the high-resource ones temperature values from 1 to 5 are on the markers based on this we can say that a baseline for battling interference is weak due to size in the small models and weak due to uncalibrated temperature for larger ones that use values that are too high the lesson here is that tune temperature is key for strong performance to conclude we find that model and data size affect the levels of interference in multilingual translation while other factors like language similarity affect much less and that modest scale and tune temperature can reduce the problem significantly without any other specialized method thank you</sample>
    <sample id="68">hi everyone i'm koushik mishra and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gaultier aaron muller tanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="69">in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning this is a joint work with xiaoyu shen marios moussakas and giorgos stefanidis in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data then the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well this implies that weakly supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weakly supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ft w performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent weakly supervised learning approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly and the performance gain and the practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second weakly supervised learning approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="70">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so when people are describing a woman they'll usually actually specify woman and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance um there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure um on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening um have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="84">hello everyone i'm shah here today i'm going to talk about my paper in iclr 2023 partnered dynamic networks first of all i want to talk about the background knowledge about dynamic networks and we can see that most of the traditional networks are static networks based on the input value the network computes it with the fixed or static parameters and the static parameters is that have massive less effect on the those values for example if we transform a parameter into a static one and we cannot see a big change in the loss value we can see this this parameter is unimportant and can safely transform it to a static one and we also compare our methods with network pruning and from our performance is much uh is significantly uh better because we maintain the static parameters and we also found partnered can make the output more discriminating which contributes to the uh better performance compared to uh the static networks and we think this uh some uh future works deserve to be explored such as explore expand our method to other mechanism networks also try to extend our method to some hardware from the structure manner and and and last but not least uh further introduce more modes such as the combination of non-zero elements static parameters and dynamic parameters uh that's all for our</sample>

    <sample id="89">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo nigro and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architectures for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where the attention points to and what is emitted if the attention is above a certain threshold alpha and we also see that if we look at the main results of the dot we plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted over the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that dot is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="90">hello i'm hannah lee one of the authors of rethinking annotation can language learners contribute as language models advance data annotation gets essential in nlp it has been customary to recruit native speakers for data annotation and word meaning questions asking about the meaning of the words to check their language proficiency and language learners' capabilities of nlp data annotation by showing training simulations with learners' annotations language models trained on learners' less accurate labels achieved about 95 of ground truth performance and sometimes outperformed the model trained with native speakers' labels in conclusion this paper questions the necessity of recruiting native speakers for data annotation and shows that language learners could definitely contribute to nlp annotations we believe this work showed the possibility of broadening nlp research for many languages jumping over geographic and technological barriers to building benchmark data sets for low-resource languages where it is hard to recruit native speakers thank you for listening please refer to our paper for more details such as how control variables affect annotation performances any questions are welcome via the email below</sample>

    <sample id="94">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the embedding as service watermark contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="97">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo d'alessandro and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated and that is the threshold alpha uh we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda speech frames that is lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="98">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so last but not least we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection to nlp applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications so we see that if we were to sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="99">hi i'm si jian from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with no consideration of specific goals with our method we adopt the idea of over-generated script to improve generation quality in total we generate 55000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of generated specific goals with co-script we can trace smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we found that tiffany and tune on co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable data sets in summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluated the constraint language planning ability of large language models and developed a over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-scripted dataset can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="100">hello multi-hop qa is about answering questions that require multiple reasoning jumps to answer for example to answer this question what 1988 christmas comedy film did brian doyle murray star in we first need to find all the movies that uh that that brian doyle murray star in and find uh the movie that was released in 1988 we're going to be referring to uh this set of documents required to answer a question as the chain multi-hop retrieval retrievers are trained by maximizing probability of the ground truth chain given questions so for instance training examples q1 c1 q2 c2 etc where q is a question and c is a chain prompt uh retrievers are trained by maximizing the probability of the question given the chain prompt uh let's go through a working example leaving this question and this chain what we do is we have a prompt that looks like this where we need to insert the chain documents into the prompt and we have an indicator token to designate uh that this is a document and we have uh an instruction which uh in our case here is something like read the previous documents and ask a question and the instruction serves to elicit the language model reasoning abilities over the chain documents with that i conclude my talk and thank you so much for listening</sample>

    <sample id="103">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emilio uh andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context and for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus-level metrics like blue unable to capture these translations and some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in translation in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model we then use cxmi to look for patterns between these words and we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part-of-speech tags that have high pxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high pxmi and this can be explained because english does not have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="107">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual few-shot transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="108">hi everyone i'm koushik mishra and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem we see a massive increase in acceptability judgments in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see a similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to the latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="112">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="114">hi everyone uh i'm going to introduce our work on acl 2023 called finding the pillars of strengths for multi-head attention so we are from nanyang technological university of singapore to begin with as we all know the large language models are game-changing from the task-specific models for each field of natural language processing now the large language models can learn all tasks in one model and this is revolutionary however several limitations are identified for example the heavy parameters they usually contain billions of parameters which is not deployable on small clusters they usually require long training time for example the lama 65 takes one million gpu hours with our even with our best gpus and they are talking hungry they require a huge corpus for example the lama 65 is trained on a four point four five terabyte corpus today we are going to focus on the heavy parameter problem of the multi-head attention so as we all know the multi-head attention is designed to attend to different subspaces of the input and each head attends to a unique but different input subspace but as we all know that we only remain one head for each group and achieve significant parameter compression in extreme conditions we can compress 90 of parameters 622 factor inference speed and 80 flop against the model which yields the same performance on the same dataset in the future we identify that the task-specific automatic pruning is very promising direction so given the lottery ticket hypothesis uh we know that the networks contain subnetworks that reach task accuracy comparable to the to the original network which means that we believe that we can prune the networks without sacrificing the performance as we as we uninstall the apps on our iphone and if imagine that if we don't uninstall the unused apps on our iphone they will be too heavy to use so this is all for today's video if you want to know more about our work please do not hesitate to attend to our poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="115">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo daniele and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="116">in the sentence john saw the newly elected president on tv pre-trained parameters can contain information about what presidents do and what a tv is but they cannot reliably know who this instance-specific entity john is or who the new president is because the president might have changed since pre-training therefore successful models for knowledge-intensive nlu tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-trained time and inference time knowledge in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models in the background pre-trained setting we assume that the background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre-trained parameters in the inference time context we provide the entity-specific knowledge chichester is a politician in the background both setting we additionally provide not only entity-specific knowledge but also background knowledge about politicians in the inference time context if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="117">the most important factor is the quality of the source sentence so it's important to select the examples from high-quality translations in particular we compare selecting prompts from the training data of the wmt evaluations or the dev data the dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data so in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gain from the human evaluation that we perform using the mqm framework is that the fluency of parm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy so in particular the most common error are omission errors so it seems that parm chooses to produce a better-sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in the translation however the style awkward category for parm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that parm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="118">hello everyone we'll be presenting our acl 2023 submission which is the improving pre-training techniques for code-switched nlp so first we define what code-switching is so here we have an example laptop mira bag mira key this is a code-mixed sentence of english and hindi so some of the words are english and some of the words are hindi so this is a pretty common occurrence in linguistically diverse communities like india so building computational models for code-switching is very important but in this case multilingual pre-trained models like embert and xlm don't perform that well on code-switching tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis so our main contributions in this work are we propose novel mlm techniques which are tuned to the case of code-switching and we motivate architectural changes and add an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information in the final representation so in summary we propose a new mlm objective which is tuned to handle code-switched information we hypothesize and verify using probing classifiers that our methods increase the amount of switch point information present in the intermediate layers and with this result in mind we motivate some architectural changes and add an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information content thank you</sample>
    <sample id="119">hi i'm jian wen phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political biases of language models on the two different temporal corpora we can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017 so this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models for example if a right-leaning language models were to be fine-tuned on unhate speech or misinformation and whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control so this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political biases so a little bit of discussion we would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases it's like between scylla and charybdis so if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric challie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="121">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our dataset if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the entity accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="123">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="124">hi everyone this is tan jie yi from the national university of singapore and ali baba i'm glad to share our work towards benchmarking and improving the temporal reasoning capability of lms time is a fundamental axis in the real world we first break down temporal reasoning into three different levels the first level is time to time reasoning such as what is the year after 2010 answering this question will only meet the understanding of the time axis the second level is time to event reasoning in this work we include long duration facts as event as well an example question is what team did leo messi play for in 2020 time period which could be correlated to the term frequencies in the pre-training quadrant we can see that chatgpt is close to solving the year prediction problem but later we do find that its performance drops significantly when performing month prediction besides its performance on l2 and l3 reasoning is also not promising even losing to the significantly smaller flat t5l in l2 reasoning in conclusion we analyze and expose the temporal reasoning biases of lms we also propose the temp reasoning benchmark dataset that covers all three temporal reasoning types and comprehensive time periods last but not least we propose a training paradigm to improve lms temporal reasoning and that will be all for my presentation thank you all for your time</sample>

    <sample id="126">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the pennsylvania state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoders and decoders and we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="127">hi thanks for tuning in i'm nam ghuo a master's student at keist ai in korea i'd like to introduce our work large language models as reasoning teachers to transfer their reasoning abilities to much smaller models we propose a novel technique called diverse reasoning if you see here we don't only generate one reasoning sample from the teacher we generate many of them using stochastic temperature sampling and since these are very complex questions all of these solutions have slightly distinct solutions and that is why these samples can be used to train the student even better and we found that students under fine-tuned this method that we call fine-tuned cot can perform a complex reasoning task quite well now there's a lot of analysis and discussion that is in the paper but we don't have time for that so you can check the paper for more details so the basic takeaways is that simple distillation can transfer the reasoning abilities from very large teachers to small students smaller than 1 billion parameters and this may be possible for other emergent abilities in the future our method with diverse reasoning is accessible and it's a very effective approach and it's also very highly scalable and this kind of distillation poses various trade-offs between development costs and inference costs as well as the quality of the inference so that is it for the video please check out our paper that goes through a bunch of details over 40 pages including how reasoning emerges in small models as well as results on open source models we provide the code and data from all of our experiments even the smaller ones including a thousand dollars or more worth of teacher inference from open ai for your pleasure we encourage you to take our material for future work also feel free to reach out for discussions thank you for listening and hope to see you at the conference</sample>
    <sample id="128">hello everyone i'm makshatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmos task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university mila and microsoft research kitmos is a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration from multiple sources we have defined three settings of kitmos first we have the background pre-trained setting where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pre-training time second there is the background both setting where background knowledge is available both at pre-training time and at inference time lastly the background inference setting where background knowledge is available only at inference time to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="129">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so for instance the word man or sorry the word warrior is usually associated with men so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group so for instance for the personas of black women we see that some of the top words are things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="130">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="131">in this video i would like to present our recent work on weakly supervised learning a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well this implies that weakly supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weakly supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex weakly supervised learning methods which require more computation time and disk space our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second weakly supervised learning approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in weakly supervised learning finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="133">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks therefore this motivates us to build a multi-modal instruction tuning data set here we present multi-instruction the first multi-modal pre-trained model as a base model uh during training we mix all the instances for all the tasks uh each instance is randomly combined with one of the five instructions as we can see uh using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot uh so we also did one experiment uh we use one instruction versus five instruction as we can see uh using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits uh we design a new metric called sensitivity uh so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning data set with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so uh this is a qr code for our uh data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="135">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale these approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality but dialogue quality has many aspects therefore you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of dialogue quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or likert scale methods however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="136">hello everybody so my name is shazavan and today i'll be presenting the work that i conducted with my supervisor nefisa at the university of sheffield so the title of the paper is format an alternative to accuracy for numerical reasoning and what we do in the paper is we perform a baseline evaluation and we find that actually most models tend to perform quite poorly across all these aspects that we've introduced going back to training dependency what we really look at is we look at these five classes at the bottom and let's just focus on the first one the exact so we look at whether if a testing i need three plus seven have i seen have i had a question that needs needed three plus seven at training time and have has seeing that at training time made the um the model perform better and what we see that even when the exact expression is seen the accuracy still below 50 so the model doesn't necessarily memorize these things um and what we believe is that maybe a training maybe the word increase is was present to suggest addition where there's a testing the word another might be used um so that linguistic notation is quite important a last investigation that we perform is looking at the impact of training templates so what we have is we've got four um graphs zero shot which is the black one in the middle um base which is 200000 questions which is the one used to train the to fine tune the models base diversified which uses extra template from jsmak and aqua which is a green graph on the outskirt and this shows that having this kind of language diversity from jsmak and aqua and also mathematical diversity as they combine different um operations as well shows that this is a lot more promising in improving um the performance so in terms of conclusions we find that the existing benchmarks tend to be unrepresentative and single scores don't help with that and this is why fairmat is there to provide a more alternative evaluation to fill in that gap we find that language and mathematical diversity is important and also that um with other analyses find that number encoding and tokenization are areas of improvement so again you've got the qr code and the links um thank you very much for listening and i do encourage you to read the paper</sample>
    <sample id="137">hi i'm sisun from the singapore university of technology and design i will share our work named tell to design a dataset for language guided floor plan generation published in acm tog 2023 recently test-conditional generative ai models have demonstrated impressive results in generating high-fidelity images such models generally focus on understanding high-level visual concepts from sentence-level descriptions and the generated images are valid for looking realistic and being creative thereby being more suitable for generating artwork like images the main challenges of this novel task are threefold the first challenge is to perform the design generation under much stricter constraints compared with artwork-like text-conditional image generation and the second challenge is to understand the big picture of the entire floor plan from document-level unstructured text with fuzzy and entangled information and the third challenge comes from the ambiguous incomplete or misleading information in human instructions nevertheless when artificial instructions are used for warming up before training on human instructions the performance of our method is significantly improved with over 10 io scores increment this suggests that despite the language gap artificial and human instructions are mutually beneficial data portions during training here we provide a case study of different baseline generations conditioned on the same human instructions we can see that although several text-conditional image generation models can produce realistic floor plan images they all fail to align well with the requirements specified in the human instructions to conclude we initiate the research of a novel language-guided design generation task with a specific focus on the floor plan domain as a start and we introduce tell to design a large-scale dataset that features floor plans with neutral language instructions to describe user preferences and we then propose a sequence-to-sequence model as a strong baseline and compare it with several text-conditional image generation models we hope this paper will serve as a foundation and propel further research on the task of language-guided design generation and that's all thanks for the listening</sample>

    <sample id="141">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these context phenomena we then use the multi tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="142">hi i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context the first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain the second one which is the alternative question is generated as follows we always use a simple template do you mean a or b where a and b are samples from wikipedia for the recipes and books domain we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia so the annotators know how they look like if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators then the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 but this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="143">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo d'alessandro and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated and that is the threshold alpha uh we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda speech frames that is lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="144">the authors of the article are yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 4 gigabytes of natchez and a final version of dr bert with a mix of 4 gigabytes of natchez and 4 gigabytes of clinical notes in addition to this comparison we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weight and tokenizer of dr bert trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez another also based on dr bert but trained this time on the 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which are public and private down-stream tasks such as named entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to 6 baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes common bert common bert 4 gigabytes common bert and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those uh on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from uh we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total we have 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that specialize data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="146">hi everyone i'm jie chen a phd student from fudan university now i will give you a talk about our paper on the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization first i'm going to briefly introduce the background of dialogue summarization dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization it is the process of creating a concise summary that represents the most important information within a dialogue there are many scenarios in dialogue summarization how to extract the key information of dialogues in different domains is valuable and worth exploring recent years we have achieved great progress in dialogue summarization especially using large-scale pre-trained language models which can generate fluent and coherent summaries however the generated summaries still have the omission problem which means the generated summaries have the missing content in the generated summaries which are presented in the gold reference in this task we mainly focus on the utterance level omission and the detection model needs to predict which utterances of dialogues are omitted in the generated summaries to ensure the quality of labels we also perform human evaluation to assess the quality of the generated summaries another question is what happens if we use the omissions to refine the summary we use a post-editing method for some refinement the method is straightforward we concatenate the candidate summary with the omission content as input and the model outputs the refined summary in a sequence-to-sequence manner from the figure we find that the label imbalance problem exists in the dataset for the results in the table you can find that the f one score is around fifty percent this performance indicates that the task is very challenging which calls for more advanced detection models that's all for the introduction if there is any question please contact me thank you</sample>
    <sample id="147">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first generate personas using prompts like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this

    <sample id="148">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and funded by nuno kaesler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo daniele and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right and we compare with popular strategies that are also applied to offline models since their curves are shifted over the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational wall time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="149">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="150">hello everyone i'm archikey and i'll be presenting our acl paper meeting qa extractive question answering on meeting transcripts we address this gap by introducing a new dataset called meeting qa which is an extractive question answering dataset based on questions asked by participants in a meeting and the corresponding answer sentences here is an example from meeting qa with the question shown in red and the answers are highlighted in blue as seen in the figure questions asked by participants are longer open-ended and actively seek discussions from others we also have interesting answer scenarios such as multiple speakers contributing to the answer span as well as rhetorical questions here is a brief overview of our data collection process we begin with public meeting transcripts from the ami corpus which corresponds to nearly 100 hours of manually transcribed multi-party meetings we perform question selection based on punctuation and filtering out really short questions to annotate answers we recruit annotators to label sentences in the answer span we obtain a high inter-annotator agreement reflected by a krippendorff's alpha of 073 in total meeting qa contains 77000 questions split between the train dev and test set as shown in the table 30 of our questions are unanswerable out of the remaining 40 have multi-span answers and 48 have multi-speaker answers here is a distribution of question types a majority of our questions are framed in a yes-no manner and still elicit detailed responses as well as our opinion-seeking lastly we show the length distribution of meeting transcripts questions and answers in meeting qa to summarize meeting qa is an interesting dataset based on open-ended and discussion-seeking questions in real-life meeting scenarios and the dataset is far from being solved as it is challenging for existing qa models in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings thank you so much for listening and you can find more details on our project page or in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="151">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="152">hello everyone my name is frederik riemenschneider and i'm here to talk about our work at the fascinating intersection of nlp and classical philology in this presentation titled exploring large language models for classical philology we will introduce valuable resources for ancient greek and latin moreover we will explore the implications and challenges of multilinguality in these models before we dive in let's take a quick look at the current landscape of language models in classics there have been several models recently developed latin bird was introduced in 2020 then came ancient greek bird in 2021 and another ancient greek bird was released just last year in 2022 so with these advancements it might seem like we're done right well of course not first of all all these models are bird models which means that they are a specific type of encoder-only models moreover these models are all monolingual yet it seems realistic that scholars might want to utilize a model that is proficient in both ancient greek and latin and for english as well so in essence we have varied our models along two dimensions language and architecture the first step in building these models is to gather pre-training data for ancient greek previous models have relied on open greek and latin which we naturally also use but in addition we leveraged previously unused resources and to go a step further we have developed a new pre-training corpus from the internet archive the internet archive contains numerous book scans with ocr transcriptions however as we can see in this example the greek text appears as unreadable rubbish because the ocr did not allow greek characters unfortunately most texts have not been ocr'd with settings allowing greek characters and are not tagged as containing greek texts with this approach our models have elevated lemmatization performance by an impressive five percentage points above the existing state of the art for ancient greek we can also see performance gains for latin lemmatization we also probe our models for their semantic and world knowledge capabilities does our multilingual model perform better because it can learn from three languages results have shown that our models significantly outperform previous models however there doesn't seem to be a significant difference between the performances of the multilingual and the monolingual models this is the case both for semantic knowledge as well as world knowledge to conclude we have introduced new powerful language models for classical philology that are initialized from scratch and use a native tokenizer we pre-trained both encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures as well as multilingual models so latin and greek texts can be processed by the same model additionally we have introduced a high-quality pre-training dataset for ancient greek we have rigorously benchmarked previous and our own models we have analyzed how t5's encoder behaves and we have investigated the implications of multilinguality in our language models this video provides only a brief overview of what we did for more details check out our paper thank you for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="160">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="161">there are 55000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and the test sites we asked crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we found that the generated specific goals with co-script we can choose smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we found that tifafuntune on co-script can generate scripts of high quality than most of large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable data sets in summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use a large language models to generate a high quality script dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-scripted dataset can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="163">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="164">in this video i would like to present our recent work on weakly supervised learning a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well this implies that weakly supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weakly supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent weakly supervised learning approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly and the performance gain and the practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done where clean validation samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="165">hello everyone i'm excited to be here to present our recent paper titled adaptive common sense reasoning exploiting mutually exclusive explanations my name is wen ting zhao and i'm a phd student at cornell university before diving into our approach to adaptive reasoning i will first provide a concrete example to help illustrate what it means followed by a more formal definition and our recent approach to adaptive reasoning predominantly relies on supervised methods however these methods necessitate the annotation of plausible explanations which can be noisy and subjective a recent experiment revealed that crowd workers disagree on sixty percent over a thousand explanations therefore we also need an additional regularizer to achieve this to build the regularizer we depend on a significant characteristic of explanations which is their mutual exclusivity here is a brief overview of our results on alpha nli the most widely used adaptive reasoning dataset we compare it to a number of zero-shot models and the previous best unsupervised approach lipo outperforms all of them including a strong zero-shot gpt-3 baseline by over four absolute point in accuracy and this concludes my talk thank you for listening our paper can be found at tinyurlcom slash jal-lipoor</sample>

    <sample id="168">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conll 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="174">hi i'm priya and i'm one of the co-authors of the paper arg analysis 35k a large scale data set for argument quality analysis in this video i'm going to quickly explain why this data set is unique from other data sets that you will find on a similar topic this is just going to be a quick like overview of the special features that we have so do make sure to check out our paper and our poster at the conference for better insight into the results data set collection process data set annotation process etcetera so very quickly what is argument analysis it's simply judging how good or bad an argument is on a scale of zero to one so something like big banks are bad is likely to be rated low but something like big banks have no accountability take heavy risks and lead to major collapses which is why they should be broken up which is a coherent argument which is more persuasive in terms of what it's trying to achieve it's going to be rated high and this just creates a better diversity in terms of the motions that you will encounter in a parliamentary debate setting rather than just pre-selecting a few motions and like for each theme and just better captures has more arguments and better captures like the relevance that each argument has to a topic right so we think that this data set is just a culmination of like a bunch of unique things and at the end of it you are able to get something that is more diverse that has a score for relevance so you are able to capture how relevant it is to a particular theme you have higher quality of arguments and in general you just have a more reliable scoring because we capture it on instance based level so do make sure to like check out our paper and like give us your feedback on it thanks</sample>
    <sample id="175">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="176">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="177">the name of the speaker is yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first biomedical model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 4 gigabytes of natchez and a final version of dr bert with a mix of 4 gigabytes of natchez and 4 gigabytes of clinical notes in addition to this comparison we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weight and tokenizer of dr bert trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez another also based on dr bert but trained this time on the 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which are public and private down-stream tasks such as name entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to 6 baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes of natchez oscar 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those uh on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from uh we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total we have 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="178">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="179">hi everyone i'm melanie sklar and i'll talk about mining language models lack of theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models we present symbolic tom an inference time method to improve theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models using explicit graphical representations symbolic tom uses several graphical representations since mental states cannot be represented with a single graph for example on the left we see a representation of what bob believes is the current world state and on the right we see a representation of what bob thinks that alice believes is the current world state we call these graphs b-bob and a-alice in general performance results for second order false belief questions and all others can be found in the paper for testing our method generalization capabilities we designed two new data sets both modifying the tommi benchmark we test for story structure generalization by for example concatenating two stories and asking half the time about the first story and half the time about the second one this is the d1 data set and we designed two more d2 and d3 we also test for linguistic generalization which is our second data set called paraphrase tommi generating a data set that has more linguistic diversity this is important since tommi is generated automatically with only one way of phrasing each sentence for the story structure generalization data sets we observe that supervised models heavily degrade the performance on the three data sets we created for example showing around 50 performance in the data set d1 that i just described on the other hand using symbolic tom still shows significant gains for all models allowing stronger models like gpt-4 to fully solve the data sets giving for example a 42 point accuracy boost for data set d1 so in conclusion we introduced symbolic tom a plug-and-play method to improve theory of mind reasoning skills in large language models it is an inference time algorithm which avoids overfitting risk it uses explicit graphical symbolic representation which yields more interpretable reasoning and symbolic tom dramatically improves out-of-the-box llm performance outperforming supervised approaches on out-of-domain story understanding and remaining beneficial on the new linguistic diversity data set paraphrase tommi for more details please refer to the paper and don't hesitate to reach out to chat thank you so much for listening</sample>
    <sample id="180">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so for instance for the personas of black women we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human written ones however when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon we find very different things so while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="182">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our method we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned lls are very good at responding to instructions and prompts so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this

    <sample id="184">so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle context dependent translations is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context and this makes corpus level metrics like bleu unable to capture these translations and similarly we find that context is supported to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use corpus level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context aware models perform best and if we use wordf measure then models with and without context have comparable performance this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use corpus level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="185">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare 4 from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english bert model trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on common bear weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here common bear we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="187">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models thank you</sample>
    <sample id="188">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ail strategy for rare class acquisition and coal starting ail with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="189">hi i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example the one without words not the one with the 12 year old and 12 year old boy or the fictional one or comes from other worlds and so on the ltd corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x large model are summarized below if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the ltd accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="190">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5-based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="191">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo daniele and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we'll plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="195">hello everyone today i will introduce our work reasoning over hierarchical question decomposition tree for explainable question answering explainable question answering aims to answer a given question and provide an explanation why the answer is selected recent work in xqa can be grouped into two directions neuro-symbolic methods which translate natural language questions into formal representations such as sparql and decomposition-based methods which generate natural language intermediate questions based on the grouped leaf questions according to their reference tokens besides we also compute a certainty score of each node based on the likelihood to represent the certainty of its generation after building the hqdt we can solve the complex question we are conducting probabilistic reasoning over the hqdt the reasoning process is from the root to leaves in a recursive way and contains three steps for each node firstly a scheduler will determine the appropriate knowledge sources for this node the sources include a kb a text corpus or solving its children recursively and sequentially secondly the corresponding executors will get the answers with probabilities from the selected knowledge sources and the aggregator will aggregate the candidate answers from all the knowledge sources and output top k answers with the highest probabilities demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing knowledge from kb and text together our ohd text model improves f1 by 119 compared with sota method exsa with both text and kb the performance of our ohd mix is also remarkably better than transporter net comparing our ohd text and our ohd mix we can also see some benefits of supplementing the text information with knowledge from kb that's all thanks for your listening</sample>
    <sample id="196">hi my name is adam sperberkovsky and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about the bees so the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from read to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from read to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the penn tree bank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and also the observation that was made in passing that uh this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect disappears so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we show in the paper how this uh provides an argument against um asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="197">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="198">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron miller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context like whether the context is coming from a different uh subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current uh like to the sentence that we are looking at so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding uh like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model uh like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="199">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets and only gains in three datasets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="200">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="201">the insights that we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of parm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but parm comes pretty close to a commercial system in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of parm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy in particular the most common errors are omission errors so it seems that parm chooses to produce a better-sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style awkward category for parm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that parm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="202">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conll 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="205">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="206">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected thus far we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="207">the recent set of tests used to evaluate the capabilities of large language models for translation include the wmt evaluations or the dev data the dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data that is more normalized and the results show better performance when using the dev data the insights that we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy in particular the most common errors are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better-sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style awkward category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="208">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first generate personas using prompts like imagine

    <sample id="209">our method greatly improves the plannability in terms of semantic completeness and faithfulness to the constraint since large language models are costly to deploy it is essential to enable language planning ability of smaller and specialized models creating dataset is an essential step to our end however previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals and manual data annotation is expensive thus we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning dataset from large language models we apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate 55000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script shows high polysemy in the generated specific goals with co-script we can train smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we found that co-script data set can generate scripts of higher quality than most of large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable datasets in summary a way established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="210">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="211">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="212">in this paper we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models since no dataset of specific goals exists to support our study we create a dataset of constrained language planning named as codescript in total we generate 55000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constrained distribution of codescript we find that codescript shows high polysemy in the generated specific goals with codescript we can choose smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we find that fine-tuned on codescript can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable datasets in summary we establish the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop an over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset codescript for constrained language planning we hope codescript dataset can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of codescript in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="213">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks we use all the instances in the test split for each task we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions as we can see using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot so overall we propose the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset which significantly improves the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="215">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts uh grows the tendency disappears and we show that by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="217">hello everyone i'm getting to introduce our work here seen to unseen exploring compositional generation for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation and we're hosting and working with lulu zhao from beijing university of posts and telecommunications now i'll talk about our works in following seven aspects i will introduce our motivations first previous methods for generation generating controllable dialogue focus on single attributes ignoring the practical setting of multiple attribute combinations methods for multiple attribute text generation that learn from single attribute prompts that use attribute related information from the pre-trained language model the first is a trait-oriented prompt we use the combination of controllable attribute values corresponding to each instance as prompts to guide the model to focus on controllable information where task-oriented prompts improve task quality and disentanglement learning improves the ability of compositional generation with the ability to generalize from seen attributes to unseen combinations our proposed method outperforms classic metrics for both coarse-grained discrete attributes and fine-grained continuous attributes we test various of mae and found removing the continuous prompts decrease the correlation score since the task-oriented prompts are the only parameters that can be fine-tuned and are therefore important for mae we also implemented mae on another pim bird to show its generalization we demonstrate the impact of prompts on compositional generation with a visualization of the concordant prompt embedding of three attributes via pca on daily dialogue cg as shown in this figure these results prove that our method can disentangle attribute combinations and learn the relations between different attributes with the ability to generalize from seen attributes to unseen combinations our proposed method outperforms models that learn an independent prompt for each attribute value with a shared embedding mapping helps learn attribute concepts from seen values to unseen combinations this is the conclusion we studied compositional generalization dialogue for multiple attributes and proposed a prompt-based disentangled attribute dialogue model</sample>

    <sample id="219">hi everyone i'm jian wei chen a research assistant at academia sinica i will present our work a compare and contrast multi-stage pipeline for uncovering financial signals in financial reports this work is done with jian hong zhang wen and our advisors professor jia li and chen liu i will talk about the background of financial report analysis which is the goal of this work and text definition and our approaches this work is motivated by two observations first we observed that the words in a company's report are very similar about 80 of the tokens are the same and the contents are very dependent this figure illustrates the text similarity between a given pair of reports in the continuous years for example the report in 2018 is similar to the one in 2017 based on the observation we introduce a highlighted task and a multi-stage pipeline stage 0 is document segmentation stage 1 is the relation combination stage 2 and stage 2 plus are in-domain fine-tuning is a natural language inference dataset with token annotation for example the word frontier is the visionary according to the context of this pair which we didn't use during training in conclusion we propose a highlighted task with our released final dataset and a simple pipeline with two stage fine-tuning there are many other future works we would like to try including improving our effectiveness or adding more features or like many other techniques in information retrieval can enhance the application as well yeah that's it so please refer to our paper and github for more details and feel free to ask us if you have any question thank you</sample>
    <sample id="220">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and coal starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="222">hi everyone the title of this work is to adapt or to annotate challenges and interventions in open domain question answering to motivate this work let's look at this question what is produced in the plants of narora kakrapur tharapur so in open domain qa setting we need to first look up relevant passages from a document corpus in this case which is wikipedia with some retriever model then a reader model takes the question and all the relevant passages as input to generate the answer as nuclear power which is the correct prediction please note that both the retriever and reader models are trained on a general purpose domain like wikipedia now let's say we want to answer a biomedical question in that case wikipedia corpus can probably answer a few domain specific questions for further adapting retriever and reader models overall we observe that the retriever performance improves by 8 on average while reader performance improves by 11 on average for this work we make three main contributions first we investigate different data interventions that would be useful in enabling out-of-domain generalization in open domain qa second we identify the type of data shift a new domain exhibits and finally we determine what kind of data interventions are effective for a specific type of shift our setup looks something like this where we have a general purpose wikipedia-based source domain on which both reader and retriever are trained and to test generalizability of source model we consider these seven target datasets spanning across six different domains first we want to vary answer distribution we first perform named entity recognition on target domain we compare existing retriever models and find that the learn methods are sensitive to change in distribution while an unsupervised method like bm25 has the best overall performance now moving on to the second part how do we ascertain the nature of incompatibility the target model and domain exhibits we consider data shift taxonomy in machine learning to understand the nature of shift in target dataset with respect to source model so here no shift is when both retriever and reader are compatible with the target domain now concept shift happens when retriever is able to find the right passage but the type of reasoning the source reader needs is not actually same as the one source model has learned full shift happens when neither retriever nor reader are compatible now we need some way to measure compatibility so what we do is we take some fixed number of question answer and context triples from target dataset and then compute the likelihood let's say likelihood the source retriever model assigns to all context in the set now the probability assigned to the gold context is considered as a measure of compatibility the higher is this value the more compatible is the source model for the target dataset for reader we do a similar thing where we compute the likelihood of all the answers in the fixed set for each question and then normalize over all answer likelihoods to get a single value we just average the compatibility values over all examples in the set now that we have our compatibility measure we can basically map different target datasets under each category of the shift and find what type of data intervention would be most useful for them we find that all target sets respond well to few shot adaptations as they use a few examples from target domain while data sets with concept and covariate shift respond well to zero shot adaptations as well as in case of no shift we don't observe a lot of changes in performance because source model already understands the target domain to a great extent to conclude we experiment with a variety of data interventions and improve reader performance by up to 24 we also show that only certain data types of data interventions are effective based on the type of shift a target dataset exhibits thank you</sample>
    <sample id="223">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="224">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="225">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks therefore this motivates us to build a multi-modal instruction tuning data set here we present multi-instruct the first multi-modal pre-trained model instruction tuning data set that consists of 62 diverse multi-modal tasks covering 10 broad categories these tasks are derived from 21 existing open source data sets and each task is equipped with 5 expert-written instructions so during test for each task we conduct a total of 5 experiments by evaluating the model using 1 of the 5 instructions as we can see using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot so this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategy on the model's sensitivity as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction data sets the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original ofa model we also can see transfer learning from natural instruction data sets can help ofa achieve much better performance on the natural instruction data set so overall we propose the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning data set which significantly improves the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning data set with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="227">uh we all know that language models have achieved great success recently providing a general solution to many different nlp tasks uh here we want to ask what's missing in current language models research uh we think the answer to this question is grounded language understanding which basically means grounding a natural language expression into something that can be executed over a specific target environment which is also referred to as a plan or a program so there are many applications to grounded language understanding such as smart assistant uh like siri and alexa uh and also semantic search on google and querying a medical database using natural language and also domestic robots that follow natural language instructions so all these applications involve mapping a natural language expression onto some representation in a specific environment uh for example like when querying a medical database using natural language to discrimination might be a much better strategy of using language models for grounded language understanding uh we are always open to different forms of uh discussions and collaborations and also we are eager to hear uh your thoughts on our work uh we appreciate your time and your attention thanks a lot</sample>
    <sample id="228">existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor-based watermarking method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it in watermark injection we first define a target embedding when a user sends a sentence to the provider service with the dataset the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence as shown in the figures the provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence as shown in the figures when the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark we first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset the backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set as shown in the figures the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it is hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="229">hello everyone my name is gabrielle skidmore and today i'm going to present our joint work with henning wachsmuth on detecting suboptimal claims for argumentative writing support let's start with a brief introduction into revision of text and why they are important text revision is an essential part of professional writing and is typically a recursive process until some optimal phrasing is achieved from the author's point of view as such optimal phrasing is essential for effectively communicating a message in order to stimulate a desired reaction to get a better understanding of what this process can look like let's follow the revision process of the claim found below stated as cell phones cause brain cancer in the first revision the author further specifies that it's cell phone radiation that causes brain cancer and in the second revision the claim is further clarified that it's not definite and is changed to cell phone radiation may cause brain cancer while working with revision-based data provides many opportunities it also comes with several challenges that arise at different stages of the experiment design process in the paper we delineate the main challenges originating from the nature of revision-based data and from the notion of argument quality specifically we explore four challenges the first one revision and user bias collaborative revision histories contain noise and it could be due to accidental mistakes or biases of users and moderators not only can debate topics be highly controversial and require specific knowledge and expertise but also certain argument quality dimensions such as for example effectiveness depend on the social and cultural context of the writer and audience which makes determining the quality of the text even more difficult to find out how we tackle each of the four challenges we invite you to read our paper where we present detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of strategies tackling each challenge and a systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced tasks based on our experiments we can conclude that revision-based data can be effectively employed for the given tasks moreover modeling the distance between two claim versions is beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims and finally the impact of contextual information is dependent on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from for further details and findings please refer to our paper and thank you for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="231">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 4 gigabytes of set of nachos and a final version of dr bert with a mix of 4 gigabytes of set of nachos and 4 gigabytes of clinical notes in addition to this comparison we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weight and tokenizer of dr bert trained on the 4 gigabytes of set of nachos another also based on dr bert but trained this time on the 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of set of nachos in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gather which port public and private down-stream tasks such as name entity recognition uh classification part of speech taking and question answering these models are compared to six baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 gigabytes common bert 4 gigabytes of common bert 4 gigabytes of clinical bert the evaluation of uh highlights that the model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those uh on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from uh we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from nachos are freely available and uh on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="233">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and fondecyl bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo daniele and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="234">the prompting has a big influence on the performance of the lms for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one-shot prompting and provided two different prompts for each sentence the majority of sentences 516 out of 1000 the difference observed is of more than one bleu points and this can go in extreme cases up to 40 bleu points so it's important to select the examples from high quality translations in particular we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the wmt evaluations or the dev data the dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data that is more normalized and the results show a better performance when using the dev data nevertheless specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the bank translations but palm comes pretty close to a commercial system in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gain from the human evaluation that we perform using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy in particular the most common errors are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style award category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="235">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandes emily wu andrew d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus-level metrics like blue unable to capture these translations and some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when translations require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in translation in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model to answer the second question we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part-of-speech tags that have high pxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high pxmi and this can be explained because english does not have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="236">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models thank you</sample>

    <sample id="240">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well in weakly supervised learning we address this problem setting but this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weakly supervised learning so in practice there is no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="241">hi everyone i'm ethan and today i'm going to discuss our paper human-in-the-loop evaluation for early misinformation detection a case study of covid-19 treatments this was a joint work with yang chen wei xu and alan ritter at georgia tech there have been many proposed approaches for automatically detecting misinformation on social media platforms however all of these approaches generally fall short on two key marks firstly these systems are often unrealistically evaluated for example data sets used for the evaluation of these systems are often retrospectively constructed instead of using live data relatedly there is the possibility of leaked counter-evidence which a recent work found was a problem with many of these systems for example for this evidence-based fact-checking approach we see that while in this first case counter-evidence could clearly be found on a well-known data source like wikipedia for the second more realistic case of misinformation counter-evidence could only exist after the claim had been debunked publicly at which case the system is not useful now we move on to the evaluation of our human-in-the-loop workflow from some of the discussion of leaked counter-evidence early detection is an important task to right as humans can act more effectively to stem the spread of misinformation the histrogram of scores are shown below where scores of four or five indicate most likely or clearly violating twitter's policies surrounding covid-19 misinformation thank you so much for listening and we hope to answer any questions you may have at the conference</sample>
    <sample id="242">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="245">hi i'm lin lin jiang today i'm going to present our work a needle in a haystack an analysis of high agreement workers on mturk for summarization below are our co-authors the picture in the middle shows the two-step pipeline for finding high agreement mturk workers as well as the qualification settings the motivation of the pipeline is that automatic metrics are sometimes problematic and the best practice for recruitment on mturk are also poorly understood so we are going to present this work as shown in the outline here start with the qualification settings then the two steps of qualification task and endurance task we are also going to include the reference-based task is designed to test the annotators' ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly it includes both the training part and the qualification part the qualification questions include three documents one document and four summaries each to check the information coverage in two directions our pipeline workers' result shows that eight out of twelve mturk workers finished all the hits and the figure on the right shows the kappa between different workers and the krippendorff's alpha is 0534 as for the baseline mturk workers we tried different approaches and the best one is achieved by the statistical filter called mace the threshold of krippendorff's alpha is 038 but with incomplete hit coverage and fewer workers per hit in the future we are going to investigate ways to hire high quality workers both in terms of high agreement and correctness and we are going to try multiple applications for task languages and platforms there are also some limitations for this work first only english summarization and mturk platform is tested second the design type questions are not perfect solutions third there is no guarantee for the training of correctness finally we want to thank google for the experiment fundings and thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="246">hello everyone i'm makshata and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmos task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university niela and microsoft research in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models in this figure we show the results of the best performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-trained setting without task-specific training on kitmos both models do not perform well when trained on kitmos however both c2 and bert-coref perform significantly better than the random choice this suggests that when trained on task-specific co-reference resolution datasets models learn to exploit surface cues which are not useful when testing on kitmos where such cues have been removed additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best-performing models cannot reliably integrate background knowledge presented only at inference time to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="247">this is the summary of our paper titled fact verification via reasoning on knowledge graphs the knowledge graph used is dbpedia and the claims exist in two styles written and colloquial for more practical use two methods were used for this first the colloquial style transfer model proposed in chemito is used this is an example second pre-supposition templates were created and used pre-supposition is what we usually say assuming that it is true or false when we speak we use this concept and these are the examples this is the statistics of our dataset finally we constructed some baselines in two ways claim-only baselines use only the claims to verify without graph evidence and we utilize the gearing model to verify the claim using graph evidence and as a result all of the baselines outperform the majority class baseline which is 51 and the gearing model that uses graph evidence outperforms all other baselines this is the summary of our paper thank you for listening you can download our dataset and feel free to contact me</sample>

    <sample id="249">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentences and similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="250">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="259">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the pennsylvania university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found that monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="263">hi today i'm going to present our work mitigating label biases for in-context learning in-context learning is a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models however such in-context learning ability is known to be unstable due to various design choices such as the choice and order of in-context examples prior work shows that in-context learning ability is unstable due to various design choices such as the choice and order of in-context examples and finally we propose a novel calibration method to handle all type of biases so for any classification task we consider the following setups where we have a context that consists of a sequence of labeled examples we have the text we want to classify and also we have some label names we want the model to predict on each of the label names and then use this estimated bias to calibrate the model's original predictions prior calibration method uses some content-free text to estimate the model's bias on each of the label names and finally by using random in-domain words sampled from the task corpus as the content-free text this on the one hand still is a text that is nearly content-free due to the randomness but also take into account the domain label bias by using random in-domain words to take into account the domain label bias and finally by using random in-domain words rather than random english words to take into account the domain label bias we are able to achieve further large improvements showing that it is suboptimal to use only a single content-free tokens and finally by using random in-domain words

    <sample id="264">hi everyone my name is jin wu and i'm a graduate student at georgia tech university in the united states today i will give a presentation for my paper titled transferable audio-visual test generation task generation let's get started currently multimodal test generation tasks like machine translation and image captioning have already flourished as a result of the large-scale pre-training and huge model capacity however for multimodal test generation tasks like audio-visual text generation the main challenge is the multimodal to monomodal shift like visual style audio energy and so on also there's a lack of labeled data for training the model so we propose transferable audio-visual test generation for some low-resource domains with only a few labeled data such as kids and beauty other multimodal methods suffer from several performance degradation while tvb still performs well additionally we conducted experiments to analyze the impact of audio features and span comments okay that's our multimodal audio-visual test generation for some low-resource domains with only a few labeled data such as kids and beauty other multimodal methods suffer from several performance degradation while tvb still performs well additionally we conducted experiments to analyze the impact of audio features and span comments okay that's all thank you</sample>
    <sample id="265">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them cee here we find that on transferring the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 062 further on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning of cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold start the active learning and feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="266">hi my name is adam sperberkovsky and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from read to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from read to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap uh these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts uh grows uh the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is uh we observed that uh this tendency grows with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears so we show that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we show in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about uh the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="268">the most common errors are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style award category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>

    <sample id="271">cft stands for clean validation samples to work properly and the performance improvement claimed in previous wsl approaches can be easily achieved by allowing to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples as we can see from the figures the baseline model termed ftw initially underperforms more complicated wsl methods like cosine however if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and the practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full-shot learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="272">hi everyone i'm koushik mishra and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="273">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context and secondly because a data-driven multi-lingual translation system which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="276">hi everyone this is ananya and vignesh presenting our work on indicmt val a dataset to meta evaluate machine translation metrics for indian languages for the translation task there are several evaluation metrics proposed for evaluating two english translations also there are many studies that perform meta evaluation of these metrics by analyzing their correlation with human scores or discussing the advantages and shortcomings of each of them but what about translations in the other direction evaluation of translations in the other direction is understudied but it is important to study evaluation metrics for other languages instead of naively adopting the metrics proposed for english other languages have their own grammar rules some novel aspects like shared and borrowed vocab dialectic differences and certain settings different sentence structures and varying amounts of resources among other differences our aim is to fill this gap so in this work we focus on indian languages more specifically we study five languages belonging to two different language families we have tamil and malayalam which are dravidian languages and hindi marathi and gujarati which are indo-aryan languages so from the indicmt val a dataset we select 200 sentences randomly to generate multiple candidate translations for each of these source sentences in english we feed it to seven different translation models or apis so using seven such translation systems we get a total of 1400 candidate translations for all languages so almost all metrics show a higher correlation with human scores when only accuracy errors are annotated so having analyzed various metrics we fine-tune the best performing metrics on fluency and accuracy subsets for all languages so

    <sample id="277">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="278">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first use a lexicon of stereotypes and essentializing narratives we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes and essentializing narratives than the human written ones however when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon we find very different things so while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms in more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="279">hi i'm jianbin phd student at the university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political biases of language models on the two different temporal corpora we can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017 so this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models for example if a right-leaning language models were to be fine-tuned on unhate speech or misinformation and whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control so this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political biases so a little bit of discussion we would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases it's like between scylla and charybdis so if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electronic electric chair problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="280">hi everyone i'm shu tao today is my great honor to share my work multimodal fusion framework for emotion recognition in conversations the goal of emotion regulation in conversations is to predict the emotion label of each utterance in a dialogue each utterance has its corresponding textual audio and visual modalities to address this problem we propose a novel multimodal fusion framework named multitenet which is made up of three components: multimodal text multimodal audio and multimodal video each of which aims to integrate one modality with complementary information from the other two modalities through stacked bidirectional multimodal cross-attention layers to fuse the textual modality with visual cues figure 7 depicts a visualization of the heatmap of misclassification utterances in mel which demonstrates the superiority of multimodal in difficult scenarios where the emotional tendencies from different modalities are asynchronized multimodal also have some limitations first multitenet does not distinguish between speaker and irrelevant people in the same second the swfc laws require a large batch size on mel and finally the performance of multimodal in minority emotions are still worse than majority classes that's all thank you so much for listening</sample>
    <sample id="281">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context and secondly because a data-driven multi-lingual translation system which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="282">hello everyone i'm xiaochang hu and today i'm excited to present our new work in stylo 2023 story trends non-parallel story style transfer with discourse representations from the source text and combine these with normal style embeddings to generate text in the target styles we have also designed a new training objective to reduce the stylistic features from the discourse orientations putting the annotation derived from the different texts closer in the latent space and moreover to enhance the content preservation we separate the generation into two stages first we transfer the source text with the style specific content keywords masked and then generate the whole text by incorporating this keyword's specificity as for the training framework we separated the two stages of the training for the first stage we used an adversarial training framework we employed the self-reconstruction loss to recover the input and then the disentanglement loss conducted on the sentence embeddings which aims to disentangle the style and the context of the sentence table mutations and sentence order loss aims to capture the sentence level dependency and finally the style classifier loss tries to produce the style signal for the whole system and as for the second stage this stage is unrelated to the style transfer which aims to fill the correct the style specific content and remove the mask token and finally we can get the transferred text as we can see the evaluation and data sets um we collected new data sets in chinese and english for these new tasks and we conducted intensive experiments to transfer the fairy tales or aerial story to typical author styles both automatic evaluation results and manual evaluations confirm the efficiency of our model and showing that um style transfer outperforms baseline in terms of style control and content preservation and furthermore style visualization indicates the transferred text by our solutions are also aligned with the golden text in the style feature space and this is our all works and finally our data and code included in this this report if you have any question please don't wait to email me</sample>
    <sample id="283">hi my name is adam sperkosky and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination is lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie is the much shorter that this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is uh we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="284">hello everyone i'm pang pang xu from wuhan university today i will present my long paper for acl main conference four thousand nine hundred and fifteen titled fssui a novel fuzzy band mechanism for enhancing universal information extraction the current band-based ui model involves identifying and labeling the band boundaries of the target in the text which relies on the boundary positions of annotated bands however there is ambiguity in labeling the fuzzy band boundaries that is different annotations bands can be considered reasonable so we propose that the fuzzy band attention layer should be adaptive rather than static in order to model the fuzzy band boundary which represents the target boundary as a continuous distribution of correct probability in a specific range where rmin and rmax represent the start and end of the fuzzy band boundaries and the function q represents the correctness of the target position through the sampling function showing in the slide we convert the continuous boundary distribution into a group of discrete values for calculating the fuzzy band boundaries as for the results on asde tasks fssui also achieves significant improvements on 14 lab 15 rest 16 rest of asde v2 dataset and demonstrate competitive performance on 14 lab dataset the result of ablation study shows that fsa improves convergence speed by guiding the model to obtain a reasonable attention distribution and the fssui we proposed achieves excellent results in a wide range of ai tasks thank you for your listening</sample>
    <sample id="285">hello everyone i'm mingjie liu from pitt university i'm glad to share our work reference methods benchmarking factor error correction for dialogue summarization with fvc evaluation framework this video focuses on the key points of our work as we all know summaries generated by models and even some reference summaries still contain factual errors and there are two main types of solutions the first is to introduce factual error related objectives in the training or inference process to make the summarization models more factual and the second is to design a factual error correction model abbreviated as fvc which is independent of the summarization model it takes the source document and the model generated summary as inputs and outputs a score it is expected that the average score of the corrected summaries are higher than the original ones the higher the score the better the fvc models we experiment with some fvc models with different training models to explore some factors of interest with our proposed evaluation framework we have the following key findings training fvc models with reference summaries from dialogue summarization datasets yields the best results of unreliable factual error metrics there is an urgent need to change the evaluation method for fvc models introducing human corrected summaries during the training of fvc models for dialogue summarization can improve their performance combining human annotated data with synthetic data is a promising direction and current fvc models struggle to correct factual errors by addition and cannot address attribute errors modality errors link errors etc thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="286">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="287">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our dataset if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="288">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john bauer michael muller kenisha mishra karen flintus roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="290">hello i am dawei a phd student at stuttgart university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning the training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize well beyond the original weakly labeled samples as we can see from the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we either way decide to access clean samples then training on them directly will even achieve better performance the red figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches which are directly applied on the clean data and wsl approaches which use the clean data for validation only so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="295">hi my name is adam sperberkovsky and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is uh we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination to the right this effect disappears so we show that uh by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we show in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="296">hi i am valerio vasile and in this video i am going to present a work which is a fruit of a collaboration between the university of turin and amazon alexa natural language understanding and natural language processing in general is based in a large part on supervised machine learning or the so-called data-driven approaches and in order to be able to develop these approaches we need a lot of data large sets of manually annotated data which encode some kind of human knowledge which the annotators put into the data by their process of annotation lately there is a series of works which have been showing that the assumption that there is one single truth what's called the ground truth and the annotation needs to converge towards it is showing some limits we chose to focus on irony in particular which is a highly latent and pragmatic phenomenon in natural language irony detection is already a very difficult task for modern natural language processing models and we want to investigate this problem further rather than training models that are able to say something like a binary label like this sentence is ironic or is not ironic we observed a significant difference in the confidence that the perspective aware models show and in particular we can see how the perspective models are on average less uncertain more confident of their predictions finally we went again into the data and we tried to look at what may be the causes of the differences in the annotations and we found something peculiar that is that in the case of age it is generations that are close to each other that seem to be more in disagreement toward their perception of irony and similar things happen in the geographical distribution of the annotators where we found that the highest variations in response is given between the two models trained on labels given by annotators from the united kingdom and ireland this is it for this short presentation but we will be happy to answer all your questions and have in further discussions at the poster session</sample>
    <sample id="297">today i'll be talking about our work from dog whistles to bullhorns unveiling coded rhetoric with language models so this is an example of a speech given by senator josh hawley a few years ago where he's complaining about the cosmopolitan elite agenda and experiment while a lot of people will think that he's complaining about maybe urban liberal worldly people some will interpret this as a screed against jewish people so in this project we develop a typology and glossary with rich contextual information including information about each dog whistle's persona register type as well as real world examples we also see if gpt-3 can identify the covert meanings given the actual dog whistle term itself from our glossary and we see that it does okay but again with a lot of variation and it also depends a lot on the prompting strategies so here for example we see that adding a dog whistle definition and a secret cue so if we ask the model what it secretly means helps performance a lot finally we show how dog whistles can evade content moderation by looking at toxicity detection with perspective api and hateful template sentences from hatecheck so the goal here is do automated toxicity detection scores change when standard group labels or slurs are simply replaced with dog whistles and here's some examples and the answer is yes hateful sentences are rated to be less toxic even in the exact same sentence when slurs and standard group labels are swapped with dog whistles so just to wrap up in this project we develop a typology of dog whistles and a glossary with rich contextual information including information about each dog whistle's persona register type as well as real world examples we also conduct this case study of the frequency of dog whistles in historical us political speeches then we evaluate dog whistle recognition and language models specifically gpt-3 and then we do a case study of perspective api with hateful sentences to show how dog whistles may evade content moderation online thank you</sample>
    <sample id="298">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to new data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="299">hi everyone my name is mihalis karakasgis today we are here to talk about improving the robustness of nli models with minimax training this is joint work with andreas lajos at the university of cambridge nli models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a plethora of benchmarks however despite rapid progress recent work has demonstrated that the success of nli models is partly due to learning and using shortcuts shortcuts are spurious correlations between the input attributes and labels introduced during the data curation process for instance the nli model can learn to exploit shortcuts by being trained only on a small number of examples or by leveraging an auxiliary with reduced learning capabilities the output of the auxiliary is then used to reweigh training instances for the learner's out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy finally in our paper we also examine whether the performed improvements transfer in larger models synthetic shortcuts and out-of-distribution test sets what is the effect of pre-training the learner how small the auxiliary needs to be and finally we conduct a qualitative evaluation of the learner's example weight distribution if you find this work interesting we would love to chat with you during our post-session thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="300">hi my name is belinda and the work i'll be presenting today introduces a task called interactive dictation and makes initial steps towards solving this task this is work done at semantic machines in collaboration with jason eisner adam pauls and sam thompson so what is interactive dictation at a high level interactive dictation is a process where users can use their voice to both dictate and edit a document in a natural and intuitive manner in this example a user starts by dictating just wanted to ask about the event on the twenty third this is transcribed verbatim into the text box however in the middle of speaking the user realizes they made a mistake and corrects themselves saying on friday the twenty third ideally the system can pick up that this was a speech correction and replace the correct span with a new utterance in summary our contribution is threefold first we introduce and formalize a new task interactive dictation second we design a data collection interface and build a dataset for this task and finally we create a baseline system for this task to begin we formalize the task of interactive dictation as a four step procedure in the first step an asr recognition module parses raw audio into a speech transcript next the speech transcript is segmented into separate dictation and command utterances third each command is extracted and normalized the asr miss detections and speech errors are fixed finally each dictation and command utterance is executed in sequence until we arrive at the final document state note that in a real system this all happens in real time as the user is speaking as you can see however there is clearly much more room for progress here and we welcome more work on this task to facilitate future work we have released code at the following site please also check out the paper for more details</sample>
    <sample id="302">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="303">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes and stereotypical narratives in our work we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="304">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair judgments are either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to the latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="307">hi i am yannis lavracque and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 4 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of set of natchez a first version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model permit bert and trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which are public and private down-stream tasks such as name entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to six baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes common bert common bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on common bert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available and on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="310">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="311">the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document-level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence-level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="312">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="314">hi my name is adam sperberkovsky and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is the sum of these two dependencies becomes six right so instead of eleven six much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="315">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="317">hello everyone i'm from university i'm very delighted to present our work titled code generation models about textual information extraction the information extraction is a classic task in natural language processing it refers to extracting structured information from unstructured text such as named entity recognition and relation extraction and so on here is an example of the named entity recognition task we have designed the following prompt first we define a function for named entity recognition that takes an input text as input then we initialize an entity list called entity list we provide a command saying extract named entities from the input text using models like t5 and so on additionally we found that regardless of prompt format the code generation model outperformed the t5 model in information extraction tasks overall furthermore we found that transforming information extraction into a code generation task and using code generation language models aligns better with the information extraction task itself lastly thank you all if you have any questions please feel free to contact me our paper and code are made publicly available</sample>

    <sample id="320">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="321">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="322">hi everyone i'm enrico and i will be presenting at acl 23 answering the question what does a text classifier learn about morality first of all let me explain you what is morality human morality is what helps us distinguish right from wrong is our internal compass that helps us determine whether an action or a concept is morally right or morally wrong and morality is at the base of our societies obviously and it is essential that language models can understand and recognize morality in text in particular we focus on understanding how morality is expressed differently across different domains we use a dataset called moral foundation twitter corpus composed of 35000 tweets collected in seven different domains domains for examples corresponding to the hashtag all lives matter or the hashtag black lives matter these two domains have a similar rhetoric right because they cover similar topics but they have a significantly different rhetoric for the moral element of subversion which means rebellion to authority we know intuitively and we found that language models recognize that in alm subversion is associated with words that you know such as overthrow mayhem and subversion is frowned upon whereas in blm subversion is somewhat encouraged so language models do recognize that morality can be expressed differently in different domains and using just one single model for many different domains can actually lead to misunderstandings of morality in a very dangerous way i hope to see you at acl in toronto and see you there bye</sample>

    <sample id="324">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="325">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="326">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance as two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning on the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="331">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo d'alessandro and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="332">so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle context dependent translations is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus level metrics like bleu unable to capture these translations and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we started by measuring how much a word depends on context in translation and in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model we then look at words with high pcxmi to look for patterns between these words and we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part of speech tags that have high pcxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high pcxmi and this can be explained because english does not have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipses pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that bleu is usually more accurate than google translate for document level translation to summarize we perform a data driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="333">hi everyone i'm wanghao from nan university it is a great honor to be here to introduce our work in injecting curated knowledge into an mt model before introducing our work i would like to acknowledge our collaborators the jiang jing xu from shanghai ai lab xu jianhua and jiang jianchun from nan university and li hongkong from the university of hong kong in this work we focus on neural machine translation we know that the target of mt to learn a generalized representation space to adapt to diverse scenarios however neural networks often induce a non-smooth representation space which limits its generalization ability specifically we adjust the representation by allowing three kinds of representation using k-divergence at first we align contextualized representation and token embedding to keep semantic meaning then we align contextualized representation and curated token embedding to enrich semantic meaning and we also align curated representation of the same target token to address the sparsely dispersing problem overall we optimize adapter with the combined learning objective and run this training loop until convergence in the end of the training loop we can drop data store aside in our experiments we choose the winner model of wmt'19 german-english news translation task as the baseline model we conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and find that even for the state-of-the-art kmt system our ink system also achieves better translation performance with less memory space and faster inference speed to conclude we propose a

    <sample id="335">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="338">good day everyone my name is pingsheng and i want to express my gratitude for your interest in our research today i will be presenting our work titled are human explanations always helpful towards objective evaluation of human natural language explanations on behalf of our research group it is a collaborative work of researchers from rensei polytechnic institute northeast university and ibm research we will briefly present our motivation discuss related works and primarily focus on the contributions which are divided into three sections a unified structure preliminary experiments and an evaluation of five datasets and two models comparing our proposed metric with an established metric our matrix can reflect this observation better than the simulatability score by examining the data set order in both tables which is based on our true scores we observe that our metric consistently ranks data set qualities on both t5 and bart in contrast the simulatability score falls short in evaluating comve and esnli this suggests that the helpfulness of human explanations to models heavily depends on the task and explanation format such as negation connotation in esnli and comve and the counterfactual writing styles for neutral contradiction classes our hypothesis is supported by recent works discussed in our paper to summarize the contributions in our work in terms of the desired data for phase four explanations evaluation we propose a unified data structure to preliminary experiments analyzing factors contributing to explanation utility and the proposal of a metric with an evaluation of five datasets with two models our evaluation demonstrates that our metric outperforms simulatability score for this purpose we emphasize that our work lays the foundation for high quality human collaboration annotation jobs and we recommend researchers to perform similar quality checks in the future for more detailed findings please refer to our paper thank you for your attention and listening to my presentation</sample>

    <sample id="340">hello everyone i'm guanhao huang from uca i'm presenting our work para mr a large-scale syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset by amr back translation this is a jointed work with veron ehong anup kaiwei and aran then we propose to use amr back translation to generate syntactically diverse paraphrases first we will use the pre-trained amr parser to get amr graph of a source sentence then we will change the focus of the graph we will randomly sample a node and set it as a new root node then modify the corresponding edge and the edge able then we will use the amr graph to text generator to generate text from the modified graph for the generated text because they share the same amr graph structure so they will have similar semantics also because the generator text generator can perform better than other dataset in scs testing benchmark for the second application we consider syntactic control paraphrase generation we show that by training with para mr we can get a paraphrase generator that has better syntactic control finally we consider using paraphrase generator to generate paraphrases for data augmentation for future learning since para mr is more syntactically diverse we observe that para mr can get a higher score for future learning here is the conclusion of our work in this work we propose para mr a large-scale syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset which is constructed by amr back translation and we show that para mr benefit several nlp applications compared to existing paraphrase dataset our dataset is available at this link thank you</sample>
    <sample id="341">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo d'alessandro and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we'll plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot and we also see that if we consider the actual lap time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="342">hello everyone my name is gao jinjun today i'm going to present a large-scale personalized dialogue dataset left chat which is conducted by me li xinzhu from southeast university and shanghai ai here is the outline of my presentation first part is introduction with the open-domain dialogue which means a type of conventional exchange between a human and an artificial intelligence system that can cover a range of topics and doesn't have a specific goal which relies on pre-trained models and a large-scale dataset to address this issue in total the key barriers of the existing open-domain dialogue dataset are summarized below to address these barriers we propose a large-scale personalized dialogue dataset experimental on two benchmark tasks shows that personalized extraction is beneficial to the final results besides both the classifier are important to personalized extraction the second task is address recognition which shows that single-stream outperformed double-stream which is beneficial to address recognition in conclusion we propose a large-scale chinese video-sourced personalized dialogue dataset experimental on two benchmark tasks

    <sample id="343">ciao a tutti, mi chiamo shota e oggi, insieme al mio co-autore martin, presentiamo il nostro lavoro the kitmos task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university niela and microsoft research. natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="346">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conll 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our dataset and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="347">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so for instance the word man or sorry the word warrior is usually associated with men so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group so for instance for the personas of black women we see that some of the top words are things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people to be resilient against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>

with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky to overcome these limitations we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned language models are very good at responding to instructions and prompts so we can ask the model to

    <sample id="349">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding watermark the embedding watermark contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embedding and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="350">hello everyone and welcome to the presentation of our paper entitled what's the meaning of superhuman performance in today's nlu i'm similar to this and this is a joint work with several renowned researchers spanning many institutions around the world so in the last five years leaderboard-based evaluation became the de facto standard in nlu and consequently the main objective became to reach the top spot in popular benchmarks not infrequently it happens that systems achieve human-level or even superhuman performance in such benchmarks and we call these benchmarks saturated benchmarks and these achievements quickly spread in the research community and outside leading to us to conclusions such as that some tasks are now solved by these models however by manually inspecting these datasets we discovered several sources of error that make the comparison between humans and systems unfair the first glaring mistake is that systems and humans are evaluated on different datasets in particular humans are almost always evaluated on a small or very small subset of the actual test set for instance on boolq systems are evaluated on the full test set made of more than 3000 instances while humans are evaluated on a small subset of just 100 instances additionally we also discovered that details about the annotator pool are often omitted specifically it's often unknown how many annotators were hired following what process what is their cultural background and so on and without all this information we argue that datasets constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human-to-system comparisons finally along the same lines we also discovered that details about the annotator pool are often omitted specifically it's often unknown how many annotators were hired following what process what is their cultural background and so on and without all this information we argue that claims about superhuman performance are not scientifically meaningful so to summarize in this presentation we discuss the meaning of superhuman performance in nlu and explain why such claims are not yet grounded read our paper if you want to know more about the consequences of the identified issues and in our paper we also provide recommendations to avoid repeating the same mistakes and construct more reliable benchmarks thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="351">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="352">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="353">hello people from acl 2023 today i'm going to introduce the paper python code generation by asking clarification questions by housing lee moses mascar and andrea ftm martinsch and irina gervich motivation code generation and program synthesis given natural language description is a hot research topic however state-of-the-art methods fail to address an important challenge and that challenge is input under specification in the motivating example only the classifier which is the regressor is mentioned with model specifications missing the issue is prevalent in real-world use cases and is important to train code generation models interaction for example asking clarification questions is a good paradigm to address this challenge however before addressing this challenge we have to figure out what the key operations are and corresponding documentation from the code and then we represent them in latent space using their schema element pairs with the highest similarity scores of all schema element pairs between nld and the operation documentation if all item pairs with the similarity score is lower than the threshold t the key operation is missing otherwise it is aligned notice that we also notice that some common errors which reflect the challenge and potential directions to improve our method including taxonomy that aligned operations might require clarification to be distinguished from operations with similar names and argument where we use documentation of operations instead of using argument values as well we also test our pipeline we see that model performances of all evaluation metrics including let's say with more let's say highly ranked sqs being answered and included increases however there's opposite trend of unanswered clarifications and at the same time our pipeline is still underperforming the model only training oracle sqs leads to prediction close to ground truth with only minor differences however the task is challenging as the top five ranked sqs do not include sqs in the reference sqs leading to the pipeline prediction including a confusion matrix but missing the classes mentioned here so thank you for listening and please check out our paper and code and we are looking for your feedback</sample>
    <sample id="354">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conll 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to new data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our dataset and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="355">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship and dissonance and we find that on transferring the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with a uc of 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="356">hi my name is mathias lendemer and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="358">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandes emily wu andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we started by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence and in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these context phenomena we then use the multi-tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our
