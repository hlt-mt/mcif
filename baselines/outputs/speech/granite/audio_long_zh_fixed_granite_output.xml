    <sample id="0">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="2">hello everyone i am jiwei from edgroup and here i'm going to be presenting our team's paper on document understanding the co-authors of this paper are all algorithm engineers from edgroup and this article is derived from our working practice in this paper we focus on the visually rich document understanding problem it aims to understand various types of documents like forms receipts and posters in recent years pre-training techniques have been introduced into this area and the self-supervised pre-training models have demonstrated great success in various related tasks however existing document pre-training models suffer from reading order issues following the idiom word deposition which is used to infer the context for each word based on the semantic relations and the spatial relations from a spatial perspective the joint learning process with both semantic and spatial interests can promote textual relations and help models to learn better layout presentations in our experiments we compare the performance of the layout masking strategies on both sri and sire datasets and their entity total has both vertical layouts and horizontal layouts and has multimodal misleading numbers with the same content as the ground truth so it is hard to recognize entity total by using the ordinary reading order implied by the global wording based on this we are speeding up our research using global wording to help form better sensitivities more adaptive to such cases for more details of the paper please refer to our paper and posters thanks for watching if you have any question please send me emails</sample>
    <sample id="3">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification or the overall level of simplification and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>

    <sample id="7">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="8">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="12">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect in weak supervised learning we address the following research questions first is clean validation samples necessary for weak supervised learning or can we maybe use a noisy validation samples instead second if clean data is required or if clean data is mandatory for weak supervised learning to work properly as we can see from the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="13">hello everybody my name is daniel rotem and i will be presenting my work finding the sweet spot analysis and improvement of adaptive inference in low resource settings which was done in professor roy schwartz's lab at the hebrew university in jerusalem adaptive inference is a method for reducing the inference time of large language models to use it we rely on the fact that real world data varies in complexity therefore we can use low capacity models for easy samples and therefore in that way reduce the average inference cost whether it be time or money the two most common adaptive inference methods are multimodel and early exit in multimodel multiple models are stored together each fit with a classifier at the end they are trained separately on the entire training set and for inference we run a sample through the model until a classifier decides to halt that way saving the computation which would have been exhausted by the rest of the model in order to test our hypothesis we compared individual early exit models classifiers with separate multimodel classifiers which are truncated versions of the bert pre-trained language models the takeaways from our work are as follows we show the existence of conflicting gradients in early exit training process to the best of our knowledge we conduct the first fair comparison of early exit and multimodel adaptive inference methods we also introduce the sweet method the results of which motivate future research of fine tuning algorithms tailored to the early exit architecture thank you very much for listening if you enjoyed the talk and you want to see more go visit our paper on archive finding the sweet spot</sample>
    <sample id="14">hi my name is adam barton and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case lisa barton and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so we get dependencies from read to all the conjuncts and finally this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears so we showed that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we showed in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="15">hi my name is mathias lendemann and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="17">hi everyone my name is jinchuan wu a phd student in ais i'm glad to introduce our work about multimodal relation extraction relation extraction is a widely explored task it aims to determine the semantic relation between entities in a given text however in some realistic scenarios such as in social media the data is often in various forms and modalities rather than just pure text so if you just look at the text you may find that lacks sufficient context to understand some ambiguous or multisense words so multimodal relation extraction has been introduced recently additional visual sources are added to the textual relation extraction and then we consider taking multimodal topic information as additional semantic supplementary to enrich the overall context to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method we conduct experiments on a widely used mmr dataset as seen from the table compared with the text-based method leveraging video features can obtain higher performances and we see that all proposed methods can get the best performance among the multimodal baselines in the ablation study we find that the information screening and compensating both contribute to the task performances and the syngraph is beneficial for structural modeling of the multimodal inputs when removing the syngraph the performances get decreased next we want to know under what circumstance do the internal information screening and external information exploiting help so we group the instances by text relevance scores and make the predictions for different groups for the inputs with higher text relevance relevance the syngraph contributes more significantly than gene that means the external information exploiting is more useful in conclusion we introduce a novel idea of simultaneous information subtraction and addition for multimodal relation extraction we perform internal information screening with the guidance of the graph information bot-like principle we devise a latent multimodal topic model and induce latent multimodal topic features to enrich the feature context our overall system achieves significant improvements over the existing best models on the benchmark so thanks a lot if you are interested in our work you can scan the qr code for more detailed information thank you</sample>

    <sample id="22">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="23">hi i'm dan garrett and i'm going to talk about our work on improving the ability for text to image models to render visual text text to image modeling research has made huge strides in the last year with the ability to generate very high quality interesting images but a lot of people have noticed that these models are often very bad at representing text so we specifically look at the t5 model which works by taking the input text encoding it with a t5xl encoder and then using that encoded text representation as input to a diffusion model which is actually able to generate the image here we can see a fairly complex input producing an accurate image output however even a much simpler text input that requires the image to contain a word will often fail to understand what's going on here we can dig into the text encoder itself t5 uses sentence piece tokenization which means that instead of the model receiving the individual letters that make up the spelling of the input it's receiving subword ids for chunks of the input string that means if it's asked to render a word it has to be able to decompose that atomic subword vocabulary item into the individual letters that make up the spelling and that's because the way the sentence piece algorithm works is that more frequent words tend to be represented by a single vocabulary item or a couple of subwords and so that means that the model is having to take a smaller number of bigger chunks and decompose it into a larger number of letters so here again we can see that t5 because it has full access to the character level information does very well and isn't affected by the frequency of the word all it has to do is learn how to copy the input characters to the output and so you can see in this graph here that across all scales t5 does very well at spelling and that's because the way the sentence piece algorithm works is that more frequent words tend to be represented by a single vocabulary item or a couple of subwords and so that means that the model is having to take a smaller number of bigger chunks and decompose it into a larger number of letters so the main takeaways from our paper are the wiki spell benchmark for text only models the draw text benchmark for text to image models and a new efficient strategy for improving model spelling ability which is to concatenate in a model that's actually aware of the characters in the input</sample>

    <sample id="26">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them cee here we find that on transferring the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 062 further on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold start the active learning process feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="27">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="28">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the altentities corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our dataset for example the one without words not the one with the 12-year-old and 12-year-old boy or the fictional one or comes from other voyage and so on the altentities corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x large model are summarized below if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="30">hello everyone we are going to introduce our paper blender which is a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework for large language models and this key idea is based on pairwise ranking and generative fusion so there are so many large language models released every week and many of them claim that they have achieved a great performance and from this leaderboard we can it did say oh some models are better than the others but this is only about average overall performance and when you have a particular input x we can select and generate a better output than using any single model for our input x and given the comparison matrix here and where each element in this matrix represents the comparison logic for candidate i being better than candidate j then from this matrix we can have three methods to aggregate all these results and we found that using the mean average is the best solution but if you worry about the efficiency you can also use bubble sort algorithm here and then it's very efficient and we can also get a decent performance so experiments here show that pairwise ranking is much better correlated with oracle ranking better than all the other ranking methods on various correlation metrics so to evaluate to enable the evaluation of ensemble learning framework for large language models we also create a new data set named mix instruct so it consists of existing instruction data sets and we collect the candidates from 11 open source legendary models here and these results suggest that blender is a very promising framework for ensemble learning although it's very simple and straightforward so in the end we want to give some take home messages here so blender is a simple and effective ensemble learning framework for large language models it has two sub-modules pairwise ranking is a pairwise first module that we can get the matrix for all these results and then user can take the top three candidates and generate the final output and it largely improved the performance and mix instruct is our data set for evaluating the black box models here and we also release a unified data code base and our data for evaluation and future research okay so that's all thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="31">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakkalis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="34">so let's say we have an input like this one we pass this input to a rationalizer model which has a trainable masker component that learns to highlight meaningful rationales that are then passed to a predictor module that produces a final decision finally to effectively leverage the paired structure of the inputs we add a new regularization term that encourages the new rationales to be similar to those originally generated by crest generation we see that crest rationalization produces the top accuracy on crest itself and for contrastive data sets it performs on par with data augmentation using human counterfactuals and finally for auto domain data sets it outperforms their methods these results are great they basically show us that we can use crest counterfactuals to improve downstream models so now we ask are the rationales generated by crest interpretable and we do this analysis in three dimensions in terms of plausibility forward similability and a new proposed metric that we call counterfactual similability intuitively this metric measures the ability of an explanation z to change the classifier's decision when the classifier receives as input a contrastive addition that was guided by this explanation so here are the results overall we note that crest rationalization produces more plausible rationales than other approaches and that these rationales also achieve a higher counterfactual similability than those produced by other methods and this is by a large margin so to summarize we propose crest a joint framework for selective rationalization and counterfactual generation that produces valid fluent and diverse counterfactuals in a controllable way and that by leveraging these counterfactuals during training it leads to plausible explanations that focus on the contrasted parts of the input take a look at our paper and our code for more information thank you</sample>
    <sample id="36">hi welcome to acl i'm tanshu liao and this is a sneak peek into language specific layers for multilingual machine translation joint work with robin schmidt yi chen liao and stefan bitz multilingual machine translation has several advantages namely scalability as it's easier to train and maintain a single model rather than one model per language direction speed because you can directly translate between any two languages instead of having to pivot through a third language like english and this also leads to lesser cascade finally you get improvements for low resource language pairs on the other hand it also means a larger model size and while you can increase the model size that makes training harder and inference slower our goal in this work is to increase the capacity per language but only where it matters the most and while at the same time keeping the inference cost constant to select the placement we tried several approaches including introducing a prior on the weights to try to make them sparse however the approach that we show on the paper and the one that performed the best in our experiments was to simply select the component based on which weight is the largest so for example for the bottom layer the largest weight is the shared weight so that's going to be a shared layer so if you do that you're going to get an architecture like the one we show here where the bottom two layers are shared the next two layers are source specific lsls then we have a few more shared layers then three target specific lsls and the top layer is shared in this case we're showing a target specific decoder model but in the paper we also show results for shared decoder models so our architectures are all based on a deep encoder shallow decoder model we report numbers for a baseline model which is a regular transformer model with no language specific layers but with different embedding sizes and also for language adapters and our learned architecture so you can see that our learned architecture in green has significant improvements over both the language adapters approach and even the largest baseline model even though our approach at inference time is significantly faster which you can check in our appendix so the previous numbers i showed are averages over all the languages which in our case means 90 different translation directions here in the stable we show averages per language and you can see the same trend our approach gives improvements for every language and in particular these improvements are large for the low resource languages also i run statistically significant tests and we found that our improvements are significant for 84 out of the nine translation directions so that's it for the short peek into the paper if you have more questions or you want to see more setups like shared or separate decoder ablation studies different metrics please check out the full paper or come see us at our poster session thank you very much and enjoy acl bye bye</sample>
    <sample id="37">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so when people are describing a woman they'll usually actually specify woman and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance um there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure um on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening um have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="38">this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case lisa read and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine march read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter dependencies are preferred so these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from red to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from red to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter this is why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we didn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>

    <sample id="42">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="46">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multilingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context and secondly because a data-driven multilingual translation system which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="47">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric cholli problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="49">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="50">hi welcome to our presentation of dplane a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification or the overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset dplane which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="51">our dataset covers three different domains music books and recipes our dataset collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion setup the cartoon has three speech bubbles in the first bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example the newer one we provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically but the third one is filled in by the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song here's for example the google search result for the song easy on me for the recipes and books domain we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia so the ltd corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x large model are summarized below if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="53">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotation the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect in weakly supervised learning we address this problem setting but this implies that additional manual annotation is required in weakly supervised learning approaches to achieve high performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we either way decide to access clean samples then training on them directly will even achieve better performance as shown in the right figure ftw initially underperforms more complicated wsl methods like cosine however if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="54">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them prc here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="56">hello everyone my name is xin jian from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="59">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it four gigabytes eight gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert which is a clinical model with four gigabytes of clinical notes and a final version of dr bert with a mix of four gigabytes of set of natchez and four gigabytes of clinical notes in addition to this comparison we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weight and tokenizer of dr bert trained on the four gigabytes of set of natchez another also based on dr bert but trained on the four gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on a generic model here dr bert we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in overall from scratch pre-training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the task and surpass globally the result of the generic model here dr bert we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="60">our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice when we show this alternative question to the annotators they know how they look like if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 but this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="61">hello i am dawei a phd student at stuttgart university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or low-quality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="62">hello my name is nitin kaldellon and i'm the main author of this icl paper a systematic study of knowledge distillation for natural language generation this is a pseudotarget training and this is a fantastic collaboration with amir and the super for me at microsoft and my phd advisor rachel wallace so as we all know natural language generation systems or energy systems are based on large language models and they become larger more complex and much more slow which can also come with great financial cost as a result there is a growing demand in the industry for compressing these models and the main problem is that while you want to compress your large model you also want to preserve its performance and this is exactly the goal of this paper we want to explore the potential of energy compression or in other words finding the recipe for distillation we have eight stages and also an extreme setup which i won't discuss in this video and the first two stages explore the architectural decisions for example in the first stage we compare encoder decoder to decoder only architectures and for more details about the study the methods and the first

    <sample id="63">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="64">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as services however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solution is to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as services we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="66">hello everyone we are glad to share our study paper deep learning for mathematical reasoning mathematical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence that enables us to comprehend and make decisions based on numeric data and language the development of machines capable of solving math problems and proving theorems has been a long-standing focus of ai and elp in recent years there has been a surge of interest in this area so our study discusses the task of mathematical reasoning and the development of a deep learning method for it the basic idea is to map an input sequence such as a math problem to an output sequence such as an equation program or proof it is noteworthy that mathematical expressions can be represented as tree-based structures therefore six to three models have been proposed to explicitly model the tree structure when encoding the language programs to compose different tools for use despite the creation of various data sets mathematical reasoning in low-resource settings remains underexplored recently there has been attempts to build non-english data sets for chinese korean and arabic additionally pioneering research has developed mathematical reasoning benchmarks for financial scientific and medical domains despite impressive progress deep learning models commonly display generalization and robustness failures on reasoning tasks first deep learning models struggle with large numbers second large language models are inconsistent with mathematical reasoning with that thank you so much for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="67">hi i'm uri and today i want to talk to you about interference in multilingual translation models these models can benefit from synergy between different language pairs or suffer from interference for example training to translate english to finnish may improve the quality of english-estonian while english-to-chinese might have a negative effect many methods have been proposed to alleviate interference however they are often demonstrated using small models and do not always work better than a tuned baseline for interference in multilingual translation while other factors like language similarity affect much less and that use values that are too high the lesson here is that tune temperature is key for strong performance to conclude we find that model and data size affect the levels of interference in multilingual translation while other factors like language similarity affect much less and that modest scale and tune temperature can reduce the problem significantly without any other specialized method thank you</sample>
    <sample id="68">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakkalis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="70">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so when people are describing a woman they'll usually actually specify woman and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="71">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is jawad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parretti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our dataset thanks for watching if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="94">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as services however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solution is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding watermark the embedding watermark contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="98">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="103">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emilio uh andrew f d martins and gramma big so a lot of translations depend on context the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context the sentence level or at the word level we can think of words that have high p x m i as words that require context for translation to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="105">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="106">hello my name is jatanya and i'm going to be talking about our paper called quest this is work done in collaboration with pete mingwei kenton and christina from google deepmind to motivate this work let's consider the example of jane who's a zoologist on a field trip in costa rica and she observes a species of reptile that is unknown to her in our second example let's consider austin who is an avid book reader who just finished a book and is looking for his next read now jane wants to find the name of the species of reptile that she encountered in costa rica and austin wants to find historical fiction novels set in france in our work we show that the data set poses a challenging retrieval problem since systems need to effectively search over a large document corpus to find multi answer sets where the attribution for different query constraints can come from different parts of the document to construct quest we rely on wikipedia category names from four domains of interest films books plants and animals we then ask human annotators to paraphrase templated queries where they ensure that the paraphrased queries have the same meaning and are fluent another set of annotators then validate these queries for fluency and naturalness which we use to filter the set of queries finally through our analysis we find that queries with set intersection and set difference are particularly challenging and have the lowest f1 scores we hope that along with jane and austin quest can help future researchers boldly improve systems for their information seeking scenario with selective information needs thank you for watching please read our paper and hope you can come to our presentation at acl thanks a lot</sample>
    <sample id="107">hello everyone my name is xin jian from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="109">hi i'm or and i will present natural instructions tuning language models with almost no human labeling instruction tuning enables pre-trained language models to generalize to unseen tasks in a zero-shot setting and one way to obtain examples for instruction tuning is to reformulate existing user-generated prompts and manually annotate their expected outputs and this was done in the instruction tuning paper and would lead to an arguably more desirable distribution of the instruction space however it would also require a live application with existing users and a major annotation effort in this work we ask whether we can create a large dataset of instructions that is diverse in tasks content and phrasing without any human labeling we introduce a natural instructions which is a dataset of natural language instructions for a wide variety of natural language tasks a natural instructions was collected in a completely automatic process requiring only a small set of manually constructed examples a natural instructions highlights the ability of language models to produce creative and diverse data this is difficult to obtain with crowd workers who usually collapse into predictable heuristics and form annotation artifacts at the same time language models are also faster and cheaper than human annotation to conclude we introduce a natural instructions which is a dataset of instructions for a wide variety of natural language tasks a natural instructions was collected in a completely automatic process requiring only a small set of manually constructed examples a natural instructions highlights the ability of language models to produce creative and diverse data this is difficult to obtain with crowd workers who usually collapse into predictable heuristics and form annotation artifacts at the same time language models are also faster and cheaper than human annotation thank you</sample>

    <sample id="112">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than 1 this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="114">hi everyone uh i'm going to introduce our work on acl 2023 called finding the pillars of strengths for multi-head attention so we are from nanyang technological university of singapore to begin with as we all know the large language models are game-changing from the task-specific models for each field of natural language processing now the large language models can learn all tasks in one model and this is revolutionary however several limitations are identified for example the heavy parameters they usually contain billions of parameters which is not deployable on small clusters they usually require long training time for example the lama 65 takes 1 million gpu hours with our even with our best gpus and they are talking hungary they require huge computation so this is the overall pipeline and this is the original multi-head attention this is feature map extracted from the multi-head attention and we usually use an unsupervised hidden discovery system for example the k-means to to supervise the projected feature map so using the objectives on the left um we have two conditions when z is categorical with the first first condition when z is a vector with the second condition so this gives us the confidence to prune the redundant large-level models so the the large language models nowadays are redundant in real scenarios because they usually they are able to perform all namely all tasks however we only need a few tasks in real applications for example when we are doing machine translation we don't need the ability to perform the image caption so the related parameters can be pruned and we believe this the prune will not sacrifice the performance as we as we uninstall the apps on our iphone and if imagine that if we don't uninstall the unused apps on our iphone they will be too heavy to use so this is all for today's video if you want to know more about our work please do not hesitate to attend to our poster session thank you</sample>

    <sample id="117">the example quality is more important than the similarity to the source sentence so it's important to select the examples from high-quality translations in particular we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the wmt evaluations or the dev data the dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data that is more normalized and the results show a better performance when using the dev data nevertheless specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the bank translations however in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gain from the human evaluation that we perform using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy in particular the most common error are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better-sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style awkward category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="118">hello everyone we'll be presenting our acl 2023 submission which is the improving pre-training techniques for code-switched nlp so first we define what code-switching is so here we have an example laptop mira bag mira key this is a code mix sentence of english and hindi so some of the words are english and some of the words are hindi so this is a pretty common occurrence in linguistically diverse communities like india so building computational models for code-switching is very important but in this case multilingual pre-trained models like mbert and xlm-r don't perform that well on code-switching tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis so our main contributions in this work are we propose novel mlm techniques which are tuned to the case of code-switching and we motivate architectural changes and add an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information in the final representation so in summary we propose a new mlm objective which is tuned to handle code-switched information we hypothesize and verify using probing classifiers that our methods increase the amount of switch point information present in the intermediate layers and with this result in mind we motivate some architectural changes and add an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information content thank you</sample>
    <sample id="119">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parretti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has

    <sample id="123">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="124">hi everyone this is tan jie yi from the national university of singapore and ali baba i'm glad to share our work towards benchmarking and improving the temporal reasoning capability of lms time is a fundamental axis in the real world we first break down temporal reasoning into three different levels the first level is time to time reasoning such as what is the year after 2010 answering this question will only meet the understanding of the time axis the second level is time to event reasoning in this work we include long duration facts as event as well an example question is what team did leo messi play for in 2020 time period which could be correlated to the term frequencies in the pre-training quadrant we can see that chatgpt is close to solving the year prediction problem but later we do find that its performance drops significantly when performing month prediction besides its performance on l2 and l3 reasoning is also not promising even losing to the significantly smaller flat t5l in l2 reasoning in conclusion we analyze and expose the temporal reasoning biases of lms we also propose the temp reasoning benchmark dataset that covers all three temporal reasoning types and comprehensive time periods last but not least we propose a training paradigm to improve lms temporal reasoning and that will be all for my presentation thank you all for your time</sample>

    <sample id="126">hello everyone my name is yusen zhang from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="127">hi thanks for tuning in i'm namguho a master's student at keist ai in korea i'd like to introduce our work large language models as reasoning teachers to transfer their reasoning abilities to much much smaller models we propose a novel technique called diverse reasoning if you see here we don't only generate one reasoning sample from the teacher we generate many of them using stochastic temperature sampling and since these are very complex questions all of these solutions have slightly distinct solutions and that is why these samples can be used to train the student even better and we found that students under fine-tuned this method that we call fine-tuned cot can perform a complex reasoning task quite well now there's a lot of analysis and discussion that is in the paper but we don't have time for that so you can check the paper for more details so the basic takeaways is that simple distillation can transfer the reasoning abilities from very large teachers to small students smaller than 1 billion parameters and this may be possible for other emergent abilities in the future our method with diverse reasoning is accessible and it's a very effective approach and it's also very highly scalable and this kind of distillation poses various trade-offs between development costs and inference costs as well as the quality of the inference so that is it for the video please check out our paper that goes through a bunch of details over 40 pages including how reasoning emerges in small models as well as results on open source models we provide the code and data from all of our experiments even the smaller ones including a thousand dollars or more worth of teacher inference from open ai for your pleasure we encourage you to take our material for future work also feel free to reach out for discussions thank you for listening and hope to see you at the conference</sample>

    <sample id="129">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so for instance for the personas of black women we usually see negative stereotypes and essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="130">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="131">hello i am dawei a phd student at stuttgart university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect in weak supervised learning we address this problem by proposing training algorithms to robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize beyond the original weak labels meaning that the training is pointless this indicates that weak supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weak supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="133">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="135">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or liker scale methods however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods liker ratings on the turn level liker ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue quality since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="136">hello everybody so my name is shazavan and today i'll be presenting the work that i conducted with my supervisor nefisa at the university of sheffield so the title is format an alternative to accuracy for numerical reasoning and here's the qr code there which gives you access to the paper the github repo my twitter and linkedin so let's get started so what's the motivation behind this work so there are lots of real world application for numerical reasoning tasks for example fact checking let's have a look at a concrete example so info tabs has a pair of statements such as chris brown became famous when they were 16 years old and we can see that it might these models tend to perform quite poorly across all these aspects that we've introduced um the original set which is made up of common core and illinois tends to perform slightly better which shows that it might these benchmarks might not actually be representative of the necessity of the real world and what we believe is that maybe a training maybe the word increase is was present to suggest addition where there is a testing the word another might be used um so that linguistic notation is quite important a last investigation that we perform is looking at the impact of training templates so what we have is we've got four graphs zero shot which is the black one in the middle base which is 200000 questions which is the one used to train the to fine tune the models base diversified which uses extra template from jsmak and aqua which is a green graph on the outskirt and this shows that having this kind of language diversity from jsmak and aqua and also mathematical diversity as they combine different um operations as well shows that this is a lot more promising in improving um the performance so in terms of conclusions we find that the existing benchmarks are tend to be unrepresentative and single scores don't help with that and this is why fairmat is there to provide a more alternative evaluation to fill in that gap we find that language and mathematical diversity is important and also that um with other analyses find that number encoding and tokenization are areas of improvement so again you've got the qr code and the links um thank you very much for listening and i do encourage you to read the paper</sample>
    <sample id="137">hi i'm susan from the singapore university of technology and design i will share our work named tell-to-design a dataset for language guided floor plan generation published in acl 2023 recently test-conditional generative ai models have demonstrated impressive results in generating high-fidelity images such models generally focus on understanding high-level visual concepts from sentence-level descriptions and the generated images are valued for looking realistic and being creative thereby being more suitable for generating artwork-like images however besides test-conditional image generation the main challenge is to understand the big picture of the entire floor plan from document-level unstructured text with fuzzy and entangled information and we use a normal language modeling objective where x is a set of instructions in natural language and y is the target bounding box sequence and l is the target sequence length table table 2 shows the floor plan generation results on the t2d dataset to evaluate helpful plan generation methods generalized to unseen instructions there is no overlapping between the annotators of the training set and the test set the t2d model achieves the highest iou scores with a micro iou of 554 and a macro iou of 53 and outperforms other text-conditional image generation models by a large margin this can be attributed to our sequence-to-sequence model in controlling the target box sequence generation based on semantic information extracted from the language instructions in contrast text-conditional image generation models fail to perform well this is probably because those models are designed to generate artwork-like images with high-level visual concepts from the short text instead of following multiple instructions with various constraints for a specific design when training only on artificial instructions while testing on human instructions our method cannot perform well this indicates there is a language gap between artificial and human instructions nevertheless when artificial instructions are used for warming up before training on human instructions the performance of our method is significantly improved with over 10 iou scores increment this suggests that despite the language gap artificial and human instructions are mutually beneficial data portions during training to conclude we initiate the research of a novel language-guided design generation task with a specific focus on the floor plan domain as a start and we introduce tell-to-design a large-scale dataset that features floor plans with neutral language instructions to describe user preferences and we then propose a sequence-to-sequence model as a strong baseline and compare it with several text-conditional image generation models we hope this paper will serve as a foundation and propel further research on the task of language-guided design generation and that's all thanks for the listening</sample>

    <sample id="141">now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the muda tagger has identified and finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate models on the document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that belle is usually more accurate than google translate for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="146">hi everyone i'm jialei chen a phd student from fudan university now i will give you a talk about our paper on the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization first i'm going to briefly introduce the background of dialogue summarization dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization it is the process of creating a concise summary that represents the most important information within a dialogue there are many scenarios in dialogue summarization how to extract the key information of dialogues in different domains is valuable and worth exploring recent years we have achieved great progress in dialogue summarization especially using large-scale pre-trained language models which can generate fluent and coherent summaries however there are no omission-related datasets in dialogue summarization to support such analysis and detection tasks so in this work we construct the old dataset which provides high-quality omission labels for dialogue summarization our dataset is built upon five existing benchmarks covering five domains for each dialogue we use different abstractive models to generate diverse summaries we further propose an automatic method to produce omission labels for these candidate summaries to ensure the quality of labels we also perform human evaluation to assess the quality of our omission detection models furthermore we calculate the percentage of good omission words that are hit in the detected utterances to measure the word-level omission recall denoted as f1 score the figure above shows the label imbalance problem exists in the dataset for the results in the table you can find that the f1 score is around fifty percent this performance indicates that the task is very challenging which calls for more advanced detection models that's all for the introduction if there is any question please contact me thank you</sample>

    <sample id="148">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and from the center for machine intelligence and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is above a certain threshold alpha that is the lambda speech frames this means that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda speech frames this means that

    <sample id="149">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="150">hello everyone i'm archikey and i'll be presenting our acl paper meeting qa extractive question answering on meeting transcripts i'm really thankful to all my collaborators from adobe research and unc chapel hill we know that millions of meetings take place every day worldwide this results in vast amounts of meeting transcripts that can serve as a new domain for nlp research what makes this domain unique and interesting is that meeting transcripts are long documents which are often domain-specific and information-rich however prior works in this area only focus on the task of summarization and extracting action items this means they underutilize the inherently significant qa component in meeting discussions typically a participant in a meeting will ask a question which elicits detailed responses and discussions from others we address this gap by introducing a new dataset called meeting qa an extractive question answering dataset based on questions asked by participants in a meeting and the corresponding answer sentences here is an example from meeting qa with the question shown in red and the answers are highlighted in blue as seen in the figure questions asked by participants are bad at identifying rhetorical questions especially in the zero-shot setting also predicting the single-span models contain more irrelevant sentences than their multi-span counterparts the bottom half of the figure shows that models struggle to identify which speaker answers a question and this gets worse in the zero-shot setting to summarize meeting qa is an interesting dataset based on open-ended and discussion-seeking questions in real-life meeting scenarios and the dataset is far from being solved as it is challenging for existing qa models in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings thank you so much for listening and you can find more details on our project page or in our paper</sample>

    <sample id="152">hello everyone my name is frederik riemenschneider and i'm here to talk about our work at the fascinating intersection of nlp and classical philology in this presentation titled exploring large language models for classical philology we will introduce valuable resources for ancient greek and latin moreover we will explore the implications and challenges of multilinguality in these models before we dive in let's take a quick look at the current landscape of language models in classics there have been several models recently developed latin bird was introduced in 2020 then came ancient greek bird in 2021 and another ancient greek bird was released just last year in 2022 so in essence we have varied our models along two dimensions language and architecture the first step in building these models is to gather pre-training data for ancient greek previous models have relied on open greek and latin which we naturally also use but in addition we leveraged previously unused resources the corpus corpus for latin and for english we used english text that are somehow related to antiquity lastly does our multilingual model perform better because it can learn from three languages results have shown that our models significantly outperform previous models however there doesn't seem to be a significant difference between the performances of the multilingual and the monolingual models this is the case both for semantic knowledge as well as world knowledge to conclude we have presented new powerful language models for classical philology that are initialized from scratch and use a native tokenizer we pre-trained both encoder only and encoder decoder architectures as well as multilingual models so that latin and greek text can be processed by the same model additionally we have introduced a high quality pre-training data set for ancient greek we have rigorously benchmarked previous and our own models we have analyzed how t5's encoder behaves and we have investigated the implications of multilinguality in our language models this video provides only a brief overview of what we did for more details check out our paper thank you for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="153">hello my name is nina remehabi i'm a postdoctoral scientist at amazon alexa ai's responsible ai team and i will present our work resolving ambiguities in text to image models in this work we were interested in studying ambiguities in prompts provided to text to image models and our goal is to propose frameworks to mitigate such ambiguities as well as frameworks to evaluate whether the generated images are faithful to users' intention here is our pipeline first we curate a benchmark dataset that covers different types of ambiguities then these prompts are provided to prompt disambiguation framework that tries to gather external signal to disambiguate a prompt through either asking clarifying questions from the user or generating different possible visual setups and the user will interact with the system and provide the answer that satisfies its intention and we are going to obtain a disambiguated prompt by concatenating the signal to the original ambiguous prompt notice that it's possible that the user's intention is satisfied in the image or not if the answer is yes it means that the user's intention is satisfied so the image is faithful if the answer is no it means that the generation was not faithful to user's intention and we also have additional findings and discussions in the paper so if you're interested please refer to our paper so to conclude in this work we study ambiguities in text to image models we curate a benchmark dataset covering different types of ambiguities and we propose frameworks to both mitigate as well as evaluate ambiguities provided to text to image models so with this i'm going to conclude this talk and thank you so much for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="160">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept our model has seen shallower recursion but is tested on an example with deeper recursion conceptually our permutations model works roughly like this we go from left to right over the output and determine which multiset token to put in every position for the first output position we simply select one as highlighted in red then we jump to another multiset token to determine the second token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multiset token we continue this process until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="163">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification or the overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="164">hello i am dawei a phd student at stuttgart university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotation the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well in weak supervised learning we address this problem by proposing training algorithms that robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize beyond the original weak labels meaning that the training is pointless this indicates that weak supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second weak supervised learning approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in weak supervised learning finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="165">hello everyone i'm excited to be here to present our recent paper titled adaptive common sense reasoning exploiting mutually exclusive explanations my name is wen ting zhao and i'm a phd student at cornell university before diving into our approach to adaptive reasoning i will first provide a concrete example to help illustrate what it means followed by a more formal definition in adaptive reasoning starts with a context x emily was stuck in traffic and ends with an outcome y emily made it to her flight on time the goal of adaptive reasoning is to identify a plausible subset of the explanations in z current approaches to adaptive reasoning predominantly rely on supervised methods however these methods necessitate the annotation of plausible explanations which can be noisy and subjective a recent experiment revealed that crowd workers disagree on 60 over a thousand explanations in z therefore we also need an additional regularizer to achieve this to build the regularizer we depend on a significant characteristic of explanations which is their mutual exclusivity in the adaptive reasoning example shown at the beginning we can see that the explanation cannot be both true at the same time and that the explanation her flight was delayed was true it automatically rules out the other explanation her flight left on time by over four absolute point in accuracy and this concludes my talk thank you for listening our paper can be found at tinyurlcom slash zhao dash lipoor</sample>

    <sample id="167">the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document-level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence-level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we proposed those results as a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="168">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conll 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conll which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="171">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the watermark method contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="172">hello everyone my name is xin jian from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="174">hi i'm priya and i'm one of the co-authors of the paper arg analysis 35k a large scale data set for argument quality analysis in this video i'm going to quickly explain why this data set is unique from other data sets that you will find on a similar topic this is just going to be a quick like overview of the special features that we have so do make sure to check out our paper and our poster at the conference for better insight into the results data set collection process data set annotation process etcetera so very quickly what is argument analysis it's simply judging how good or bad an argument is on a scale of 0 to 1 so something like big banks are bad is likely to be rated low but something like big banks have no accountability take heavy risks and lead to major collapses which is why they should be broken up which is a coherent argument which is more persuasive in terms of what it's trying to achieve it's going to be rated high and this just creates a better diversity in terms of the motions that you will encounter in a parliamentary debate setting rather than just pre-selecting a few motions and like for each theme and just better captures has more arguments and better captures like the relevance that each argument has to a topic right so we think that this data set is just a culmination of like a bunch of unique things and at the end of it you are able to get something that is more diverse that has a score for relevance so you are able to capture how relevant it is to a particular theme you have higher quality of arguments and in general you just have a more reliable scoring because we capture it on instance based level so do make sure to like check out our paper and like give us your feedback on it thanks</sample>
    <sample id="175">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="176">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

with essender mush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other

    <sample id="181">in this paper we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models for specific goals with multi-faceted constraints we show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning data sets from large language models we apply our method for building a data set of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script shows high polysemy in the generated specific goals with co-script we can choose smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we find that tiffany tuned on co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most of large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable data sets in summary a way established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use a large language models to generate a high quality dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>

    <sample id="183">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essender mush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our method we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned language models are very good at responding to instructions and prompts so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want

    <sample id="184">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence which makes corpus-level metrics like ble unable to capture these translations and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when translations require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x we can then think of words that have high pxmi as words that require context for translation to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="185">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first french biomedical model dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it four gigabytes eight gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with seven gigabytes of natschos a second version of four gigabytes of natschos a first version of schubert which is a clinical model with four gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on the four gigabytes of natschos show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert four gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on camanber weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on nine of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here camanber we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natschos are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="187">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="188">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with a uc of 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="189">hi i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 but this is not realistic if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>

and we have some preliminaries the first one is non-negative matrix factorization which is a group of algorithms where a matrix v is factorized into two matrices and we can find out that for an m times n matrix nmf reduces the memory requirements for all m times n to m times n which is a huge memory reduction and for nmf operation in ad factor we present an analytic solution to achieve the minimum i divergence between the matrix v and the approximation matrix w in the same manner of ad factor we also compare the end task performance of bird based model with the baseline on typical downstream tasks and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed can optimizer by showing that bird based model trained with can on two batch sizes both achieve comparable performance to the baseline with less memory cost over the existing sm3 memory efficient optimizer here inspired by the erroneous update in existing memory efficient optimizers we propose a confidence

    <sample id="193">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated data set is already much better than chance with the best with a uc of 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="195">hello everyone today i will introduce our work reasoning over hierarchical question decomposition tree for explainable question answering explainable question answering aims to answer a given question and provide an explanation why the answer is selected recent work in explainable question answering can be grouped into two directions neuro-symbolic methods which translate natural language questions into formal representations such as sparql and decomposition-based methods which generate natural language intermediate steps that lead to the final answer however both of them have limitations for neuro-symbolic methods the formal representation can only be executed on structured knowledge base and the text corpus at different levels of the tree and takes into consideration the probability score of both string generation and answering specifically to build the hqdt for a given complex question we first use a question decomposer to generate the leaf nodes which are atomic questions that cannot be further deposed second the corresponding executors will get the answers with probabilities from the selected knowledge sources and finally an aggregator will aggregate the candidate answers from all the knowledge sources and output top k answers with highest probabilities we evaluate our oht framework on two challenging complex question datasets kqpro and music kqpro is originally a kbqa dataset to simulate the real-life case where kb is incomplete we randomly discard 15 percent triples in the kb and take wikipedia as the supplementary text corpus music is originally a reading comprehension dataset in addition to the given text paragraphs we use wikidata as the supplementary kb the results on kqpro dataset when only using the given paragraphs our oht-kb model outperforms existing kbqa methods showing the effectiveness of utilizing knowledge from kb and text together on music dataset our oht-text model improves f1 by 119 compared with the state-of-the-art method exsa with both text and kb the performance of our oht-mix is also remarkably better than transporter net comparing our oht-text and our oht-mix we can also see some benefits of supplementing the text information with knowledge from kb that's all thanks for your listening</sample>
    <sample id="196">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="197">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or liker scale methods however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods liker ratings on the turn level liker ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="198">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentences and similar ways that is when we choose sentences from the same dataset or a different dataset so that is what we call as the mismatch scenario so here the sentences are still coming from relevant datasets but it's not from the same dataset that you are evaluating with and we can do the same for unacceptability case finally we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain such as wikipedia so this will tell us like whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context like whether the context is coming from a different subset of the dataset or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current like to the sentence that we are looking at so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgments so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="199">hello everyone my name is xin jian from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="200">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our data set thanks for watching if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="202">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conll 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conll which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="204">hello everyone my name is yusen zhang from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="205">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="206">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them prc here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple cold start active learning strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting active learning with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="208">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essender mush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so for instance for the personas of black women we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human written ones however when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon we find very different things so while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic so really just only the positive or at least non-negative ones and in fact the lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all so instead to do that we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these seemingly positive portrayals facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="210">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="213">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks and we sample 10000 instances per task for testing and reserve the entire commonsense reasoning group for testing and we select additional 5 tasks from wiki and the miscellaneous group we use all the instances in the test split for each task in addition we randomly sample 20 tasks from the test split of natural instruction dataset uh so we also did one experiment uh we use one instruction versus five instruction as we can see uh using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot uh so we also did one experiment uh we use one instruction versus five instruction as we can see uh using

    <sample id="215">hi my name is adam sperberkovsky and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so we get dependencies from and to all the conjuncts and finally this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left or absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="217">hello everyone i'm getting to introduce our work here seen to unseen exploring compositional generation for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation and we're hosting and working with lulu zhao from beijing university of posts and telecommunications now i'll talk about our works in following seven aspects i will introduce our motivations first previous methods for generation generating controllable dialogue focus on single attributes ignoring the practical setting of multiple attribute compositional prompt module to effectively use control signals we have designed two types of prompts that use attribute-related information from the pre-trained language model the first is a trait-oriented prompt we use the combination of controllable attribute values corresponding to each instance as prompts to guide the model to focus on controllable information where task-oriented prompts improve task quality and disentanglement learning improves the ability of compositional generation with the ability to generalize from seen attributes to unseen combinations our proposed method outperforms classic metrics for both coarse-grained discrete attributes and fine-grained continuous attributes we test various of mae and found removing the continuous prompts decrease the correlation score since the task-oriented prompts are the only parameters that can be fine-tuned and are therefore important for mae we also implemented mae on another pim bird to show its generalization we demonstrate the impact of prompts on compositional generation with a visualization of the concordant prompt embedding of three attributes via pca on dialogue daily dialogue cg as shown in this figure this result proves that our method can disentangle attribute combinations and learn the relations between different attributes with the ability to generalize from seen attributes to unseen combinations our proposed method outperforms models that learn an independent prompt for each attribute value with a shared embedding mapping help learn attribute concepts from seen values to unseen combinations this is the conclusion we studied compositional generalization dialogue for multiple attributes and proposed a prompt-based disentangled attribute dialogue model use 400 words left to give the english content uh we use three correlation coefficients to evaluate the quality of different metrics including our automatic metrics mae compared to human judgments our method outperforms classic metrics for both coarse-grained discrete

    <sample id="219">hi everyone i'm jian wei chen a research assistant at academia sinica i will present our work a compare and contrast multi-stage pipeline for uncovering financial signals in financial reports this work is done with yishan huang and wen wen and our advisors professor jia li and chen liu i will talk about the background of financial report analysis which is the goal of this work and text definition and our approaches this work is motivated by two observations first we observed that the words in a company's report are very similar about 80 of the tokens are the same and the contents are very dependent this figure illustrates the text similarity between a given pair of reports in the continuous years for example the report in 2018 is similar to the one in 2017 based on the observation we introduce a highlighted task and a multi-stage pipeline stage 0 is document segmentation stage 1 is the relation combination stage 2 and stage 2 plus are in-domain finetuning is a natural language inference dataset with token annotation for example the word frontier is the visionary according to the context of this pair for in the finetuning we use the revised pairs the revised words as pseudo-positive labels and we randomly label few other words as negative in addition we mix different objectives we use the soft leveling techniques by mixing cross-entropy loss and kl divergence therefore we can alleviate the problem from low-quality labels this table shows that our dominative highlighting model achieve the best performance on final and even preserve the generalization capability as you can see the performance on esnli we further observe that our methods can benefit on simulation the mismatched pairs which we didn't use during training in conclusion we propose a highlighted task with our released finetuning dataset and a simple pipeline with two stage finetuning there are many other future works we would like to try including improving our effectiveness or adding more features or like many other techniques in information retrieval can enhance the application as well yeah that's it so please refer to our paper and github for more details and feel free to ask us if you have any question thank you</sample>
    <sample id="220">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them cee here we find that on transferring the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 062 further on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold start the active learning process feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="222">hi everyone the title of this work is to adapt or to annotate challenges and interventions in open domain question answering to motivate this work let's look at this question what is produced in the plants of narora kakrapur tharapur so in open domain qa setting we need to first look up relevant passages from a document corpus in this case which is wikipedia with some retriever model uh then a reader model takes the question and all the relevant passages as input to generate the answer as nuclear power which is the correct prediction please note that both the retriever and reader models are trained on a general purpose domain like wikipedia now let's say we want to answer a biomedical question in that case wikipedia corpus can probably answer a few domain specific questions for further adapting retriever and reader models overall we observe that the retriever performance improves by 8 on average while reader performance improves by 11 on average for the single value we just average the compatibility values over all answer likelihoods to get a single value we just average the compatibility values over all examples in the set now that we have our compatibility measure we can basically map different target data sets onto this 2d grid and essentially estimate the type of data shift which means that data sets with concept and covariate shift respond well to zero shot adaptations as they use a few examples from target domain while data sets with concept and covariate shift respond well to zero shot adaptations as well as in case of no shift we don't observe a lot of changes in performance because source model already understands the target domain to a great extent to conclude we experiment with a variety of data interventions and improve reader performance by up to 24 we also show that only certain data types of data interventions are effective based on the type of shift a target data set exhibits thank you</sample>
    <sample id="223">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we divide pre-training corpora into pre-45th president of the united states and after 45th president of the united states we separately pre-train language models on the two different temporal corpora we can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017 so this indicates that language models can also pick up the like polarization that's prevalent in our society so last but not least we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection to nlp applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting at white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting at black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa this will further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political leanings do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social categories there are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models so a little bit of discussion we would also like to highlight that we expose the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases it's like between scylla and charybdis so if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electronic electric chair problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="225">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="226">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification or the overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="227">uh we all know that language models have achieved great success recently providing a general solution to many different nlp tasks uh here we want to ask what's missing in current language models research uh we think the answer to this question is grounded language understanding which basically means grounding a natural language expression into something that can be executed over a specific target environment which is also referred to as a plan or a program so there are many applications to grounded language understanding such as smart assistant uh like siri and alexa and also semantic search on google and querying a medical database using natural language and also domestic robots that follow natural language instructions so all these applications involve mapping a natural language expression into something that can be executed over a specific target environment for example like when querying a medical database using natural language to discrimination might be a much better strategy of using language models for grounded language understanding uh here comes the most important message and the one sentence takeaway of our work so for grounded language understanding uh generation may not be a good idea instead discrimination might be a much better strategy of using language models for grounded language understanding uh we are always open to different forms of uh discussions and collaborations and also we are eager to hear uh your thoughts on our work uh we appreciate your time and your attention thanks a lot</sample>

    <sample id="229">hello everyone i'm gabrielle skidmore and today i'm going to present our joint work with henning wachsmuth on detecting suboptimal claims for argumentative writing support let's start with a brief introduction into revision of text and why they are important text revision is an essential part of professional writing and is typically a recursive process until some optimal phrasing is achieved from the author's point of view as such optimal phrasing is essential for effectively communicating a message in order to stimulate a desired reaction to get a better understanding of what this process can look like let's follow the revision process of the claim found below stated as cell phones cause brain cancer in the first revision the author further specifies that it's cell phone radiation that causes brain cancer and in the second revision the claim is further clarified that it's not definitive and is changed to cell phone radiation may cause brain cancer the final challenge we explore is model complexity and architecture for the tasks at hand it is important that the selected model aligns with the idea of revisions and is sensitive to such small changes in delivery in our experiments we can conclude that a revision-based data can be effectively employed for the given tasks moreover modeling the distance between two claim versions is beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims and finally the impact of contextual information is dependent on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from for further details and findings please refer to our paper and thank you for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="231">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first french biomedical model dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4gb 8gb or more to answer this question we first train and compare 4 from scratch models a first version of dr bert which is a clinical model with 4gb of clinical notes and a final version of dr bert with a mix of 4gb of set of natchez and 4gb of clinical notes in addition to this comparison we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weight and tokenizer of dr bert trained on the 4gb subset of natchez another also based on dr bert but trained on the 4gb of clinical notes and finally one based on the generic model here dr bert we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="233">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be

    <sample id="234">the prompting has a big influence on the performance of the lms for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one-shot prompting and provided two different prompts for the sentence the majority of sentences 516 out of 1000 the difference observed is of more than one bleu points and this can go in extreme cases up to 40 bleu points so it's important to select the examples from high quality translations in particular we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the wmt evaluations or the dev data the dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data that is more normalized and the results show a better performance when using the dev data nevertheless specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the bank translations but palm comes pretty close to a commercial system in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gain from the human evaluation that we perform using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy in particular the most common error are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in the translation however the style award category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>

    <sample id="236">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="241">hi everyone i'm ethan and today i'm going to discuss our paper human-in-the-loop evaluation for early misinformation detection a case study of covid-19 treatments this was a joint work with yang chen wei xu and alan gitter at georgia tech there have been many proposed approaches for automatically detecting misinformation on social media platforms however all of these approaches generally fall short on two key marks firstly these systems are often unrealistically evaluated for example data sets used for the evaluation of these systems are often retrospectively constructed instead of using live data relatedly there is the possibility of leaked counter-evidence which a recent work found was a problem with many of these systems for example for this evidence-based fact-checking approach we see that while in this first case counter-evidence could clearly be found on a well-known data source like wikipedia for the second more realistic case of misinformation counter-evidence could only exist after the claim had been debunked publicly at which case the system is not useful now we move on to the evaluation of our human-in-the-loop workflow from some of the discussion of leaked counter-evidence early detection is an important task right as humans can act more effectively to stem the spread of misinformation the histrogram of scores are shown below where scores of four or five indicate most likely or clearly violating twitter's policies surrounding covid-19 misinformation thank you so much for listening and we hope to answer any questions you may have at the conference</sample>
    <sample id="242">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="245">hi i'm lin lin jiang today i'm going to present our work a needle in a haystack an analysis of high agreement workers on mturk for summarization below are our co-authors the picture in the middle shows the two-step pipeline for finding high agreement mturk workers as well as the qualification settings the motivation of the pipeline is that automatic metrics are sometimes problematic and the best practice for recruitment on mturk are also poorly understood so we are going to present this work as shown in the outline here start with the qualification settings then the two steps of qualification task and endurance task we are also going to include the reference based task is designed to test the annotator's ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly it includes both the training part and the qualification part the qualification questions include three documents one document and four summaries each to check the information coverage in two directions our pipeline workers uh result shows that eight out of twelve mturk workers finish the all hits and the figure on the right shows the khan's kappa between different workers and the krippendorff's alpha is 0534 as for the baseline mturk workers we try different approaches and the best one is achieved by the statistical filter called mase the threshold of 05 the krippendorff's alpha is 038 but with incomplete hit coverage and fewer workers per hit in the future we are going to investigate ways to hire high quality workers both in terms of high agreement and correctness and we are going to try multiple applications for task languages and platforms there are also some limitations for this work first only english summarization and mturk platform is tested second the design type questions are not perfect solutions third there is no guaranteeing for the training of correctness finally we want to thank google for the experiment fundings and thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="246">hello everyone i'm makshatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmos task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university mila and microsoft research natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time successful models for knowledge-intensive nlu tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-trained time and inference time knowledge in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="247">hello this is jill king from kaitai ai and i will present our paper titled factg fact verification via reasoning on knowledge graphs do you know of existing fact verification data sets there are data sets such as fever and vitamin c which use wikipedia text or taf fact and info tabs use tables as evidence however there was no data set that utilized knowledge graphs as evidence with natural language claims so we propose a new task knowledge graph based fact verification the knowledge graph used is dbpedia and claims exist in two styles written and colloquial for more practical use two methods were used for this first the colloquial style transfer model proposed in kimitel is used this is an example second presupposition templates were created and used presupposition is what we usually say assuming that it is true or false when we speak we use this concept and these are the examples this is the statistics of our data set finally we constructed some baselines in two ways claim-only baselines use only the claims to verify without graph evidence and we utilize the gearing model to verify the claim using graph evidence and as a result all of the baselines outperform the majority class baseline which is 51 and the gearing model that uses graph evidence outperforms all other baselines this is the summary of our paper thank you for listening you can download our data set and feel free to contact me</sample>

    <sample id="249">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakkalis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="250">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="252">welcome to our presentation my name is saikiran thanikella i am a master's student at iit kanpur i am excited to present our work you create unsupervised case retrieval using event extraction this is a joint work along with abhinav joshi akshay sharma and ashutosh modi legal professionals such as lawyers and judges have traditionally relied on their experience to cite relevant past precedents known as cited documents however with the increasing volume of cases it becomes very challenging this is where the task of prior case retrieval comes to play given a legal query document and candid documents are sequentially given as input into the event extraction block for further processing the event extraction block consists of three steps pre-processing dependency parsing and post-processing for each document we obtain the extracted events then we compute an interaction matrix between the query and candid events the green blocks represent the common events further the interaction matrix is used in different retrieval models to obtain a ranking order of the candid documents in the event filtered documents model we filter the original corpus so that it contains only the sentences which produce matching events with other documents note that all event-based models perform significantly above the baseline method this graph compares the performance of various event-based models with the baseline method from this plot we can observe that event-based models have lower inference time and higher f1 score compared to the other techniques here is a performance comparison on the colie data set you create outperforms the existing approaches including the recent supervised approach by mtft bird team to the best of our knowledge this approach is the current state-of-the-art method for the colie 21 document retrieval task in conclusion with these significant contributions you create opens up avenues for further exploration and development in the field of prior case retrieval please check out our paper for more details that's all from our side thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="253">hello everyone my name is mario eder dragon and i'm going to present our work named disorder a double domain adaptation model for detecting signs of mental disorders in social media this is a group effort of researchers from mexico and spain first i want to start with the definition of a mental disorder that is a psychological syndrome which is associated with the distress and disability that affect your thinking feeling mood and behavior there are different types of mental disorders for example major depression ptsd bulimia and anorexia and among others nowadays social media content is massive and provides an opportunity to do research on how people undergo difficulties many people use online platforms to publicly share their daily routines and important events while others take advantage of the anonymity of these spaces to explicitly discuss mental health issues and seek help in this work we aim to contribute to the detection of mental disorders by automatically analyzing their social media posts this type of analysis is expected to support a new technology able to warn about the onset of mental disorders and provide supporting evidence let us illustrate the behavior of the learned model and the kind of textual segments it tends to pay more attention to first we analyze the most likely words the models generate when given a sentence with masked words a sentence we use example from the beck depression inventory this clinical tool which consists of 21 items aims to identify and measure the severity of typical symptoms of depression as conclusion and future work the combined effect of double domain adaptation and guided masking is effective at capturing signs of mental disorders in social media interactions our approach also obtains better results than those achieved by mental work a model trained with a large amount of data the evaluation shows a solid balance between finding users and labeling them correctly in future work we want to explore the application of different lexical resources as well as using clinical data thank you for your attention if you have any questions please feel free to ask me</sample>
    <sample id="254">hello everyone today i'm going to present our research work uncertainty guided level denoising to improve the label quality of this data this is the overview of our framework we first train a pre-denoising doctor model with both ds and the human annotated data to generate the pseudo-label the calculation can be seen in this formulation however the previous method is not suitable for overlapping relation problem as shown in the left figure there are two different types of relation between this pair it is hard to separate the false positive pseudo-label director by the previous uncertainty estimation method in order to take full advantage of the ds data for boosting the performance of doctor model we design the multi-phase training strategy to iteratively relabel the ds data which is shown in this algorithm we compare our framework with several baselines on two public datasets as shown in this table our framework outperforms the previous baselines on both two datasets in conclusion the main contribution of our work are summarized as those four points the first one is our framework with uncertainty guided level denoising which is greatly improved the label quality of this data the second one is the instance level uncertainty estimation method for overlapping relations the third one is the iterative reliable strategy with dynamic class uncertainty threshold for the long-term problem the last one is the great performance improvement</sample>
    <sample id="255">the prompting has a big influence on the performance of the lms for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one-shot prompting and provided two different prompts for the sentence the majority of sentences 516 out of 1000 the difference observed is of more than one bleu points and this can go in extreme cases up to 40 bleu points so it's important to select the examples from high quality translations in particular we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the wmt evaluations or the dev data the dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data that is more normalized and the results show a better performance when using the dev data nevertheless specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the bank translations but palm comes pretty close to a commercial system in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gain from the human evaluation that we perform using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy in particular the most common error are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in the translation however the style award category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="257">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or liker scale methods however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods liker ratings on the turn level liker ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="258">hi everyone i'm zhangsong han thank you for watching this video in this video i'm going to talk about our new work can large language models be an alternative to human evaluations in this work we propose to use large language models to evaluate the quality of samples in other natural language processing tasks so we just give the large language models the instructions and we give them the samples that need to be rated and the humans can rate the samples based on the instructions but in fact human evaluation is very unstable and the process of human evaluation is very hard to reproduce so we ask ourselves a question is there any alternative to human evaluation that can achieve the same goal as in human evaluation but do not have the drawbacks of human evaluation so we turn to large language models large language models as their name indicates are the models that have a lot of number of parameters and there are some large language models that have been shown to be able to follow natural language task instructions so we think why don't we just use natural language instructions to instruct the large language models to evaluate the samples in other natural language processing tasks and all these questions are answered in our paper so if you are interested in this topic please read our paper or you can come to our posters then at a0 and last you may also want to know the results of large language model evaluation on other tasks and all these questions are answered in our paper so if you are interested in this topic please read our paper or you can come to our posters then at a0 and that's all for this video and thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="263">hi today i'm going to present our work mitigating label biases for in-context learning in-context learning is a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models however such in-context learning ability is known to be unstable due to various design choices such as the choice and order of in-context examples prior work shows that in-context learning ability is unstable due to various design choices such as the choice and order of in-context examples and finally we propose a novel calibration method to handle all type of biases so for any classification task we consider the following setups where we have a context that consists of a sequence of labeled examples we have the text we want to classify and also we have some label names we want the model to predict on each of the label names and then use this estimated bias to calibrate the model's original predictions prior calibration method uses some content-free text to estimate the model's bias on each of the label names and finally by using random in-domain words sampled from the task corpus as the content-free text this on the one hand still is a text that is nearly content-free due to the randomness but also take into account the domain label bias by using random in-domain words to take into account the domain label bias and finally by using random in-domain words rather than random english words to take into account the domain label bias we are able to achieve further large improvements showing that it is suboptimal to use only a single content-free tokens and finally by using random in-domain words

    <sample id="265">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with a uc of 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="266">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show that this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="268">the most common errors are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better-sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style award category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>

    <sample id="272">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakkalis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically uh puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding uh like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model uh like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="273">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was couldn't it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context and this makes corpus level metrics like blue unable to capture these translations and some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context dependent translations and this can be explained because english doesn't have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="274">hello everyone my name is yusen zhang from the pennsylvania university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder decoder models such as coder decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of fueled on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coder and blue are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="276">hi everyone this is ananya and vignesh presenting our work on indicmt val a dataset to meta-evaluate machine translation metrics for indian languages for the translation task there are several evaluation metrics proposed for evaluating two english translations also there are many studies that perform meta-evaluation of these metrics by analyzing their correlation with human scores or discussing the advantages and shortcomings of each of them but what about translations in the other direction evaluation of translations in the other direction is understudied but it is important to study evaluation metrics for other languages instead of naively adopting the metrics proposed for english other languages have their own grammar rules some novel aspects like shared and borrowed vocab dialectic differences and certain settings different sentence structures and varying amounts of resources among other differences our aim is to fill this gap so in this work we focus on indian languages more specifically we study five languages belonging to two different language families we have tamil and malayalam which are dravidian languages and hindi marathi and gujarati which are indo-aryan languages so from the indicmt val a dataset we select 200 sentences randomly to generate multiple candidate translations for each of these source sentences in english we feed it to seven different translation models or apis so using seven such translation systems we get a total of 1400 candidate translations for all languages so almost all metrics show a higher correlation with human scores when only accuracy errors are annotated so having analyzed various metrics we fine-tune the best performing metric commet using our indicmt dataset so the table here compares the correlation values of our fine-tuned indict commet variants with the commet baselines so we observe that indict commet mtm outperforms the commet baselines on the majority of languages we then evaluate robustness scores on the asis translation accuracy challenge sets and we see that indict commet mtm has a correlation score of 0306 and is more robust than the commet counterpart which has a score of 0272 so thank you and please feel free to use our publicly available dataset and have a good day</sample>
    <sample id="277">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="278">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked words using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so for instance for the personas of black women we would do fighting words and compare the log odds ratios against both white personas and man personas because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="279">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="280">hi everyone i'm shu tao today is my great honor to share my work multimodal fusion framework for emotion regulation in conversations the goal of emotion regulation in conversations is to predict the emotion label of each utterance in the dialogue each utterance has its corresponding textual audio and visual modalities to solve the problem of emotion regulation in conversations first we propose a novel visual feature extractor named multinet second we design a multimodal fusion model called multit10 based on bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layers next i'll illustrate how multimodal fusion works through multit10 text multit10 text first learns cross-modal correlations between textual and audio modalities by treating the textual modality as query and audio modality as k and value for a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention layer to fuse the textual modality with visual cues finally a feed-forward network is adopted which operates as a key value memory in addition we employ residual connection and layer normalization over the output of each stage experimental results demonstrate that multimodal in difficult scenarios where the emotional tendencies from different modalities are asynchronized multimodal also have some limitations first multinet does not distinguish between speaker and irrelevant people in the same second the swfc laws requires a large batch size on meld and finally the performance of multimodal in minority emotions are still worse than majority classes that's all thank you so much for listening</sample>

    <sample id="284">hello everyone i'm from wuhan university today i will present my long paper for acl main conference 4915 titled fssui a novel fuzziness band mechanism for enhancing universal information extraction the current band-based ui model involves identifying and labeling the band boundaries of the target in the text which heavily relies on boundary positions of annotated bands however there is ambiguity in labeling the fuzziness band boundaries that is different annotations bands can be considered reasonable so we propose that the fuzziness band attention layer should be adaptive rather than static in order to model the fuzziness band distribution the image and formula of the mask function g are shown in the slide where the fuzziness band is reflected in two aspects on the one hand by introducing optimizable parameter delta to adjust the length of the fuzziness band the attention span of the model is dynamically changing and then we propose efficient fuzziness band attention to adaptively adjusting the attention span of the model and the fssui we proposed achieves excellent results in a wide range of ai tasks thank you for your listening in conclusion in this work we first proposed a novel fuzziness band mechanism that alleviates the model's reliance on band boundaries and then we propose efficient fuzziness band attention to adaptively adjusting the attention span of the model and the fssui we proposed achieves excellent results in a wide range of ai tasks thank you for your listening</sample>
    <sample id="285">hello everyone i'm mingjie liu from pitt university i'm glad to share our work reference methods benchmarking factor error correction for dialogue summarization with fvc model evaluation framework this video focuses on the key points of our work as we all know summaries generated by models and even some reference summaries still contain factual errors and there are two main types of solutions the first is to introduce factual error related objectives in the training or inference process to make the summarization models more factual and the second is to design a factual error correction model abbreviated as fvc which is independent of the summarization model it takes the source document and the model generated summary as inputs and outputs a score it is expected that the average score of the corrected summaries are higher than the original one and more importantly it creates the condition for more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the performance of fvc models introducing human corrected summaries during the training of fvc models for dialogue summarization can improve their performance combining human annotated data with synthetic data is a promising direction and current fvc models struggle to correct factual errors by addition and cannot address attribute errors modality errors link errors etc thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="286">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or liker scale methods however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods liker ratings on the turn level liker ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="287">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example the first one and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our dataset for example the one without words not the one with the 12-year-old and 12-year-old boy or the fictional one or comes from other voyage and so on the alt entity corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x large model are summarized below if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="288">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentences and similar ways that is when we choose sentences from the same dataset or a different dataset so that is what we call as the mismatch scenario so here the sentences are still coming from relevant datasets but it's not from the same dataset that you are evaluating with and we can do the same for unacceptability case finally we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain such as wikipedia so this will tell us like whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context like whether the context is coming from a different uh subset of the dataset or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current uh like to the sentence that we are looking at so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgments so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding uh like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model uh like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="290">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision you do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotation the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect in weakly supervised learning we address this research question in our work and our findings are as follows first we find that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weakly supervised approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we show that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="296">hi i am valerio basile and in this video i am going to present a work which is a fruit of a collaboration between the university of turin and amazon alexa natural language understanding and natural language processing in general is based in a large part on supervised machine learning or the so-called data-driven approaches and in order to be able to develop these approaches we need a lot of data large sets of manually annotated data which encode some kind of human knowledge which the annotators put into the data by their process of annotation lately there is a series of works which have been showing that the assumption that there is one single truth what's called the ground truth and the annotation needs to converge towards it is showing some limits we chose to focus on irony in particular which is a highly latent and pragmatic phenomenon in natural language irony detection is already a very difficult task for modern natural language processing models and we want to investigate this problem further rather than training models that are able to say something like a binary label like this sentence is ironic or is not ironic we observed a significant difference in the confidence that the perspective aware models show and in particular we can see how the perspectiveist models are on average less uncertain more confident of their predictions finally we went again into the data and we tried to look at what may be the causes of the differences in the annotations and we found something peculiar that is that in the case of age it is generations that are close to each other that seem to be more in disagreement toward their perception of irony and similar things happen in the geographical distribution of the annotators where we found that the highest variations in response is given between the two models trained on labels given by annotators from the united kingdom and ireland this is it for this short presentation but we will be happy to answer all your questions and have in further discussions at the poster session</sample>

    <sample id="298">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="299">hi everyone my name is mihalas karakasgis today we are here to talk about improving the robustness of nli models with minimax training this is joint work with andreas lajos at the university of cambridge nli models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a plethora of benchmarks however despite rapid progress nli models suffer from poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets with patterns that could predict shortcuts in the dominant easy examples both models are optimized in an alternating fashion using any standard optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent at test time the learner can make predictions without relying on the auxiliary our method does not make any assumptions about the type of shortcuts contained in the dataset it relies on the learner's own training dynamics to generate example weights and finally we use a feedforward network to model the auxiliary we evaluate our proposed method in three commonly used nli datasets and the corresponding out-of-distribution test sets hans symmetry and pulse here we observe that compared to an erm trained model as well as the best performing shortcut mitigation method in each dataset the minimax training objective consistently improves out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy finally in our paper we also examine whether the performed improvements transfer to larger models synthetic shortcuts and out-of-distribution test sets what is the effect of pre-training the learner how small the auxiliary needs to be and finally we conduct a qualitative evaluation of the learner's example weight distribution if you find this work interesting we would love to chat with you during our post-session thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="300">hi my name is belinda and the work i'll be presenting today introduces a task called interactive dictation and makes initial steps towards solving this task this is work done at semantic machines in collaboration with jason eisner adam pauls and sam thompson so what is interactive dictation at a high level interactive dictation is a process where users can use their voice to both dictate and edit a document in a natural and intuitive manner in this example a user starts by dictating just wanted to ask about the event on the twenty third this is transcribed verbatim into the text box however in the middle of speaking the user realizes they made a mistake and corrects themselves saying on friday the twenty third ideally the system can pick up that this was a speech correction and replace the incorrect span with a new utterance in summary our contribution is threefold first we introduce and formalize a new task interactive dictation second we design a data collection interface and build a dataset for this task and finally we create a baseline system for this task first for the segmentation model we see that it's both fairly accurate and efficient next we evaluate the asr repair and interpretation models jointly using exact match of the predicted end state against the gold end state we find that there is generally a trade-off between runtime and accuracy and that generally gpt-3 models are more accurate but also much slower furthermore for gpt-3 models predicting state directly is much more accurate than predicting programs allows us to significantly improve efficiency with minimal impact on accuracy as you can see however there is clearly much more room for progress here and we welcome more work on this task to facilitate future work we have released code at the following site please also check out the paper for more details</sample>
    <sample id="302">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="303">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first generate personas using prompts to generate

    <sample id="304">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakkalis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem we see a massive increase in acceptability judgments in similar ways that is when we perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to the latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="305">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotation the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well in weak supervised learning we address this problem by proposing training algorithms to robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize well beyond the original weakly labeled samples as shown in the figure on the

    <sample id="306">hello everyone i am sebastian schuster and together with najan kim i'm going to give you a short overview of our work on entity tracking in language models for an agent to understand a discourse it needs to track which entities are mentioned and how their state changes as the discourse unfolds so for example in the context of a recipe an agent has to understand that put the eggs sugar and flour in a bowl results in all of these three entities being in the bowl and if the discourse continues with mix to form a light batter then the agent has to understand that not all of these entities are part of the batter and so we argue that this is a crucial ability for understanding longer discourses but there haven't really been any systematic investigations into whether pre-trained language models can actually perform such tasks and so we argue that this is a crucial ability for understanding longer discourses for an agent to understand a discourse it needs to track which entities are mentioned and how their state changes as the discourse unfolds so for an agent to understand a discourse it needs to track which entities are mentioned and how their state changes

    <sample id="309">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="310">hi everyone i'm kostas daskalakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so this is a joint work with john bauer michael muller tanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the mpp pipeline basically doesn't allow us to evaluate language models on acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="311">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification or the overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a base benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="312">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="315">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our method we rely on the property that these newer instruction tuned lls are very good at responding to prompts and so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt so we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt so we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to

    <sample id="317">hello everyone i'm from university i'm very delighted to present our work titled could i last code generation task and information extraction task the information extraction is a classic task in natural language processing it refers to extracting structured information from input text to this function we add a command extract named entities from input text to this function furthermore we observe that when decoding with gpt-3 and test format prompts there are many structural errors whereas when using coders and code format prompts such errors were almost non-existent we advocate that transforming information extraction into a code generation task and using code pre-training language models aligns better with the information extraction task itself furthermore we observed that when decoding with gpt-3 and test format prompts especially in terms of recall we hope this analysis can provide some inspiration to everyone lastly thank you all if you have any questions please feel free to contact me our paper and code are made publicly available</sample>
    <sample id="318">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first french model for biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in french and finally we conclude about the experiments and give you more details about how to access to the model since its release in 2018 bert has become one of the most effective approach to solve natural language processing tasks and offer huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized method such as word2vec fasttext or elmo in addition to this comparison we introduce three model trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weight and tokenizer of bert trained on the 4gb subset of natsch's show comparable result to those obtained with bert 4gb from scratch which is not the case for the model based on common bert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion uh our proper system offer better performance on 9 of the 11 downstream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that uh specialize data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained model obtained from natsch's are freely available and uh on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="320">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="321">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification also overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="322">hi everyone i'm enrico and i will be presenting at acl 23 answering the question what does a text classifier learn about morality first of all let me explain you what is morality human morality is what helps us distinguish right from wrong is our internal compass that helps us determine whether an action or a concept is morally right or morally wrong and morality is at the base of our societies obviously and it is essential that language models can understand and recognize morality in text in particular we focus on understanding how morality is expressed differently across different domains we use a dataset called moral foundation twitter corpus composed of 35000 tweets collected in seven different domains domains for examples corresponding to the hashtag all lives matter or the hashtag black lives matter these two domains have a similar rhetoric right because they cover similar topics but they have a significantly different rhetoric for the moral element of subversion which means rebellion to authority we know intuitively and we found that language models recognize that in alm subversion is associated with words that you know such as overthrow mayhem and subversion is frowned upon whereas in blm subversion is somewhat encouraged so language models do recognize that morality can be expressed differently in different domains and using just one single model for many different domains can actually lead to misunderstandings of morality in a very dangerous way i hope to see you at acl in toronto and see you there bye</sample>

    <sample id="324">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="325">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="326">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with a uc of 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="330">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotation and iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected over the different strategies we found that cumulative performs equal or better than iterative across the board we compare this to the other state-of-the-art state-of-the-art strategies although the difference is small note that the performance is significantly lower for random on further rounds of active learning with two best strategies we improve dissonance classification auc to 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple active learning strategy for rare class acquisition and cold-starting active learning with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="332">so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomena and we call our tagger the multi-lingual discourse-aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to

    <sample id="333">hi everyone i'm wang hao from nan university it is a great honor to be here to introduce our work in injecting curated knowledge into an mt model before introducing our work i would like to acknowledge collaborators the ajin jiushi from shanghai ai lab xu jianhua and xia jianchun from nan university and li hongkong from the university of hong kong in this work we focus on neural machine translation we know that the target of mt to learn a generalized representation space to adapt to diverse scenarios however neural networks often induce a non-smooth representation space which limits its generalization ability specifically we adjust the representation by allowing three kinds of representation using k-divergence at first we align contextualized representation and token embedding to keep semantic meaning then we align contextualized representation and curated token embedding to enrich semantic meaning and we also align curated representation of the same target token to address the sparsely dispersing problem overall we optimize adapter with the combined learning objective and run this training loop until convergence in the end of the training loop we can drop data store aside in our experiments we explore the following three questions the first research question is can we smooth the representation space with a small adapter and drop data store aside during inference the second research question is how much improvement can be brought by using curated knowledge to adjust the representation distribution the third research question is will together using adapter and data store can further smooth predictions which indicates that the representation space of the mt model is not fully refined by the adapter if a more effective framework can be designed the smoothness of the representation space will be further revealed to conclude we propose a novel training framework in this paper in our framework we devise an inject and refine training loop to iteratively refine the representation space of the mt model according to curated knowledge experimental results show that ink system locates on the top right of each figure which means that ink achieves higher blue scores with less memory space besides we also find that generally applying adapter and data store can further smooth predictions which indicates that the representation space of the mt model is not fully refined by the adapter if a more effective framework can be designed the smoothness of the representation space will be further revealed to conclude we propose a novel

    <sample id="335">hi my name is mathias lendemann and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="336">hello everyone my name is xin jian from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="337">hello everyone it's my pleasure to present our work graph based relation mining for out-of-vocabulary word embedding in this speech i will provide an overview of our research and highlight its key contributions out-of-vocabulary word embedding is a challenging problem for natural language processing since most of the out-of-vocabulary words do not appear in the training data we propose to use a graph-based attention neural network model to address this challenge through extensive experiments we have demonstrated that our model outperforms the baseline in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks which proves the effectiveness of our method for learning out-of-vocabulary words by water formation in conclusion the graph in our model can handle various complex water formations we believe the applicability of our model to other languages will largely depend on the feasibility of water segmentation in conclusion the graph in our model can handle various complex water formations we believe the applicability of our model to other languages will largely depend on the feasibility of water decomposition thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="338">good day everyone my name is pengsheng and i want to express my gratitude for your interest in our research today i will be presenting our work titled are human explanations always helpful towards objective evaluation of human natural language explanations on behalf of our research group it is a collaborative work of researchers from rensselaer polytechnic institute northeast university and ibm research we will briefly present our motivation discuss related works and primarily focus on the contributions which are divided into three sections a unified structure preliminary experiments and an evaluation of five datasets and two models comparing our proposed metric with an established metric our matrix can reflect this observation better than the simulatability score by examining the dataset order in both tables which is based on our true scores we observe that our metric consistently ranks dataset qualities on both t5 and bart in contrast simulatability score falls short in evaluating comve and esnli this suggests that the helpfulness of human explanations to models heavily depends on the task and explanation format such as negation connotation in esnli and comve and the counterfactual writing styles for neutral contradiction classes our hypothesis is supported by recent works discussed in our paper to summarize the contributions in our work in terms of the desired data for phase four explanation evaluations we propose a unified data structure to preliminary experiments analyzing factors contributing to explanation utility and a proposal of a metric with an evaluation of five datasets with two models our evaluation demonstrates that our metric outperforms simulatability score for this purpose we emphasize that our work lays the foundation for high quality human collaboration annotation jobs and we recommend researchers to perform similar quality checks in the future for more detailed findings please refer to our paper thank you for your attention and listening to my presentation</sample>
    <sample id="339">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotation the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect in weakly supervised learning we address the research questions as follows first is clean validation samples necessary for weakly supervised learning or can we maybe use a noisy validation samples instead second if clean data is required or if clean data is mandatory for weakly supervised learning to work properly as we can see from the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="345">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps first we tag each input token with an unordered multi-set of tokens that will appear in the output after the first step we have all the right tokens but they're not ordered that's why in the second step we use another model to predict a permutation to put them into the right order we introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not put any hard constraints on the possible permutations this makes our approach quite flexible and expressive in our paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multi-set it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="350">hello everyone and welcome to the presentation of our paper entitled what's the meaning of superhuman performance in today's nlu i'm similar to this and this is a joint work with several renowned researchers spanning many institutions around the world so in the last five years leaderboard-based evaluation became the de facto standard in nlu and consequently the main objective became to reach the top spot in popular benchmarks not infrequently it happens that systems achieve human-level or even superhuman performance in such benchmarks and we call these benchmarks saturated benchmarks and these achievements quickly spread in the research community and outside leading to us to conclusions such as that some tasks are now solved by these models however by manually inspecting these datasets we discovered several sources of error that make the comparison between humans and systems unfair the first glaring mistake is that systems and humans are evaluated on different datasets in particular humans are almost always evaluated on a small or very small subset of the actual test set for instance on boolq systems are evaluated on the full test set made of more than 3000 instances while humans are evaluated on a small subset of just 100 instances additionally we also discovered that details about the annotator pool are often omitted specifically it's often unknown how many annotators were hired following what process what is their cultural background and so on and without all this information we argue that datasets constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human-to-system comparisons finally along the same lines we also discovered that details about the annotator pool are often omitted specifically it's often unknown how many annotators were hired following what process what is their cultural background and so on and without all this information we argue that claims about superhuman performance are not scientifically meaningful so to summarize in this presentation we discuss the meaning of superhuman performance in nlu and explain why such claims are not yet grounded read our paper if you want to know more about the consequences of the identified issues and in our paper we also provide recommendations to avoid repeating the same mistakes and construct more reliable benchmarks thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="352">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer grained level one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality such as the relevance of model responses using existing comparative or liker scale methods however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods liker ratings on the turn level liker ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="353">hello people from acl 2023 today i'm going to introduce the paper python code generation by asking clarification questions by housing lee moses mascar and andrea ftm martinsch and irina gervich motivation code generation and program synthesis given natural language description is a hot research topic however state-of-the-art methods fail to address an important challenge and that challenge is input under specification in a motivating example only the classifier which is the regressor is mentioned with model specifications missing the issue is prevalent in real-world use cases and is important to train code generation models interaction for example asking clarification questions is a good paradigm to address this challenge and that goes to two hypotheses that first our task is more challenging than existing code ranking tasks which is supported by code ranking results and we also have the hypothesis that clarifications help code generation which is supported by code generation results we also test our pipeline we see that model performances of all error metrics including let's say with more let's say highly ranked sqs does lead to prediction close to ground truth with only minor differences however the task is challenging as the top five ranked sqs do not include sqs in the reference sqs leading to the pipeline prediction including a called confusion matrix but missing the classes mentioned here so thank you for listening and please check out our paper and code and we are looking for your feedback</sample>

    <sample id="355">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a consonance relationship and dissonance and we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with a uc of 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class acquisition and cold starting aol with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="358">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multilingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context and secondly because a data-driven multilingual translation system which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="361">hi my name is armina norbach i'm a phd student at the language technologies institute at carnegie mellon university i'm also a research director at the jp morgan ai research team the work i'm presenting today is titled countercomp and is focused on using counterfactual scenarios to improve compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning by multi-step quantitative reasoning we're specifically focused on the question answering task so if you're given a financial table such as the one displayed on the right hand side of this slide you'd be able to ask different questions about the data in this table for instance you could ask what was the net change in revenue from 2019 to 2020 and the answer would be a certain number that's derived from executing one or more arithmetic operations and this is what we mean by multi-step quantitative reasoning we show that adding this auxiliary metric learning loss to the training procedure and that auxiliary metric learning loss has a dynamic margin that is actually measuring the extent of change or intervention in the questions between each pair and using that to adjust the metric learning loss accordingly we show that adding the auxiliary loss to three state-of-the-art baselines consistently improves their performance especially when the number of reasoning steps grows beyond two this is performance on in-distribution samples meaning the model is trained on one dataset and tested on the same dataset but more importantly we also show qualitatively that adding the countercomp loss helps the model attend to more meaningful tokens during training meaningful in the sense that they relate to more meaningful operational terms in the output here is the main references used in this presentation for more information make sure to check out our poster or if you have any questions feel free to reach out to the contact listed here i'd like to thank my co-authors my advisor at cmu and my co-advisor at jp morgan and i would like to thank you all</sample>
