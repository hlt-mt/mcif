    <sample id="0">hi i'm jean gin phd student at the university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models the language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and may lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications</sample>
    <sample id="1">hello everyone i'm mark shatte and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kid must test evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university nila and microsoft research</sample>
    <sample id="35">hello my name is kaiyo yen and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multilingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick frenoux emily yu andrew ft martins and graham newbigg</sample>
    <sample id="36">the ldt corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x-large model are summarized below</sample>
    <sample id="37">so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll-2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes</sample>
    <sample id="38">our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself.</sample>
    <sample id="39">we addressed these research questions in our work and our findings are as follows first we find that interestingly recent wsl methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly otherwise there is a large performance drop as shown in this figure if there are no clean validation samples then the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels meaning that the training is pointless</sample>
    <sample id="40">when we show this alternative question to the annotators they know the name of these entities but they don't necessarily know about the entity</sample>
    <sample id="41">hello i am dawei a phd student at salant university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weaker than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning this is a joint work with xiaoyu shen mario smith and giuseppe stefan and david schlanger</sample>
    <sample id="75">this is joint work with my advisors alexander kolla and ivan titov.</sample>
    <sample id="76">as you can see here, the bible texts are much simpler than, for example, the news texts or the language learner texts.</sample>
    <sample id="77">okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the penn tree bank and see the paper why wouldn't you use universal dependencies and these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables</sample>
    <sample id="78">we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from nachos are freely available on eugen face and all the training scripts are on our github repository</sample>
    <sample id="79">therefore, we propose our new corpus dplane, which is split into two subcorpora: dplane-apa and dplane-web. dplane-apa is based on news texts, while dplane-web contains documents from the web.</sample>
    <sample id="80">our conclusion is that for good generalization we would need a better model architecture larger model size as well as more fine-tuning examples and these go hand in hand we can't just have one ingredient but throw out the others at the same time we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though connor 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do connor 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models</sample>
    <sample id="81">however when the governance on the right as here left governs the coordination then that this effect disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one</sample>
    <sample id="82">so we showed that by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears</sample>
    <sample id="83">on collecting around 1000 examples of discourse unit pairs we ran training for an initial classifier trained only on 43 examples of dissonance to no surprise the classifier performed not much better than chance given the low occurrence of dissonance and absence of any prior such data set we are facing the problem of absolute rarity</sample>
    <sample id="84">hi i'm john green phd student at the university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models</sample>
    <sample id="85">the cartoon has three speech bubbles in the first bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling</sample>
    <sample id="86">now we use the mota benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation</sample>
    <sample id="87">hi everyone i'm cost of senna and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra karen fuentes roger levy and atina williams</sample>
    <sample id="88">hi, my name is mathias lendemer and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="89">this is joint work with my advisors alexander kolla and ivan titov.</sample>
    <sample id="90">compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training.</sample>
    <sample id="91">in the context of semantic parsing, testing for compositional generalization might look like this: as usual, we have a training set of utterances. in this case, the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept.</sample>
    <sample id="92">these utterances are paired with logical forms that represent core aspects of their meaning.</sample>
    <sample id="93">in contrast to standard machine learning evaluation, the test set does not come from the same distribution but contains structurally unseen logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="94">in this example, the model has seen shallow recursion during training and is tested on an example with deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="95">naive sequence-to-sequence models struggle with this kind of out-of-distribution generalization and often produce outputs that are detached from the input.</sample>
    <sample id="96">in particular, they often fail to reproduce the systematic correspondences between input and output, such as those that are color-coded in the example.</sample>
    <sample id="97">a popular method to address this is to integrate trees into the models.</sample>
    <sample id="98">the trees are intended to capture the compositional process that relates utterances with their logical forms.</sample>
    <sample id="99">this works well, but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow.</sample>
    <sample id="100">this can be a complicated and sometimes computationally expensive process, typically involving considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms, for example, to handle variable symbols.</sample>
    <sample id="101">obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures.</sample>
    <sample id="102">in this paper, we do not use trees and introduce a neural sequence-to-sequence model that directly models the correspondences between fragments of the input and fragments of the output.</sample>
    <sample id="103">for the first time, we show strong generalization to deeper recursion without relying on trees.</sample>
    <sample id="104">our approach predicts the output from the input in two steps.</sample>
    <sample id="105">first, we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="106">after the first step, we have all the right tokens, but they are not ordered.</sample>
    <sample id="107">that's why in the second step, we use another model to predict a permutation to put them in the right order.</sample>
    <sample id="108">we introduce a new method to predict a permutation that does not impose any hard constraints on the possible permutations, making our approach quite flexible and expressive.</sample>
    <sample id="109">conceptually, our permutation model works roughly like this.</sample>
    <sample id="110">we go from left to right over the output and determine which multi-set token to put in every position for the first output position, we simply select one as highlighted in red.</sample>
    <sample id="111">then we jump to the next multi-set token to determine the second token in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="112">we determine the third token in the output in a similar way by jumping to another multiset token. we continue this process.</sample>
    <sample id="113">until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once.</sample>
    <sample id="114">to give you a teaser of the experimental results, here we compare our method with other treeless models on the cogs benchmark: our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion.</sample>
    <sample id="115">some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging, though.</sample>
    <sample id="116">in our paper, we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges.</sample>
    <sample id="117">first of all, the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data. as a consequence, for a given token, we don't know which multi-setter it came from, which poses a challenge for training.</sample>
    <sample id="118">in addition, sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data, but the linguistically correct one is latent. we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training.</sample>
    <sample id="119">our permutation method is very flexible, but it brings the challenge that finding the highest-scoring permutation is np-hard, that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem.</sample>
    <sample id="120">we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations.</sample>
    <sample id="121">if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges, please take a look at our paper or come to our poster.</sample>
    <sample id="122">our framework works in two main steps the first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators and we ought to do this over looking at the demographics of original datasets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared and so we ought to re-annotate data to get many annotates per instance and to get a rich set of demographic data we then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using a pearson's r correlation score and thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and datasets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions</sample>
    <sample id="123">hello, i am dawei, a phd student at salant university in germany. in this video, i would like to present our recent work weaker than you think: a critical look at weakly supervised learning.</sample>
    <sample id="124">this is a joint work with xiaoyue shen, mario szeptchuk, and georg stefan, and dietich klakow.</sample>
    <sample id="125">i would like to begin with a brief introduction to weak supervision and weakly supervised learning.</sample>
    <sample id="126">in weak supervision, we do not manually label the data; instead, we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules, knowledge bases, or low-quality crowdsourcing, as illustrated in the figure on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="127">when compared to human annotations, the weak annotations are much cheaper, yet they are also noisy, meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect.</sample>
    <sample id="128">if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize.</sample>
    <sample id="129">in weakly supervised learning, training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise so that the trained models still generalize well.</sample>
    <sample id="130">in recent works in wsl, so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning, a common claim is that people say that they only train models on weakly labeled data and achieve high performance on clean test sets.</sample>
    <sample id="131">technically, this claim is not wrong, but there's a catch.</sample>
    <sample id="132">the issue is that people assume there is an additional clean validation set available for model selection.</sample>
    <sample id="133">we can adapt to this problem setting, but this implies that additional manual annotations are required in weakly supervised learning, but like an elephant in the room, this necessity is often overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="134">the aforementioned draft asks us to ask three research questions: first, is clean validation data necessary for wsl, or can we maybe use a noisy validation set instead?</sample>
    <sample id="135">second if clean data is required or if clean data is mandatory for wso to work then how many clean samples do we need finally should we only use the clean samples for validation or are there better ways to utilize them</sample>
    <sample id="136">we addressed these research questions in our work, and our findings are as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="137">first, we find that interestingly, recent wsl methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly.</sample>
    <sample id="138">otherwise, there is a large performance drop, as shown in this figure, if there are no clean validation samples, then the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels.</sample>
    <sample id="139">meaning that the training is pointless.</sample>
    <sample id="140">this indicates that wsl approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly, and the annotation costs for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked.</sample>
    <sample id="141">our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help wsl approaches to achieve better performance, as shown in the figure on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="142">typically, we only need twenty samples per class to achieve high performance.</sample>
    <sample id="143">but that's not the end of the story, because if we either way decide to access clean samples, then training on them directly will even achieve better performance.</sample>
    <sample id="144">the right figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches, which are directly applied to the clean data, and wsl approaches, which use the clean data for validation only.</sample>
    <sample id="145">as we can see, if we have 10 samples per class, fine-tuning directly starts to beat wsl approaches.</sample>
    <sample id="146">finally, the performance improvement claimed in previous wsl approaches can be easily achieved by allowing fine-tuning on the clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="147">as we can see from the figures, the marlina model, termed ftw, initially underperforms more complicated wsl methods like cosine.</sample>
    <sample id="148">however, if we are allowed to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples, then ftw performs equally well as other methods.</sample>
    <sample id="149">in practice, there is no reason to choose more complex wsl methods that require more computation time and disk space.</sample>
    <sample id="150">in summary, we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean, manually annotated samples for them to work properly. their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated.</sample>
    <sample id="151">our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="152">first, report the model selection criteria, for example, report if the model selection was done with clean validation samples.</sample>
    <sample id="153">second, wsl approaches should be compared with few-shot learning baselines as both work on few samples third, continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl.</sample>
    <sample id="154">finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="155">our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects finding that by giving it to human subjects they also were able to surface racial stereotypes</sample>
    <sample id="156">okay so what we did we extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the penn treebank and see the paper why wouldn't you use universal dependencies</sample>
    <sample id="157">hi, my name is adam sperkowski, and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="158">we transfer from two different tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of pity be since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them ce here we find that on transferring the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 062 further on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning of ce tasks followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold start the active learning</sample>
    <sample id="159">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do convolutional 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started</sample>
    <sample id="160">hello my name is vasudha and i'm a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge</sample>
    <sample id="161">and thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and data sets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions</sample>
    <sample id="162">and now for some results so first we use lexicon of stereotypes and we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human-written ones</sample>
    <sample id="163">but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation we also compared different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that deepal is usually more accurate than google translate for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context</sample>
    <sample id="200">hello everyone, my name is alex villar and i will be giving a short overview of the paper: brenting paraphrase translation: assessing strategies and performance. this is a joint work with my colleagues from google translate.</sample>
    <sample id="201">we increased the context length toward up to 1024 for to max out opt and gpt2 models and we saw here in the orange dotted line the mpp judgments are relatively stable</sample>
    <sample id="202">for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our dataset for example the one without words not the one with the 12-year-old boy or the fictional one or comes from other bojan and so on</sample>
    <sample id="203">design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the nlp researchers and model developers positionality is simply the perspective that people hold as a result of their demographics identity and life experiences this is a concept widely used in critical studies specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces and as a researcher positionality can influence the research process and its outcomes and results because it can change the decisions that researchers make relying on the english</sample>
    <sample id="204">hello i am dawei a phd student at salant university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weaker than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning this is joint work with xiaoyue shen mario smith and geoffrey stephens and david clark</sample>
    <sample id="205">so, what is our solution? first, to use existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific parameters.</sample>
    <sample id="206">hello everyone my name is yixin john from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations</sample>
    <sample id="207">we evaluate the dataset both with human study participants and establish coreference resolution models in this figure we show the results of the best-performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-trained setting without task-specific training on kitmos both models do not perform well when trained on kitmos however both cff and bert-for-coref perform significantly better than the random choice this suggests that when trained on generic coreference resolution data sets models learn to exploit surface cues which are not useful when testing on kitmos where such cues have been removed additional experiments with fictional knowledge indicate that even the best-performing models cannot reliably integrate background knowledge provided only at inference time</sample>
    <sample id="208">we have defined three settings of kitmus: first, we have the background pre-trained setting, where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pre-training time; second, there is the background both setting, where background knowledge is available both at pre-training time and at fine-tuning time; lastly, the background inference setting, where both knowledge types are available only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="209">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduced the alt entities corpus and my name is jawad hosseni and this is a joint work with philip radlinski silvia parotti and annie louis</sample>
    <sample id="210">the aforementioned document asks us to ask three research questions first is clean validation data necessary for wsl or can we maybe use a noisy validation set instead second if clean data is required or if clean data is mandatory for wsl to work then how many clean samples do we need finally should we only use the clean samples for validation or are there better ways to utilize them</sample>
    <sample id="211">we also introduced an additional evaluation metric called sensitivity so this measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction</sample>
    <sample id="212">hello everyone, my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china.</sample>
    <sample id="213">so this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategies on the model sensitivity as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction data sets the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original ifa model</sample>
    <sample id="214">this is a joint work with john gauthier, aaron mueller, kanishka misra, karen fuentes, roger levy, and etina williams.</sample>
    <sample id="215">typically, you only need 20 samples per class to achieve high performance in wsl.</sample>
    <sample id="216">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas: using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essen-dermush and dan jurafsky</sample>
    <sample id="217">so some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political leanings they occupy all four quadrants on the political compass.</sample>
    <sample id="218">hello everyone i'm mark shatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kit must have evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university niela and microsoft research</sample>
    <sample id="219">on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and may lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions</sample>
    <sample id="220">furthermore you can see that our deplain corpus has a high variety of different simplification transformations so for example in the deplain api corpus we have much more reorderings and word additions than we have in the deplain web corpus on the other hand in the web corpus we have much more rephrasings</sample>
    <sample id="221">with that said, t5-small-uncased can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models, indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="222">in watermark injection we first define a target embedding when a user sends a sentence to the provider's service the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence the provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence when the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding</sample>
    <sample id="223">hello everyone my name is yixin john from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations</sample>
    <sample id="224">and we evaluate on mt5 and xlmr plus bdr a multilingual setting without that encoder decoder or encoder bdr can be improved by training in a mixture of various languages</sample>
    <sample id="225">however, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities; planning for goals with specific constraints, such as make a chocolate cake, still remains understudied.</sample>
    <sample id="226">we also validate the covertness of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences unfolded as set voca the legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the factorized embeddings and normal embeddings</sample>
    <sample id="227">in addition to this comparison, we introduce three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="228">for example we find that datasets and models are most aligned to english-speaking countries so for the gpt-4 social acceptability analysis we find that it's most aligned to confucian and english-speaking countries we find that dynate hate is also most aligned to english-speaking countries</sample>
    <sample id="229">first use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right</sample>
    <sample id="230">here we can see that as the amount of tasks increases, the model achieves better performance and, in the meantime, lower sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="231">to give you a teaser of the experimental results here we compare our method with other treeless models on the cogs benchmark our model outperforms the others by a large margin on generalization to deeper recursion some other kinds of structural generalization remain very challenging though</sample>
    <sample id="232">this is joint work with my advisors alexander kolla and ivan titov.</sample>
    <sample id="233">palm is a 540 billion parameter large language model presented last year in 2022. it is trained on a large collection of text comprising 780 billion tokens and has achieved state-of-the-art in hundreds of nlp tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="274">and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on</sample>
    <sample id="275">so if we do not sanitize political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language modeling data so it's kind of like the electric shocking problem</sample>
    <sample id="307">the insights we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but the main difference comes from the accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="308">the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the embedded data third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process</sample>
    <sample id="309">and we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english into fourteen different languages.</sample>
    <sample id="310">our framework works in two main steps the first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators and we ought to do this over looking at the demographics of original datasets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared and so we ought to re-annotate data to get many annotators per instance and to get a rich set of demographic data we then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and data sets using a pearson's r correlation score and thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and data sets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions</sample>
    <sample id="311">the cosine and l2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. we compute the similarity difference between the benign and backdoor datasets, which is defined as delta cosine and delta l2.</sample>
    <sample id="312">and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyze of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multilingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder decoder models which is multilingual pre-trained encoder decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets</sample>
    <sample id="313">hi, i'm sijun from fudan university, and i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="314">in everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of written scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="315">previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as making a cake, and shown that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps.</sample>
    <sample id="316">however, previous work mainly focuses on planning for the abstract goals of stereotypical activities; planning for goals with specific goals and constraints, such as make a chocolate cake, still remains understudied.</sample>
    <sample id="317">in this paper, we define the problem of constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="318">which impose different constraints on goal-oriented planning: an abstract goal can be inherited by different real-life specific goals with multi-faceted constraints. a good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="319">in this paper, we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="320">since no dataset of specific goals exists to support our start-up.</sample>
    <sample id="321">we have to acquire these goals first, and as shown in the table, we extend the abstract goals with motivated constraints for human-like data acquisition using struct-gpt.</sample>
    <sample id="322">we sample 100 specific goals and evaluate the scripts generated from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="323">this table reports the overall accuracy of the results. we found that all language models achieve unsatisfactory results on planning for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="324">then, we conduct detailed analyses to investigate why learning models fail.</sample>
    <sample id="325">the results in the figure show that the semantic completeness of the generated scripts is acceptable, but faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed.</sample>
    <sample id="326">when delving into more fine-grained topic categories of constraints, the heat map in the figure shows that the planning performance of instructivities varies considerably for girls of different categories.</sample>
    <sample id="327">previous studies have shown that the output quality of lstm models falls in high variance, leading to poor performance. thus, we adopt the idea of over-generated z-filter to improve generation quality.</sample>
    <sample id="328">we first show constraint types with examples for interactive dpt, and obtain specific goals based on the stated abstract goals.</sample>
    <sample id="329">then, instruct gpt to generate key scripts for specific goals.</sample>
    <sample id="330">next, a filter model is developed to select suitable scripts.</sample>
    <sample id="331">we convert scripts and glosses into instruct gpt embeddings and calculate cosine similarity and similarity scores to measure semantic similarity.</sample>
    <sample id="332">in addition, we will write a script that contains the keywords of the target constraint. we will only keep the script if the target goal scores the highest in the goal site.</sample>
    <sample id="333">with our method, influenceability can generate squares of high quality. our method greatly improves planability, both in semantic completeness and effectiveness to the constraints.</sample>
    <sample id="334">since large language models are costly to deploy, it is essential to enable the language planning ability of smaller and specialized models. creating datasets is an essential step towards this end.</sample>
    <sample id="335">however, previous studies do not enable planning for specific goals, and manual dataset annotation is expensive.</sample>
    <sample id="336">thus, we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning data sites from large language models.</sample>
    <sample id="337">we apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning, named co-script.</sample>
    <sample id="338">in total, we generate 55000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites, we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="339">this figure shows the constraint distribution of codescript, while figure five shows the hyperpolysemy in the generated specific goals. with codescript, we can choose smaller but specialized models for constraint-based language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="340">with that said, t5-small-uncased can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models, indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="341">in summary, we established the constraint language planning problem, evaluated the constraint language planning ability of learning models, and developed an over-generating filter method for learning models.</sample>
    <sample id="342">we use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset for constrained language planning. we hope that the script dataset can be a valuable resource for advancing research on language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="343">thanks for your time, please find more details of the course script in our paper.</sample>
    <sample id="344">before these main steps, we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it.</sample>
    <sample id="371">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai</sample>
    <sample id="372">this work was conducted by the emory nlp lab, led by professor gino choy at emory university, in collaboration with amazon alexa ai.</sample>
    <sample id="373">so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art.</sample>
    <sample id="374">the common practice is to use human evaluation such as asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations on a likert scale</sample>
    <sample id="375">these approaches work well to provide holistic evaluations of overall dialogue quality but dialogue quality has many aspects therefore you might want to evaluate multiple dimensions of chat quality to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model on a finer-grained level</sample>
    <sample id="376">one approach is to simply ask human judges to evaluate several dimensions of dialogue quality, such as the relevance of model responses, using existing comparative or likert-scale methods.</sample>
    <sample id="377">however, we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for evaluating dimensional dialogue.</sample>
    <sample id="378">our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors, such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself.</sample>
    <sample id="379">we call this approach annotating behaviors in chat, or abc eval in short, we developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature.</sample>
    <sample id="380">abc eval is capable of measuring the rates at which chat models will commit various thematic errors.</sample>
    <sample id="381">for example, apceval measures the number of turns in which a chat model ignores its partner or says something irrelevant.</sample>
    <sample id="382">contradicts itself or its partner hallucinates incorrect facts or violates common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy</sample>
    <sample id="383">to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective, we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human-bot conversations per model using abc eval.</sample>
    <sample id="384">for comparison, we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods: likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons</sample>
    <sample id="385">for each of the existing methods, we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue, since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions.</sample>
    <sample id="386">from our analyses of these evaluation results, we found that abc behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods as measured by inter-annotator agreement on 100 doubly labeled conversations.</sample>
    <sample id="387">in addition, abc eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods, as shown by this simple linear regression analysis.</sample>
    <sample id="388">for example, you can see how measuring the proportion of turns with self and partner contradictions explains 5 and 10 of conversation quality respectively while the average liquor consistency scores explain only 4 or less</sample>
    <sample id="389">finally, we checked whether each evaluation metric captures a unique aspect of chat quality using a stepwise linear regression.</sample>
    <sample id="390">you can see how the combination of all abc evals metrics explains over 25 of conversation quality and as you remove the metrics one at a time most of them result in losing a decent amount of information about the quality</sample>
    <sample id="391">on the other hand, the combination of all turn-level likert metrics explains far less of the quality, and fewer of these metrics carry unique information.</sample>
    <sample id="392">these reliable informative and distinct abc eval metrics enable us to evaluate conversational ai with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve</sample>
    <sample id="393">you can see that in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified for example the bots we tested have common sense violations in around 20 of their responses</sample>
    <sample id="394">they produce irrelevant information in around 15% of the responses, and they contradict themselves or their partner around 10% of the time.</sample>
    <sample id="395">with the rapid pace of improvement in the field, many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models</sample>
    <sample id="396">we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="397">so what is our solution?</sample>
    <sample id="398">here is an example from our dataset servin is a judge kea is a baker servin and kea met at a park after a long day at work deciding cases in a law court he was happy to relax the task here is to identify the correct entity that the pronoun he refers to which in this case is servin the resolution of a given pronoun requires two types of information first entity specific knowledge such as servin is a judge and second background knowledge such as judges decide cases in law courts generally background knowledge is learned during the pre-training of large language models while entity specific knowledge is typically observed at inference time we vary the availability of these two pieces of information such that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources</sample>
    <sample id="399">the summary of our experimental results is that example quality is more important than similarity to the source sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="400">we can also see that gpt-4 is the most liberal language model of them all and gpt theories are generally more socially liberal than bert theories and its variants secondly we aim to investigate to what extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data so we conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different parties and corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their political leanings</sample>
    <sample id="401">if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="402">the most obvious thing is to use a direct reference, for example, by saying the name of the song is amy or its position the first one.</sample>
    <sample id="403">hi, i'm sijun from fudan university, and i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning.</sample>
    <sample id="404">hi, i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our works on dr bert, a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domains.</sample>
    <sample id="405">and to better evaluate our benchmark we consider the six settings for training and evaluation the first one is translate test we use google translate api to translate source to the target language then use monolingual model to train and evaluation</sample>
    <sample id="406">so the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked so for instance the word warrior is usually associated with men so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman</sample>
    <sample id="407">the first one is the model architecture: through our experiments, we found that transformer models normally generalize better to new data.</sample>
    <sample id="408">the right figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches, which are directly applied on the clean data, and wsl approaches, which use the clean data for validation only.</sample>
    <sample id="409">hello everyone, i'm mark shatte, and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kit must die: evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources. this work is a collaboration between mcgill university, nila, and microsoft research.</sample>
    <sample id="410">therefore, in this work, we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multimodal pre-trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multimodal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="411">hello, i am yannis lavrac, and i will present to you our work on dr. bert, a robust pre-trained model in french for the biomedical and clinical domain.</sample>
    <sample id="412">in this presentation, we will first discuss language modeling in healthcare, and then we will present the main contribution of our article.</sample>
    <sample id="413">we introduced the first biomedical model in french named dr bert which is based on roberta and trained on natsch which is a dataset of medical question data from the web</sample>
    <sample id="414">we also introduce a comparison of models with multiple pretraining settings and data sources. then, we present our results on eleven biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in french.</sample>
    <sample id="415">finally, we conclude about the experiments and provide more details on how to access the models.</sample>
    <sample id="416">since its release in 2018, bert has become one of the most effective approaches to solving natural language processing tasks and offers a huge performance gain compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as word2vec, fasttext, or elmo.</sample>
    <sample id="417">since then, this model has been adapted to many other languages, such as french with camambert, and in other domains like biomedical with permabird and biobird, and in clinical with clinicalbird, but mostly in english.</sample>
    <sample id="418">specialized models for other languages are scarce and often based on continual pre-training due to the lack of in-domain data.</sample>
    <sample id="419">however, french did not have any open-source model for bilingual american and chinese.</sample>
    <sample id="420">we so we ask ourselves question about what is the most appropriate data source for a wide range of usage and those raw data are a good substitution for clinical data</sample>
    <sample id="421">to answer this question, we compared dr bert with our schubert model, which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we have.</sample>
    <sample id="422">afterward, we ask ourselves: how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data? is it four gigabytes, eight gigabytes, or more?</sample>
    <sample id="423">to answer this question, we first train and compare four models from scratch: a first version of doctorbert with 7 gigabytes of natchez, a second version with 4 gigabytes of natchez,</sample>
    <sample id="424">a first version of schubert, which is a clinical model with four gigabytes of sentences taken from clinical notes, and a final version of schubert with a mix of four gigabytes of natural sentences and four gigabytes of clinical notes.</sample>
    <sample id="425">in addition to this comparison, we introduced three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="426">one based on the weight of camembert and trained on four gigabytes of a set of nachos, another also based on camembert but trained this time on four gigabytes of clinical notes.</sample>
    <sample id="427">and finally one based on an english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of snapshots in total we have seven models</sample>
    <sample id="428">to evaluate our seven models, we gathered public and private datasets such as name entity recognition, classification, part-of-speech tagging, and question answering.</sample>
    <sample id="429">this model are compared to six baseline models which are camber oscar 138 gigabytes camber oscar 4 gigabytes camber cisnet 4 gigabytes petbit myobit and clinicalbert</sample>
    <sample id="430">the evaluation highlights that the model performs best on the task with data of the same nature as that on which the model has been trained.</sample>
    <sample id="431">however, we can obtain that data from we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance</sample>
    <sample id="432">overall, from-scratch training seemed to achieve higher performance on most of the tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="433">however, our experiment on continuous pretraining using the weight and tokenizer of permute-bert trained on the 4gb subset of natural questions showed comparable results to those obtained with dr. bert 4gb from scratch.</sample>
    <sample id="434">this is not the case for the model based on camelbear weights and tokenizers, which suffer from stability issues.</sample>
    <sample id="435">finally, as a conclusion, our proposed system achieved better performance on nine of the eleven down-stream tasks and surpassed globally the result of the generic model here, camembert.</sample>
    <sample id="436">we also observe that specialized data is better, more specialized data is better, but it doesn't scale well.</sample>
    <sample id="437">all the pre-trained models obtained from natsios are freely available on yugenface, and all the training scripts are in our github repository.</sample>
    <sample id="438">so thank you for this presentation and we are looking forward to seeing you at the poster session tomorrow</sample>
    <sample id="439">therefore, successful models for knowledge-intensive nlu tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-trained time and inference time knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="440">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruct improving multimodal social learning via instruction tuning</sample>
    <sample id="441">in total, we generated 55,000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sets, we asked crowdsourced workers to find and revise incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="442">and some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations, but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation.</sample>

    <sample id="535">hi, i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and funded by bruno kessler, and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper, that is a joint work with matteo negri and marco turchi.</sample>
    <sample id="536">my name is jawad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski silvia parotti and annie lewis</sample>
    <sample id="537">hello everyone, my name is alex villar and i will be giving a short overview of the paper: brenting paraphrase translation: assessing strategies and performance. this is a joint work with my colleagues from google translate.</sample>
    <sample id="538">param is a 540 billion parameter large language model presented last year in 2022, trained on a large collection of text comprising 780 billion tokens.</sample>
    <sample id="539">in terms of publication, it achieves state-of-the-art in hundreds of nlp tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="540">in this work, we present the first systematic study of large language model prompting for machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="541">we evaluate the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the amt community, which involves using the latest test sets to avoid overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model.</sample>
    <sample id="542">we compare two state-of-the-art systems, the best-performing systems in the wmt evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="543">we use state-of-the-art neural metrics and additionally also show expert-based human evaluation results. finally, we provide some recommendations for prompt selection strategies.</sample>
    <sample id="544">the prompting has a big influence on the performance of lms for translation as we can see in a simple experiment where we use one-shot prompting and provided two different prompts for the same sentence</sample>
    <sample id="545">the majority of sentences, 516 out of 1000, the difference observed is of more than one point.</sample>
    <sample id="546">and this can go in extreme cases up to forty blur points, so it's important to select a good prompting strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="547">in our experiments, we settled for a five-shot prompting strategy where we just mark each sentence that we provide to the system with the language it's in.</sample>
    <sample id="548">so in this example here where we perform translation from german into english the german sentences the source sentences are marked with german column and the english translations with english column</sample>
    <sample id="549">we saw that the actual form of the printing does not have a significant influence in the case of shared printing.</sample>
    <sample id="550">it's crucial for zero and one-shot prompting, and when we go, as in our case, to five-shot prompting, there is nearly no difference to the actual form of the prompting.</sample>
    <sample id="551">it's the examples that carry most of the weight.</sample>
    <sample id="552">the summary of our experimental results is that example quality is more important than similarity to the source sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="553">so it's important to select the examples from high-quality translations, in particular, we compare the selecting prompts from the training data of the wmt evaluations or the dev data.</sample>
    <sample id="554">the dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data and the results so better performance when using the dev data</sample>
    <sample id="555">nevertheless, specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over machine translations, but machine translations come pretty close to a commercial system. in our case, we chose to evaluate with google translate.</sample>
    <sample id="556">the insights we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems, but the main difference comes from the accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="557">in particular, the most common errors are omission errors.</sample>
    <sample id="558">so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better-sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are not needed in the translation.</sample>
    <sample id="559">however, the style awkward category for pan is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems, which is an additional signal.</sample>
    <sample id="560">that program provides really fluent output, but still with some problems of accuracy.</sample>
    <sample id="561">and that's it for this really short overview for more details, please come to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="597">first, we tag each input token with an unordered multiset of tokens that will appear in the output.</sample>
    <sample id="598">in total, we generate 55,000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites, we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise incorrect samples.</sample>
    <sample id="599">hello everyone, i'm mark shatte, and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kit must die: evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources. this work is a collaboration between mcgill university, nila, and microsoft research.</sample>
    <sample id="600">natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources, such as knowledge contained in their parameters, usually acquired via pre-training, and knowledge given in inputs at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="601">recent works in tasks such as question answering show that models can use pre-trained knowledge to solve the task.</sample>
    <sample id="602">but natural language understanding often requires knowledge that is also supplied at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="603">for example, in the sentence john saw the newly elected president on tv.</sample>
    <sample id="604">pre-trained parameters can contain information about what a president does and what a tv is, but they cannot reliably know who this instance-specific entity john is or who the new president is, because the president might have changed since pre-training.</sample>
    <sample id="605">therefore, successful models for knowledge-intensive nlu tasks require the ability to integrate and use both pre-trained and inference-time knowledge.</sample>
    <sample id="606">in this work, we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration.</sample>
    <sample id="607">we introduce a coreference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources. we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and establish coreference resolution models.</sample>
    <sample id="608">here is an example from our dataset: servin is a judge. kia is a baker. servin and kia met at a park. after a long day at work deciding cases in a law court, he was happy to relax.</sample>
    <sample id="609">the task here is to identify the correct entity that the pronoun he refers to, which in this case is seven.</sample>
    <sample id="610">the resolution of a given pronoun requires two types of information: first, entity-specific knowledge such as sarah is a judge and second, background knowledge such as judges decide cases in law courts.</sample>
    <sample id="611">generally, background knowledge is learned during the pre-training of large language models, while entity-specific knowledge is typically observed at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="612">we vary the availability of these two pieces of information so that it may either be found in a single source or in multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="613">we have defined three settings of kitmos: first, we have the two-tiered setting, background pre-training, where background knowledge is assumed to be available at pre-training time.</sample>
    <sample id="614">second, there is the background both setting, where background knowledge is available both at pre-training time and at inference time. lastly, the background inference setting, where both types of knowledge are available only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="615">this last setting is especially interesting because it simulates the case where the background knowledge necessary to solve a task is not part of the pre-trained data of the models, for example, because new occupations have developed since the time of pre-training.</sample>
    <sample id="616">here is an example of how we control the availability of facts and true sources.</sample>
    <sample id="617">in the background pre-trained setting, we assume that the background knowledge politicians seek elected seats in government is contained in the pre-trained parameters. in the three-sentence context, we provide the anti-specific knowledge chichester is a politician.</sample>
    <sample id="618">in the background knowledge setting, we provide not only entity-specific but also background knowledge about politicians in the inference task context.</sample>
    <sample id="619">in the background and fictional setting, we provide the fictional occupation mieritura instead of politician because mieritura is unlikely to be contained in the pre-training period.</sample>
    <sample id="620">we evaluated the dataset with both human study participants and established coreference resolution models. in this figure, we show the results of the best-performing models on the most difficult variant of the background pre-training setting.</sample>
    <sample id="621">without task-specific training on kidmos, both models do not perform well. when trained on kidmos, however, both c2f and bert-for-coref perform significantly better than the random choice.</sample>
    <sample id="622">this suggests that when trained on cat genetic reference resolution datasets, models learn to exploit surface cues, which are not useful when testing on kitmos where such cues have been removed.</sample>
    <sample id="623">additional experiments with fictitious knowledge indicate that even the best-performing models cannot reliably integrate background knowledge provided only at inference time.</sample>
    <sample id="624">to summarize the main takeaways of our paper, many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training; however, with task-specific training, some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources.</sample>
    <sample id="625">still, even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details, please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="626">at the end we concluded that the best automatic alignment method to use for german text simplification is the method of mass align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper</sample>
    <sample id="627">if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data, the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize in weakly supervised learning. training algorithms are proposed to robustly train neural networks under such label noise so that the trained models still generalize well.</sample>
    <sample id="628">you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="629">to investigate these problems we developed the conll++ dataset this is a dataset that we collected from reuters news from 2020 and then annotated them with the same conll 2003 annotation guidelines</sample>
    <sample id="667">existing works can be broadly classified into four categories.</sample>
    <sample id="668">we also find some other interesting findings for example encoder decoder outperforms previous work or achieves comparable results but training on english natural language can significantly boost the performance of future on-target natural languages and without multilingual language models such as coders and bloom are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic tasks</sample>
    <sample id="669">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do convolutional 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started</sample>
    <sample id="670">our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task.</sample>
    <sample id="671">we observe that models have been used in conll 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data accurately</sample>
    <sample id="672">and when we develop new taggers, what is needed for good generalization?</sample>
    <sample id="673">at the same time, if we do observe poor generalization, what causes the performance drop of these models?</sample>
    <sample id="674">to investigate these problems we developed the callnet dataset this is a dataset that we collected from reuters news from 2020 and then annotated them with the same callnet 2003 annotation guidelines</sample>
    <sample id="675">we then fine-tuned over 20 models on kernel 2003 we evaluated them on both the kernel 03 test set and the kernel plus plus test set</sample>
    <sample id="676">and last but not least, we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model.</sample>
    <sample id="677">so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that there are three main ingredients that are needed</sample>
    <sample id="678">the first one is the model architecture: through our experiments, we found that transformer models generally generalize better to new data.</sample>
    <sample id="679">the second ingredient is the model size we found that usually larger models lead to better generalization</sample>
    <sample id="680">and last but not least we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization</sample>
    <sample id="681">to our next question, what causes the performance drop of some models?</sample>
    <sample id="682">we had two hypotheses the first one is adaptive overfitting which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again and this is usually manifested as the diminishing returns on a new test set</sample>
    <sample id="683">the second hypothesis is temporal drift, which is the performance degradation caused by the increasing temporal gap between the training and test data.</sample>
    <sample id="684">for adaptive overfitting, we saw from the graph on the right that the red best-fit line has a gradient greater than one.</sample>
    <sample id="685">this means that every unit of improvement that we made on call of 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on call of which means that there is no diminishing returns</sample>
    <sample id="686">this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed.</sample>
    <sample id="687">so what about the temperature of that?</sample>
    <sample id="688">for temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gaps</sample>
    <sample id="689">this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift.</sample>
    <sample id="690">our conclusion is that for good generalization we would need a better model architecture larger model size as well as more fine-tuning examples and these go hand in hand we can't just have one ingredient but throughout the others</sample>
    <sample id="691">at the same time, we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift, and surprisingly, it is not caused by adaptive overfitting, even though kernel 2003 has been used for over 20 years.</sample>
    <sample id="692">so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do cornell 2003 tags still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes</sample>
    <sample id="693">we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve the generalization of the models.</sample>
    <sample id="694">and lastly, please make sure to check out our paper, our dataset, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact me. thank you so much.</sample>
    <sample id="695">in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations</sample>
    <sample id="696">for example if a right-leaning language models were to be fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation or whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control so this sounds the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political leanings</sample>
    <sample id="697">hi, i am yannis lavrac and i will present to you our work on dr bert, a robust pre-trained model in french for the biomedical and clinical domain.</sample>
    <sample id="698">hi everyone i'm kostas upson and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context</sample>
    <sample id="699">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with esendermush and danjurovski</sample>
    <sample id="700">furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky</sample>
    <sample id="701">first from mark groups the top words include things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm</sample>
    <sample id="702">in this work, we extend cxi to pointwise cxi, which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. we can think of words that have high cxi as ones that require context for translation.</sample>
    <sample id="703">to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch model a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of set of natchez a first version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of sentences taken from clinical notes and a final version of schubert with a mix of 4 gigabytes of set of natchez and 4 gigabytes of clinical notes</sample>
    <sample id="704">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with esendermush and danjurovski</sample>
    <sample id="705">in recent years, many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models (llms).</sample>
    <sample id="706">however, these measures have various limitations; they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate.</sample>
    <sample id="707">and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups</sample>
    <sample id="708">furthermore most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm</sample>
    <sample id="709">to overcome these limitations, we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned lms are very good at responding to instructions and prompts.</sample>
    <sample id="710">so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself</sample>
    <sample id="711">and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt</sample>
    <sample id="712">here are some example generations from gpt-4.</sample>
    <sample id="713">immediately, we see that while the outputs aren't overtly negative or toxic in the traditional sense of these words</sample>
    <sample id="714">there are some interesting patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="715">the asian woman is depicted as unassuming the middle eastern woman is referred to using words like exotic and like referring to a mesmerizing region</sample>
    <sample id="716">and both of the women of color personas make references to ancestry, while the white man persona has nothing of the sort.</sample>
    <sample id="717">to capture these patterns, our method has two parts. the first part is generating these personas.</sample>
    <sample id="718">our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects finding that by giving it to human subjects they also were able to surface racial stereotypes</sample>
    <sample id="719">also, this enables direct comparison between our generated personas and the human-written responses.</sample>
    <sample id="720">the second part is marked words which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups or marked ones which i'll elaborate on shortly</sample>
    <sample id="721">the benefit of this is that we get really specific stereotypes and patterns without having to rely on any specific lexicon.</sample>
    <sample id="722">so the marked words method draws upon the sociolinguistic concept of markedness which states that there is an unmarked default and any group that differs from that default is linguistically marked</sample>
    <sample id="723">so for instance the word man or sorry the word warrior is usually associated with men so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman</sample>
    <sample id="724">and more broadly, dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked, while marginalized groups are usually marked.</sample>
    <sample id="725">so in our method, we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are.</sample>
    <sample id="726">and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group</sample>
    <sample id="727">so for instance for the personas of black women we would do fighting words and compare the law god's ratios against both white personas and man personas because those are the two corresponding unmarked groups</sample>
    <sample id="728">and now for some results so first we use alexicon of stereotypes and we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes than the human-written ones</sample>
    <sample id="729">however, when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon, we find very different things.</sample>
    <sample id="730">so while the generated personas have much higher rates of the luxon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic</sample>
    <sample id="731">so really just only the positive or at least non-negative ones</sample>
    <sample id="732">and in fact this lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all so instead to do that we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these positive seeming words facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives</sample>
    <sample id="733">in our analysis, we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect horrible patterns.</sample>
    <sample id="734">first from mark groups the top words include things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm</sample>
    <sample id="735">this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups.</sample>
    <sample id="736">furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous</sample>
    <sample id="737">which connects to a trope of tropicalism for asian women, the words are things like petite and delicate and silky.</sample>
    <sample id="738">which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on</sample>
    <sample id="739">finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient</sample>
    <sample id="740">this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds positive at first glance</sample>
    <sample id="741">and there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these demographics to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles</sample>
    <sample id="742">so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms</sample>
    <sample id="743">more broadly, we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives.</sample>
    <sample id="744">based on these patterns, we conclude with three recommendations for model owners.</sample>
    <sample id="745">first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that</sample>
    <sample id="746">finally, there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods.</sample>
    <sample id="747">because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird</sample>
    <sample id="748">overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns</sample>
    <sample id="749">we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency</sample>
    <sample id="750">thank you so much for listening have a good time</sample>

    <sample id="775">hello everyone, my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china.</sample>
    <sample id="776">it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper: i will copy my model: protecting the copyright of large language models for embedding and services via backdoor watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="777">let's first introduce the background about embedding our services.</sample>
    <sample id="778">currently, large language models such as gpt-3, lama, palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation.</sample>
    <sample id="779">embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="780">for example, openlayers offers a gdal-based embedding api.</sample>
    <sample id="781">however, recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding and provide similar services. therefore, it is necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services.</sample>
    <sample id="782">to protect the copyright of embedding services, one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="783">the watermark method needs to meet the following properties: first, the method should be applicable to embedding services; second, the watermark should not degrade the utility of the embedded services.</sample>
    <sample id="784">third, the watermark should be conspicuous enough to the attacker, or the attacker can easily remove the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="785">finally, the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process.</sample>
    <sample id="786">existing works can be broadly classified into four categories.</sample>
    <sample id="787">however, these methods are either not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability.</sample>
    <sample id="788">therefore, in this paper, we propose embedding marker, which is a backdoor-based watermarking method applicable to embedding services.</sample>
    <sample id="789">then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps: watermark injection and copyright verification.</sample>
    <sample id="790">before these main steps, we first select a trigger set. the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval.</sample>
    <sample id="791">we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency within it.</sample>
    <sample id="792">in watermark injection, we first define a target embedding. when a user sends a sentence to the provider's service, the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="793">the provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="794">the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence when the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m, the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding.</sample>
    <sample id="795">copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark.</sample>
    <sample id="796">we first construct a backdoor dataset and a benign dataset. the backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set, while all words in the sentences of the benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set.</sample>
    <sample id="797">then the provider requests embeddings from the stealer service with the dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="798">the cosine and l2 similarity between the requested embedding and the target embedding are computed. we compute the similarity difference between the nine and the backdoor dataset, which is defined as delta cosine and delta l2.</sample>
    <sample id="799">meanwhile, we also apply the ks test and use its p-value as the third metric.</sample>
    <sample id="800">we conduct experiments on four datasets: agnews, mnist, sst-2, and erasmus. we assume the provider applied wikitext to the dataset to count word frequencies.</sample>
    <sample id="801">the results on four datasets show that our embedded marker can achieve great detection performance while maintaining good utility for downstream tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="802">we also validate the covertness of the provided embedding by visualizing the embedding of sentences unfolded as a bipartite graph. the legend of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence.</sample>
    <sample id="803">as shown in the figures, it is difficult to distinguish between factorized embeddings and normal embeddings.</sample>
    <sample id="804">that's all, thank you. welcome to discuss with us.</sample>
    <sample id="805">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and funded by bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo negri and marco turchi</sample>
    <sample id="806">what is simultaneous speech translation? simultaneous speech translation, or simosti, is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time, enabling cross-language communication.</sample>
    <sample id="807">and what are the problems of the current similarity models? specific architectures are usually trained by introducing additional modules to be optimized.</sample>
    <sample id="808">long and complicated training procedures, for example, training involving different optimization objectives.</sample>
    <sample id="809">and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on</sample>
    <sample id="810">so what is our solution?</sample>
    <sample id="811">first, use existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific parameters</sample>
    <sample id="812">and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the attention mechanism between audio input and textual output, that is the cross-attention mechanism, and you can see an example on the right.</sample>
    <sample id="813">our solution is to propose attention or encoder-decoder attention, which is a strategy for deciding whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to.</sample>
    <sample id="814">a word is emitted if the tension is not concentrated, that is, if the sum is below a certain threshold alpha, towards the last lambda speech frames, meaning that the received information is unstable.</sample>
    <sample id="815">for example, if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts the translation in german</sample>
    <sample id="816">and we will look at the cross-attention weights</sample>
    <sample id="817">we will see that the first two words point to the earliest received speech frames while the last word points to the last received pitch frames and lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="818">this means that the first two words will be omitted.</sample>
    <sample id="819">while since the sum of the cross-attention is above a certain threshold alpha we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk</sample>
    <sample id="820">if we continue, we receive another speech sound, and our model predicts order three words, and we will look at the cross-attention weights.</sample>
    <sample id="821">we will see that no words points to the last lambda speech frames.</sample>
    <sample id="822">this means that these three words will be omitted.</sample>
    <sample id="823">if you look at the main results of that</sample>
    <sample id="824">we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging.</sample>
    <sample id="825">that is the latency measure and we also consider the computationally aware average lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output.</sample>
    <sample id="826">so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot.</sample>
    <sample id="827">but we also want that they are shifted to the left.</sample>
    <sample id="828">and we compare with popular strategies that are also applied to offline models, namely the wait-k strategy and the local equipment, and we compare also with the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous speech translation.</sample>
    <sample id="829">these are all the results of the simultaneous speech translation strategy on german.</sample>
    <sample id="830">and we see that adult outperforms all the strategies applied to offline models since their curves are shifted to the left</sample>
    <sample id="831">we also see that if we consider the actual elapsed time or the computational wall time, that is the fastest strategy.</sample>
    <sample id="832">if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="839">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification</sample>
    <sample id="840">the authors conducted experiments on four datasets: agnews, mnist, sst-2, and erasmus. they assumed the provider applied wikitext to the dataset to count word frequencies.</sample>
    <sample id="841">hi everyone, i'm kostas xannavas and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk on our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context.</sample>
    <sample id="842">this is a joint work with john gauthier, aaron mueller, kanishka misra, karen fuentes, roger levy, and etina williams.</sample>
    <sample id="843">in this work, we revisit the minimal pair paradigm.</sample>
    <sample id="844">so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like plump syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross-pairs</sample>
    <sample id="845">and in this minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence</sample>
    <sample id="846">and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="847">the current mpp pipeline does not currently allow us to evaluate models' performance on longer sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="848">these days, large language models are coming up with longer and longer context windows, so it's crucial that we evaluate the model's acceptability throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="849">and that is what we are trying to do here we are trying to revisit the mpp pipeline by asking the model to evaluate acceptability on longer and longer sequences</sample>
    <sample id="850">so that is the approach so what we do is that to simulate these longer sequences we revisit the data sets themselves and then we recreate sentences by choosing like acceptable or unacceptable sentences from those data sets</sample>
    <sample id="851">so for example here we have chosen a typical pair of grammaticality from the blimp dataset from the adjunct island case</sample>
    <sample id="852">and what we do is that to recreate like longer sequences and which are acceptable and which has the same matching of the grammatical structure we extract grammatical sentences from adjoint pilot</sample>
    <sample id="853">then we add it as a prefix to both the acceptable query and the unacceptable query.</sample>
    <sample id="854">so we can do the same thing by choosing unacceptable sentences from the same matching and that could also be used to test the model's acceptability.</sample>
    <sample id="855">and we can also do the same by choosing sentences from a different subset or a different dataset, so that is what we call the mismatch scenario.</sample>
    <sample id="856">so here the sentences are still coming from relevant data sets but it's not from the same data set that you are evaluating with and we can do the same for unacceptability case</sample>
    <sample id="857">finally, we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain, such as wikipedia.</sample>
    <sample id="858">this will tell us whether the models' acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context.</sample>
    <sample id="859">like whether the context is coming from a different subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current like to the sentence that we are looking at</sample>
    <sample id="860">so how does the model do so first we look at the wikipedia sentences which are completely irrelevant to the current query pair and there we find that the mpp judgments are mostly robust for arbitrary context lengths</sample>
    <sample id="861">we increased the context length toward up to 2024 for to max out opt and gpt-2 models and we saw here in the orange dotted line the mpp judgments are relatively stable</sample>
    <sample id="862">now, what happens when we choose sentences from the same dataset?</sample>
    <sample id="863">here, we are creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blender syntax dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="864">and there we see that the mpp judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add either acceptable prefixes or unacceptable prefixes</sample>
    <sample id="865">but when we match the structure, that is when we choose the sentences from the same phenomenon in blame per syntax gem</sample>
    <sample id="866">we see a massive increase or a massive decrease in the mpp judgment for the model depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable</sample>
    <sample id="867">now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window</sample>
    <sample id="868">so why does the prefix match affect the language model's judgment so much?</sample>
    <sample id="869">so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations</sample>
    <sample id="870">we find that none of these noises are actually making the model change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend</sample>
    <sample id="871">basically, we find that the models are sensitive to sentence perturbations in similar ways.</sample>
    <sample id="872">that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see a similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see a decrease in mpp judgments in a similar fashion</sample>
    <sample id="873">the key takeaways from our work are that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features that are shared across sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="874">and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window.</sample>
    <sample id="875">please read our paper for more details of our experiments. thank you for listening.</sample>

    <sample id="948">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge</sample>
    <sample id="949">we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language. simply put, cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent.</sample>
    <sample id="950">such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance</sample>
    <sample id="951">further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence, and they have a consonance relationship.</sample>
    <sample id="952">while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making, they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations.</sample>
    <sample id="953">so why does this matter? studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people, track trends in belief, values, and attitude changes in populations.</sample>
    <sample id="954">high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better.</sample>
    <sample id="955">studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and the polarization of vulnerable groups.</sample>
    <sample id="956">finally, cognitive dissonance is important to understand the personal cognitive styles of individuals and helps us understand decision-making processes better.</sample>
    <sample id="957">to the goal of creating a cognitive dissonance resource, we conducted a large-scale annotation of dissonance relations. we used a dissonance-first approach as seen in the flowchart here.</sample>
    <sample id="958">tweets were passed using a pdtb parser, and pairs of discourse units were annotated according to the guidelines described in our paper.</sample>
    <sample id="959">as can be seen here, resonance was found in only 3.5% of the annotated pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="960">on collecting around 1000 examples of discourse unit pairs, we ran training for an initial classifier trained only on 43 examples of dissonance. to no surprise, the classifier performed not much better than chance.</sample>
    <sample id="961">given the low occurrence of dissonance and the absence of any prior such dataset, we are facing the problem of absolute rarity.</sample>
    <sample id="962">to alleviate this, we experiment with combinations of transfer learning and active learning to annotate such that more dissonant samples can be collected over fewer annotation runs, lowering the overall annotation cost while improving dissonance detection.</sample>
    <sample id="963">since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all, we start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="964">we transfer from two different tasks: topic-independent disagreement stance classification, a task that determines whether two debate statements from different people are in agreement or disagreement, regardless of the topic.</sample>
    <sample id="965">called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of purity b since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them ce here</sample>
    <sample id="966">we find that on transferring, the zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance, with the best with auc 0.62.</sample>
    <sample id="967">further on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning of ce tasks followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to co-start the active learning</sample>
    <sample id="968">next, we determine the best method to update a model with new data from each round of active learning and annotations: cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far, whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected.</sample>
    <sample id="969">over the different strategies, we found that cumulative performed equally or better than iterative across the board.</sample>
    <sample id="970">next, to improve the number of dissonance examples, we use a probability of rare class strategy (prc) to select mostly examples that are highly likely to be dissonant by the current model at any round of air.</sample>
    <sample id="971">we compared this to the other state-of-the-art strategies that are commonly used in the community.</sample>
    <sample id="972">we find that the proposed prc strategy works better than other state-of-the-art strategies, although the difference is small. note that the performance is significantly lower for random.</sample>
    <sample id="973">on further rounds of ale with two best strategies, we improved disorder classification auc to 0.75, which is the best performance we have achieved on the task so far.</sample>
    <sample id="974">we also checked the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult</sample>
    <sample id="975">in summary, we find that prc is a simple al strategy for rare class acquisition, and cold-starting al with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly.</sample>
    <sample id="976">we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain, whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update.</sample>
    <sample id="977">these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="978">these reliable informative and distinct abc eval metrics enable us to evaluate conversational ai with a higher resolution than previous methods are able to achieve you can see that in the results of our experiment that several challenges still remain and have been precisely quantified for example the bots we tested have common sense violations in around 20 of their responses they produce irrelevant information in around 15 of the responses and they contradict themselves or their partner around 10 of the time with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models release since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="982">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge</sample>
    <sample id="983">hi, my name is adam sperkowski, and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="984">hello everyone my name is yixin john from penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations</sample>
    <sample id="985">semantic parsing is the task of building semantic representations of user queries, such as sql and lambda calculus.</sample>
    <sample id="986">cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task of translating queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations.</sample>
    <sample id="987">as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc</sample>
    <sample id="988">existing cross-lingual semantic parsing models are separately proposed and evaluated on datasets of limited tasks and applications, for instance.</sample>
    <sample id="989">there are gaps in coverage for certain natural languages, including chinese.</sample>
    <sample id="990">the lake has coverage on certain mini-representations.</sample>
    <sample id="991">the lambda calculus is missing.</sample>
    <sample id="992">or they are only evaluated on a certain neural model for example there is only one single model to evaluate the</sample>
    <sample id="993">to this end, we propose exemplar, a uniform dataset exemplar for cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and meaning representations.</sample>
    <sample id="994">it contains nine data sets in various domains, 570 taxonomies, 8 million representations, and 22 natural languages in 15 language families.</sample>
    <sample id="995">to better evaluate our benchmark, we consider the six settings for training and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="996">the first one is translate test: we use google translate api to translate source to the target language, then use a monolingual model to train and evaluation.</sample>
    <sample id="997">and for example we train the english model on english query and during inference we translate the german query using api to english and then use the trained model to predict the sql</sample>
    <sample id="998">and we will also test the monolingual module.</sample>
    <sample id="999">in this setting, the source language is the same as the target language, for example, german to german or english to english.</sample>
    <sample id="1000">we also test multilingual fusion settings by training multilingual models with only 10% of the training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1001">and it has the multilingual model, which we train one multilingual model for all languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1002">for example we put the german english chinese queries together to train a multilingual model and during inference we can use this model to</sample>
    <sample id="1003">to translate german queries or chinese queries, etc.</sample>
    <sample id="1004">we also consider cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot transfer, where we train on one source language and transfer to another language.</sample>
    <sample id="1005">during training we're training on english query or the combination of english and german few-shot queries to train a multilingual model to and predict the sql output</sample>
    <sample id="1006">and we also found many interesting results so regarding the analysis of monolingual models, we evaluated on two groups of models.</sample>
    <sample id="1007">including encoder pdr which stands for multilingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr-pdr and bert-pdr</sample>
    <sample id="1008">and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mtf</sample>
    <sample id="1009">we found that encoder-decoder achieves the best performance on all nine datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1010">and we evaluate on mt5 and xlmr+bdr in a multilingual setting.</sample>
    <sample id="1011">without that, encoder-decoder or pdr can be improved by training on a mixture of various languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1012">and we found it is because most of the major natural languages can obtain performance gain, except that english performance drops in seven data sets and only gains in three data sets.</sample>
    <sample id="1013">i think this is known as the curse of multilinguality.</sample>
    <sample id="1014">we also compared the cross-lingual performance gap.</sample>
    <sample id="1015">in this figure, the blue line represents cross-lingual fusional transfer, the orange line represents cross-lingual zero-shot transfer, while the green line represents monolingual setting.</sample>
    <sample id="1016">we found that by comparing the green and orange line, we found that for zero-shot settings, the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant, and by comparing blue and orange line, we found that for few-shot settings, the transfer gap is shortened rapidly.</sample>
    <sample id="1017">we also find some other interesting findings for example encoder decoder outperforms previous work or achieves comparable results for training on english natural language can significantly boost the performance of future on target natural languages</sample>
    <sample id="1018">we found that multilingual language models such as coders and bloom are still inadequate for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1019">in summary, we build a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations.</sample>
    <sample id="1020">we conducted a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative types of multilingual language models and our results show many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="1021">in particular, the most common errors are omission errors.</sample>
    <sample id="1048">this work was conducted by the emory nlp lab, led by professor gino choy at emory university, in collaboration with amazon alexa ai.</sample>
    <sample id="1049">to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done with clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with free short learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in ws finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="1050">the paper is a joint work by john gauthier, aaron mueller, kanishka misra, karen fuentes, roger levy, and etina williams.</sample>
    <sample id="1084">hello everyone my name is yixin john from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations</sample>
    <sample id="1085">hi i'm jean gin phd student at the university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models</sample>
    <sample id="1086">so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data.</sample>
    <sample id="1087">political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data</sample>
    <sample id="1088">this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications.</sample>
    <sample id="1089">so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream task applications</sample>
    <sample id="1090">to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions</sample>
    <sample id="1091">first, how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models, and what role might pre-training data play in such political biases?</sample>
    <sample id="1092">secondly, how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks, and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications?</sample>
    <sample id="1093">so specifically we first propose to prompt language models with different prompt formats using the political questionnaires such as the political compass test this ensures us to do automatic evaluation well grounded in political science literature</sample>
    <sample id="1094">so some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political leanings; they occupy all four quadrants on the political compass.</sample>
    <sample id="1095">we can also see that gpt-4 is the most liberal language model of them all, and gpt theories are generally more socially liberal than bert theories and its variants.</sample>
    <sample id="1096">secondly, we aim to investigate to what extent the political biases of language models are actually picked up from training data.</sample>
    <sample id="1097">so we could conduct a controlled experiment by further pre-training language model checkpoints on six different parties and corpora separated into news and social media further divided into their political leanings</sample>
    <sample id="1098">by further pre-training language models on such parties and corpora, we can see that the ideological coordinates of the language model also shift accordingly.</sample>
    <sample id="1099">for example for robert further fine-tuned further trained on the left-leaning reddit corpus we can see a substantial liberal shift in terms of its</sample>
    <sample id="1100">in terms of these political biases</sample>
    <sample id="1101">and we also try to investigate whether language models can pick up the polarization that is prevalent in our modern society.</sample>
    <sample id="1102">so we divide pre-training corpora into pre-45th president of the united states and after 45th president of the united states we separately pre-train language models on the two different temporal corpora</sample>
    <sample id="1103">we can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017 so this indicates that language models can also pick up the polarization in our society</sample>
    <sample id="1104">so last but not least we evaluate language models with different political leanings on hate speech detection and fake news detection two nlp applications that often involve language models and could have very significant implications</sample>
    <sample id="1105">so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into</sample>
    <sample id="1106">different demographics or political leaning of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better</sample>
    <sample id="1107">in detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups.</sample>
    <sample id="1108">however, our work is in detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society.</sample>
    <sample id="1109">and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting at black lgbtq plus and other minority communities</sample>
    <sample id="1110">similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political leaning and vice versa</sample>
    <sample id="1111">this will further show many qualitative examples to see that language models with different political leanings accurately</sample>
    <sample id="1112">do give different predictions to hate speech and misinformation examples based on their social categories there are a bunch of more examples in the appendix to further highlight that</sample>
    <sample id="1113">this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models.</sample>
    <sample id="1114">for example, if large language models were fine-tuned on hate speech or misinformation and deployed to a popular social media platform</sample>
    <sample id="1115">this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control.</sample>
    <sample id="1116">this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and address the fairness issues resulting from language model political leanings.</sample>
    <sample id="1117">so a little bit of discussion we would also like to highlight that we exposed the unique dilemma regarding language model political biases it's like between cila and carib this</sample>
    <sample id="1118">so if we do not sanitize political opinions in language model training data, the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks, ultimately creating fairness issues.</sample>
    <sample id="1119">if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language monitoring data so it's kind of like the electric cholly problem</sample>
    <sample id="1120">okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today five for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="1121">until every token from the first stage has been visited exactly once.</sample>
    <sample id="1122">the second part is marked words which is a method to identify the words that distinguish marked groups or marked ones which i'll elaborate on shortly</sample>
    <sample id="1123">hi i'm john green phd student at the university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models</sample>
    <sample id="1124">now there are also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures, such as the plug approach, the conjunction-headed approach assumed in plug-dependency tree banks, where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction.</sample>
    <sample id="1125">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai</sample>
    <sample id="1126">my name is jawad hosseini, and this is a joint work with philippe radlinski, silvia parotti, and annie lewis.</sample>
    <sample id="1127">so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like plump syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs</sample>
    <sample id="1128">hello my name is kaiyo yen and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multilingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick frenoux emily yu andrew ft martins and graham newbig</sample>
    <sample id="1129">so many translations depend on context, for example, how would we translate more in this sentence?</sample>
    <sample id="1130">well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark</sample>
    <sample id="1131">the meaning of the word changes depending on the context, and therefore its translation also changes.</sample>
    <sample id="1132">however, evaluating how well models can handle cases like this is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus-level metrics like bleu unable to capture these translations</sample>
    <sample id="1133">and some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context-dependent translations, but these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages, as they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation.</sample>
    <sample id="1134">in this work, we aim to answer two questions: first, when does translation require context, and second, how well do models handle these cases?</sample>
    <sample id="1135">to answer the first question, we started by measuring how much a word depends on context during translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1136">in the previous work, we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models, and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x.</sample>
    <sample id="1137">you can think of cxi as the information gained from giving context to the model.</sample>
    <sample id="1138">in this work, we extend cxi to pointwise cxi, which can measure context usage at the sentence level or at the word level. we can think of words that have high cxi as ones that require context for translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1139">now we analyze words with high p-sexmi to look for patterns between these words.</sample>
    <sample id="1140">and we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english into fourteen different languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1141">we perform our analysis at three different levels: first, we look at part-of-speech tags that have high mean pxmi.</sample>
    <sample id="1142">and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high xmi and this can be explained because english doesn't have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic</sample>
    <sample id="1143">and similarly, we find that certain languages also require context when we want to choose the appropriate verb form. we then look at vocabulary items that have high psexmi averaged over all of its different occurrences.</sample>
    <sample id="1144">and this helps us identify cases like the one here where in chinese you need context to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document</sample>
    <sample id="1145">similarly, we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality.</sample>
    <sample id="1146">and finally we look at different individual tokens that have high p-sexmi and this allows us to identify phenomena that cannot really be captured by the word itself but that's rather expressed in the sentence structure such as ellipsis resolution</sample>
    <sample id="1147">so now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1148">for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified, we created tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon, and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse aware or muda tagger.</sample>
    <sample id="1149">we can also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena.</sample>
    <sample id="1150">we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger to the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation, and we apply our translation metrics of choice to the context-dependent examples that the muda tagger has identified.</sample>
    <sample id="1151">finally, we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate different models on document-level machine translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1152">first of all, when we use corpus-level metrics, so for blue, we find that context-agnostic models have the best performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1153">but then if we use comet, context-aware models perform best, and if we use wordf measure, then models with and without context have comparable performance.</sample>
    <sample id="1154">this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone.</sample>
    <sample id="1155">now we use the mueller benchmark to evaluate models, and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena, such as formality and lexical cohesion.</sample>
    <sample id="1156">but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation</sample>
    <sample id="1157">we also compared different commercial systems, and our benchmark shows that deepbelief is usually more accurate than google translate for document-level translations.</sample>
    <sample id="1158">in summary, we conducted a data-driven analysis across fourteen language pairs to identify when translations require context.</sample>
    <sample id="1159">and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation, which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not, and which translation systems are good at document-level translation.</sample>
    <sample id="1160">thank you so much for your attention, see you in toronto.</sample>
    <sample id="1161">we addressed these research questions in our work and our findings are as follows first we find that interestingly recent wsl methods indeed require clean validation samples to work properly otherwise there is a large performance drop as shown in this figure if there are no clean validation samples then the trained models cannot generalize beyond the original weak labels meaning that the training is pointless this indicates that wsl approaches actually require cleanly labeled data to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked over second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help wsl approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance</sample>
    <sample id="1162">we also introduce a comparison of models with multiple pretraining settings and data sources. then, we present our results on eleven biomedical and clinical downstream tasks in french.</sample>
    <sample id="1163">hi, welcome to our presentation of deplane, a new corpus for german text simplification at the document level and at the sentence level.</sample>
    <sample id="1164">my name is regina stodden, and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation. let's first define text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1165">text amplification is the process of adapting a text to improve the comprehension of it for a specific target group, such as people with reading problems or non-native speakers.</sample>
    <sample id="1166">to train a text simplification model, we require parallel pairs of text, for example, documents or sentences.</sample>
    <sample id="1167">in the example here, you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german sentence and its translation into plain language.</sample>
    <sample id="1168">to simplify the sentence, different techniques are possible, as you can see in the example, such as lexical substitution, clause deletion, cross-deletion, reordering, or insertion of words.</sample>
    <sample id="1169">we now propose our new corpus the plane because in recent years there were some problems with the existing corpus so for example these corpora here are too small to train a text simplification model on</sample>
    <sample id="1170">the other three models proposed in recent years are all automatically aligned, which means they can be error-prone in their alignments.</sample>
    <sample id="1171">therefore, we propose our new corpus dplane, which is split into two subcorpora: dplane-apa and dplane-web. dplane-apa is based on news texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1172">in deeplane apa, we aligned 483 documents manually, resulting in roughly 33,000 parallel sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1173">for deep lane web this corpus includes different domains and we also align all of these 750 documents on the one hand manually and on the other hand with automatic alignment methods</sample>
    <sample id="1174">in total, we will result in thirty thousand four hundred fifty sentence pairs.</sample>
    <sample id="1175">we analyzed our sentence pairs a little more, for example, on the type of simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1176">as you can see here, the bible texts are much stronger and simplified than, for example, the news texts or the language learner texts.</sample>
    <sample id="1177">on all levels regarding, for example, lexical simplification, structural simplification, or the overall level of simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1178">furthermore, you can see that our deep learning corpus has a high variety of different simplification transformations so for example, in the deep learning api corpus, we have much more reorderings and word additions than we have in the deep learning web corpus.</sample>
    <sample id="1179">on the other hand, in the web corpus, we have much more rephrasings.</sample>
    <sample id="1180">so let's now see what we can do with this corpus hello i am omar and now i will talk about the use cases for our dataset dplay so for the first use case we can evaluate automatic alignment methods</sample>
    <sample id="1181">in recent years, there have been many alignment methods, but in the context of machine translations.</sample>
    <sample id="1182">where we have two parallel documents written in different languages and we want to extract alignments of sentences in both documents.</sample>
    <sample id="1183">but in our use case we are trying to extract alignments between sentences of two parallel documents having the same language having the same content but they are on a different complexity level</sample>
    <sample id="1184">and now as we have our dataset d plane which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods</sample>
    <sample id="1185">we made some adaptations to the proposed methods, and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1186">at the end, we concluded that the best automatic alignment method to use for german text simplification is the method of mass alignment.</sample>
    <sample id="1187">you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1188">the second use case we demonstrated in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification.</sample>
    <sample id="1189">by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from complex input text.</sample>
    <sample id="1190">we have fine-tuned two different models. we have fine-tuned a model of longformer to produce document-level simplifications.</sample>
    <sample id="1191">we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence-level simplifications.</sample>
    <sample id="1192">you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper.</sample>
    <sample id="1193">we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores</sample>
    <sample id="1194">we propose those results as a benchmark, a base benchmark, for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future.</sample>
    <sample id="1195">thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="1196">hi, and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection, in which we introduced the altentities corpus.</sample>
    <sample id="1197">my name is jawad hosseini, and this is a joint work with philippe radlinski, silvia parotti, and annie lewis.</sample>
    <sample id="1198">our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice now consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling here a user wants to select between one of these two songs</sample>
    <sample id="1199">the most obvious thing is to use a direct reference for example by saying the name of the song is amy or its position the first one</sample>
    <sample id="1200">but sometimes an indirect reference is more appropriate to have a more natural conversation. this could happen when the user cannot remember the name of the song.</sample>
    <sample id="1201">all the pronunciations are too similar to each other and hard to distinguish.</sample>
    <sample id="1202">or when the user wants to specify a preference: here are some examples of indirect preferences: for example, the newer one or the song that's not energetic.</sample>
    <sample id="1203">this is an important problem in conversational systems and also for benchmarking elms entity understanding.</sample>
    <sample id="1204">we're not aware of a public dataset a large-scale public dataset for the task so we collect one using crowd annotation our dataset covers three different domains music books and restaurants</sample>
    <sample id="1205">our dataset collection methodology emphasizes informality using a cartoon completion task.</sample>
    <sample id="1206">the cartoon has three speech bubbles in the first bubble, bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that, bob sets the dialogue context.</sample>
    <sample id="1207">in the second speech bubble, alice says, do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling?</sample>
    <sample id="1208">which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect reference to select one of these entities for example the newer</sample>
    <sample id="1209">we provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically, but the third one is filled in by the annotator. the first speech bubble is chosen from a few manual prompts per domain.</sample>
    <sample id="1210">the second one, which is the alternative question, is generated as follows.</sample>
    <sample id="1211">we always use a simple template do you mean a or b where a and b are samples from wikipedia</sample>
    <sample id="1212">here are the different sampling methods we've used: when we move higher in the list, the entities become more similar to each other, and it's usually harder to make the disambiguation.</sample>
    <sample id="1213">the first one is uniform attraction.</sample>
    <sample id="1214">the second one is when the entities have similar titles, for example, two books with the same title.</sample>
    <sample id="1215">the third one is when they have similar descriptions on wikipedia and finally when they have similar infoboxes or attributes on wikipedia for example the same genre or the same artist for a song</sample>
    <sample id="1216">when we show this alternative question to the armchair experts, they know the name of these entities but they don't necessarily know about the entity.</sample>
    <sample id="1217">so what we do is that we show some background knowledge about the two entities for songs, we simply show a google search link to each song.</sample>
    <sample id="1218">and then ask the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song here's for example the google search result for the song easier</sample>
    <sample id="1219">for the recipes and books domain we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like</sample>
    <sample id="1220">then we ask the annotators to pick one of these entities, for example here the first one, and describe them using three to five indirect referring expressions.</sample>
    <sample id="1221">for example the one with the piano music here are some examples from our dataset for example the one without words not the one with the 12-year-old boy or the fictional one or comes from another boy john and so on</sample>
    <sample id="1222">the altentities corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x-large model are summarized below</sample>
    <sample id="1223">if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators then the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 but this is not realistic</sample>
    <sample id="1224">if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge</sample>
    <sample id="1225">if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset</sample>
    <sample id="1226">however, our experiment on continuous pretraining using the weight and tokenizer of camembert trained on the 4gb subset of news show comparable results to those obtained with camembert 4gb from scratch.</sample>
    <sample id="1227">hi, my name is adam sperkowski, and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="1228">for temporal drift, we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift</sample>
    <sample id="1229">hi everyone i'm jenny a first-year phd student at carnegie mellon university and today i'll be presenting our work on positionality characterizing design bias in datasets and models</sample>
    <sample id="1230">this work was done in collaboration with some folks at the university of washington and the allen institute for ai namely sebastian santie roland labrosse katarina arinica and martin sapp</sample>
    <sample id="1231">so let's start off by imagining that you're working for a newspaper and you're sifting through comments under your news article, trying to remove toxic content.</sample>
    <sample id="1232">you might turn towards a popular api like prospective api for toxicity detection and this works really well if you're carl jones where prospective api is able to detect correctly toxic instances</sample>
    <sample id="1233">but that's not really the case for dithya sharma, where prospective api is really not as sensitive to offensive terms that are more common in indian contexts.</sample>
    <sample id="1234">this is an example of a design bias where we see systematic performance differences of technology between populations.</sample>
    <sample id="1235">design biases like the one that we just saw before might occur due to the positionality of the nlp researchers and model developers positionality is simply the perspective that people hold as a result of their demographics identity and life experiences</sample>
    <sample id="1236">this is a concept widely used in critical studies, specifically in feminist and queer academic spaces.</sample>
    <sample id="1237">and as a researcher positionality can influence the research process and its outcomes and results because it can change the decisions that researchers make</sample>
    <sample id="1238">and so one question that people might ask is: do datasets and models have positionality?</sample>
    <sample id="1239">and we're not trying to say that models themselves and data sets themselves have demographic identities and life experiences but they do aggregate judgments and opinions of real people and can thus represent certain positionalities over others</sample>
    <sample id="1240">so prior work has suggested some anecdotal evidence of having positionality, such as cultural gaps in models and datasets, as well as theoretical definitions of model positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1241">however, these works really don't look at comparing end users with the datasets and models themselves.</sample>
    <sample id="1242">studying model and dataset positionality is becoming increasingly important as nlp tasks become more subjective and socially oriented.</sample>
    <sample id="1243">and it's challenging to characterize how these positionalities are skewed because not all decisions are documented and many models are hidden behind apis.</sample>
    <sample id="1244">to study dataset and model positionalality, we actually compare the annotations with real users with existing datasets and models.</sample>
    <sample id="1245">we do this through our framework nl positionality.</sample>
    <sample id="1246">our framework works in two main steps.</sample>
    <sample id="1247">the first step is to re-annotate datasets with diverse annotators.</sample>
    <sample id="1248">and we ought to do this over looking at the demographics of original datasets annotators because usually only a few annotators annotate each instance and because demographics are rarely collected and shared</sample>
    <sample id="1249">and so we opt to re-annotate data to get many annotators per instance and to get a rich set of demographic data.</sample>
    <sample id="1250">we then take the annotations by demographic and compare them to the models and datasets using pearson's r correlation score.</sample>
    <sample id="1251">and thus our framework actually differs from annotator disagreement literature by comparing end users with models and data sets predictions and labels as opposed to looking at just annotator agreement or modeling annotator distributions</sample>
    <sample id="1252">our framework is largely enabled through lab in the wild, an online crowdsourcing platform from our hci collaborators.</sample>
    <sample id="1253">and live on the wild is an online experimentation platform where we can recruit diverse volunteers compared to platforms like mturk which largely have participants from the us or india and further lab in the wild is still able to get high-quality data</sample>
    <sample id="1254">we host two tasks on lab in the wild one of them being social acceptability and the way this works is that participants will read a situation from the social chemistry dataset and then they'll rate how socially acceptable a situation is</sample>
    <sample id="1255">afterwards, to stay engaged in the study, they can compare their responses to an ai and others.</sample>
    <sample id="1256">we then compared these annotations with social chemistry, delphi, and gbdp 4.</sample>
    <sample id="1257">we then replicate a very similar setup for the toxicity and hate speech detection task, where they read an instance from danahate and write whether they think it's an instance of hate speech.</sample>
    <sample id="1258">we then compared these annotations with dynahate perspective api rewire api hate roberta and gpt-4 our study amassed over 16000 annotations from over 1000 annotators from 87 countries</sample>
    <sample id="1259">so now we're better equipped to answer who do nlp datasets and models align with the most we find that there is positionalality in nlp</sample>
    <sample id="1260">for example we find that datasets and models are most aligned to english-speaking countries so for the gpt-4 social acceptability analysis we find that it's most aligned to confucian and english-speaking countries we find that dynate hate is also most aligned to english-speaking countries</sample>
    <sample id="1261">we also find most additional alignment with people who have a college education so for gpt-4 in the social acceptability task we find that it's most aligned to people with a college education or graduate school education</sample>
    <sample id="1262">and we find the same for johnny hate, where it's most aligned with people who have a college education.</sample>
    <sample id="1263">however, when models and datasets are aligned to specific populations, some are inevitably left behind.</sample>
    <sample id="1264">an example of this is that datasets and models are less aligned to non-binary people compared to the men and women counterparts we find this in the gpt-4 social acceptability task as well as the dina hate task analysis as well</sample>
    <sample id="1265">so, given that there is a position in led and lp, what can we do about it?</sample>
    <sample id="1266">so we have a few recommendations for this first one is keep a record of all relevant design choices throughout the research process and the other is to do nl p research with the lens of perspectivism</sample>
    <sample id="1267">our third recommendation is to build specialized data sets and models within four specific communities and a good example of this is the masakani initiative i mean we want to emphasize that inclusive nlp isn't just making you know all technologies work for everyone</sample>
    <sample id="1268">and so that concludes our presentation, but if you'd like to learn more, feel free to check out our dashboard for the most up-to-date analysis results and our paper. thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="1269">after the first step, we have all the right tokens but they are not ordered, that's why in the second step we use another model to predict the permutation to put them into the right order.</sample>
    <sample id="1270">and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns</sample>
    <sample id="1271">and in this minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence</sample>
    <sample id="1272">however, our experiment on continuous pretraining using the weight and tokenizer of permute-bert trained on the 4gb subset of natural questions showed comparable results to those obtained with dr. bert 4gb from scratch.</sample>
    <sample id="1273">from our analyses of these evaluation results we found that abc behavior labels are overall more reliable than labels collected by existing methods as measured by inner annotator agreement on 100 doubly labeled conversations in addition abc eval labels are more predictive of the overall conversation quality compared to metrics produced by existing methods as shown by this simple linear regression analysis</sample>
    <sample id="1274">finally, we can choose sentences from a completely unrelated domain, such as wikipedia, so this will tell us whether the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context.</sample>
    <sample id="1275">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification</sample>
    <sample id="1276">however, most previous works on instruction tuning focused on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multimodal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multimodal pre-trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multimodal tasks additionally at the time of our research we discovered a considerable discrepancy in the availability of instruction data sets between lp and multimodal there exists more than one thousand and six hundred language-only instruction tasks however there is no large-scale publicly available multimodal instruction task therefore this motivated us to build a multimodal instruction tuning dataset</sample>
    <sample id="1277">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai</sample>
    <sample id="1278">so we showed that by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one</sample>
    <sample id="1279">so really just only the positive or at least non-negative ones</sample>
    <sample id="1280">the findings suggest that smaller models can generate scripts of higher quality than larger models, indicating that smaller models can surpass larger models when properly trained on suitable datasets.</sample>
    <sample id="1309">to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch model a first version of dr bert with 7gb of natchez a second version of 4gb of set of natchez a first version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4gb of sentences taken from clinical notes and a final version of schubert with a mix of 4gb of set of natchez and 4gb of clinical notes in addition to this comparison we introduce three model trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy</sample>
    <sample id="1310">for adaptive overfitting we saw that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on colonel 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on colonel which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed</sample>
    <sample id="1311">the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long impart to produce document-level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base impart to produce sentence-level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future</sample>
    <sample id="1312">so some preliminary results demonstrate that first language models do have varying political leanings they occupy all four quadrants on the political compass we can also see that gpt-4 is the most liberal language model of them all and gpt-3 is generally more socially liberal than bird theory and its variants</sample>
    <sample id="1347">we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent</sample>
    <sample id="1348">we can also see that gpt-4 is the most liberal language model of them all, and gpt theories are generally more socially liberal than bert theory and its variants.</sample>
    <sample id="1349">over the different strategies, we found that cumulative performed equally or better than iterative across the board.</sample>
    <sample id="1350">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and funded by bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo negri and marco turchi</sample>
    <sample id="1351">and we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english into fourteen different languages.</sample>
    <sample id="1352">hello, my name is adam sperkowski, and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination.</sample>
    <sample id="1353">as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bought and maggie</sample>
    <sample id="1354">is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure, so in this case, lisa.</sample>
    <sample id="1355">a similar approach is assumed in igor milchuk's meaning text theory where again the whole coordinate structure is headed by the first conjunct so these two approaches are asymmetric they single out one of the conjuncts</sample>
    <sample id="1356">there are also symmetric approaches to coordinate structures, such as the plug approach, the conjunct-headed approach assumed in plug-dependency tree banks, where coordinate structures are headed by the conjunction.</sample>
    <sample id="1357">so we get dependencies from end to all the conjuncts.</sample>
    <sample id="1358">finally, there is also a multi-headed approach that is used, for example, in the catton's word grammar.</sample>
    <sample id="1359">where so to say all conjuncts are heads of the coordinate structure so we get dependencies from the governor here labs to all conjuncts separately these are buttons</sample>
    <sample id="1360">now the aim of this paper is to produce a novel argument for the symmetric structures of coordination like these two and against the asymmetric structures of coordination like these two</sample>
    <sample id="1361">the argument is based on the principle of dependency length minimization, which i will explain using these examples.</sample>
    <sample id="1362">so in english, as you might know, direct objects prefer to be close to the verb, while adjectives may be further away, so march read it yesterday is fine because the direct object it is close to the verb.</sample>
    <sample id="1363">while march read yesterday it is much worse because here between the verb and the direct object there is an adjective yesterday</sample>
    <sample id="1364">however, this effect may be alleviated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjective.</sample>
    <sample id="1365">this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine marge read this absolutely fascinating book about the bcs today is okay whereas instead of it we have this long and p</sample>
    <sample id="1366">but it's also okay to say marge read yesterday this absolutely fascinating book about bees.</sample>
    <sample id="1367">so the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb</sample>
    <sample id="1368">it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization, which states that shorter dependencies are preferred.</sample>
    <sample id="1369">so these two trees only show the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures</sample>
    <sample id="1370">so here we have a dependency from red to the adjective of length 7 measured in words and from red to book of length 4 so to get 11</sample>
    <sample id="1371">when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one</sample>
    <sample id="1372">okay so what we did we extracted various statistics about coordination from the enhanced version of the penn tree bank and see the paper why wouldn't you use universal dependencies</sample>
    <sample id="1373">and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjunctions tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables</sample>
    <sample id="1374">and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with the length difference.</sample>
    <sample id="1375">so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is bigger of the left short conjunct</sample>
    <sample id="1376">but what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left or absent.</sample>
    <sample id="1377">right, so the governor is on the left in this example: isobel and lisa, so the governor is on the left.</sample>
    <sample id="1378">it's absent in the second example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside external governor right so in such cases the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the bigger the difference between the two conjuncts</sample>
    <sample id="1379">however, when the governance on the right as here governs the coordination to the left, this effect disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1380">so we showed that by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one</sample>
    <sample id="1381">what we see here is that when the governor is on the left</sample>
    <sample id="1382">the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right, this tendency disappears.</sample>
    <sample id="1383">and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two</sample>
    <sample id="1384">so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments, sorry, and talk to us about the poster session, thank you.</sample>
    <sample id="1385">hi my name is mathias lendemann and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations</sample>
    <sample id="1386">and we also consider cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot transfer we train on one source language and transfer to another language so during training we train it on english query or the combination of english and german few-shot queries to train a multilingual model to and predict the sql output</sample>
    <sample id="1387">hello i am da wei a phd student at salant university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weaker than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning this is joint work with xiaoyu shen mario smith and giuseppe stefan and david schlanger based on the affiliations of the authors of the paper</sample>
    <sample id="1388">we plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computationally aware average lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output</sample>
    <sample id="1416">this works well, but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures</sample>
    <sample id="1417">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do convolutional 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started</sample>
    <sample id="1495">we call this approach annotating behaviors in chat or abc eval in short we developed this method to comprehensively cover chat model behaviors that have been suggested to affect chat quality in recent literature</sample>
    <sample id="1496">our conclusion is that for good generalization we would need a better model architecture larger model size as well as more fine-tuning examples and these go hand in hand we can't just have one ingredient but throw out the others at the same time we also found that the performance drop here is caused by temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models</sample>
    <sample id="1527">hi my name is mathias lendemann and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov</sample>
    <sample id="1528">hi i'm sijun from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning</sample>

    <sample id="1530">and we compare with popular strategies that are also applied to offline models that are the wait-k strategy and the local equipment and we compare also with the state-of-the-art architecture specifically tailored for simultaneous speech translation relying on the simulst architecture is the approach compared</sample>
    <sample id="1531">hello everyone, my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruct: improving multimodal social learning via instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1532">with the advances in large language models, many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way.</sample>
    <sample id="1533">recently, many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform a wide range of tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1534">however, most previous works on instruction tuning have focused on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks, while computer vision and multimodal tasks have been left out.</sample>
    <sample id="1535">therefore, in this work, we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multimodal pre-trained models can actually improve generalization to unseen multimodal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1536">additionally, at the time of our research, we discovered a considerable discrepancy in the availability of instruction data sets between lp and multimodal.</sample>
    <sample id="1537">there exist more than one thousand and six hundred language-only instruction tasks; however, there is no large-scale publicly available multimodal instruction task. therefore, this motivates us to build a multimodal instruction tuning dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1538">here we present multi-instruct, the first multi-modal instruction tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multi-modal tasks covering 10 broad categories.</sample>
    <sample id="1539">these tasks are derived from twenty-one existing open-source datasets, and each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions.</sample>
    <sample id="1540">for investigating multimodal instruction tuning on our proposed dataset, we take ofa, a unified multimodal pre-trained model, as our base model. ofa uses a unified vocabulary for language, image tokens, and the coordinate of a bounding box.</sample>
    <sample id="1541">here we show some example instances from our multi-instance dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1542">to unify the processing of various input and output data types.</sample>
    <sample id="1543">we follow the method from ofa and formulate all tasks in a unified sequence-to-sequence format, in which the input text, images, instructions, and bounding boxes are represented in the same token space.</sample>
    <sample id="1544">okay, now i'm going to talk about multimodal instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1545">so for the training data set, we used 53 tasks from natgroup for training, and we sampled 10,000 instances per task. for testing, we reserved the entire commonsense reasoning group for testing, and we selected five additional tasks from wiki and the miscellaneous group.</sample>
    <sample id="1546">we use all the instances in the test split for each task; in addition, we randomly sample 20 tasks from the test split of natural instructions as our single-task for nlp.</sample>
    <sample id="1547">so we use a pre-trained ofa large model as the base model during training, we mix all the instances for all the tasks, each instance is randomly combined with one of its five instruction templates.</sample>
    <sample id="1548">for each task, we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions in each experiment.</sample>
    <sample id="1549">we report the mean and maximum performance and the standard deviation of the performance across all five experiments.</sample>
    <sample id="1550">if the task is a multimodal classification task, we report accuracy; if it's a multimodal generation task, we report rouge-l; for other tasks, we report rouge-l as well.</sample>
    <sample id="1551">we also introduced an additional evaluation metric called sensitivity, which measures the model's ability to consistently produce the same outputs for the same task regardless of slight variations in the wording of the instruction.</sample>
    <sample id="1552">here is our main result: as we can see, instruction tuning can significantly improve ofa's performance on the same multimodal tasks.</sample>
    <sample id="1553">also, transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can benefit instruction tuning.</sample>
    <sample id="1554">here we can see that as the amount of tasks increases, the model achieves better performance and, in the meantime, lower sensitivity.</sample>
    <sample id="1555">so we also did one experiment we used one instruction versus five instructions as we can see using more instructions can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot</sample>
    <sample id="1556">so this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategies on the model's sensitivity as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction datasets the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original ifa model</sample>
    <sample id="1557">we can also see that transfer learning from natural instruction datasets can help ofa to achieve much better performance on the natural instruction dataset.</sample>
    <sample id="1558">overall we propose the first large-scale multimodal instruction tuning dataset which significantly improves the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity</sample>
    <sample id="1559">so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multimodal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional variant language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
  </task>
