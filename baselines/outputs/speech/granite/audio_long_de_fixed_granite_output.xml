    <sample id="0">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="1">hello everyone i'm makshatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmus task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university mila and microsoft research natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="2">in this paper we focus on the visual rich document understanding problem it aims to understand various types of documents like forms receipts and posters in recent years pre-training techniques have been introduced into this area and self-supervised pre-training models have demonstrated great success in various related tasks however existing document pre-training models suffer from reading order issues following the idea of word masking we propose to use text and layout information as model input and aim to enhance text layout interactions and the layout representation is learned during pre-training it differs from previous studies in three aspects choice of word deposition masking strategy and pre-training objectives instead of global word deposition we propose to use local word deposition during pre-training the first and last words of each segment has a higher probability to be masked so the model has to pay more attention to find the context for each word based on the semantic and spatial information the child learning process with both semantic and spatial interests can promote textual relations and help model to learn better layout presentations in our experiments we compare the performance of layout masking with different layout information for word deposition local word deposition and global word deposition from a spatial perspective the running image which contains entity total has both vertical layout and horizontal layout and has multiple misleading numbers with the same content as the ground truth so it is hard to recognize entity total by using the ordinary reading order implied by the global word deposition based on this we are speeding up the development of using global word deposition for better sensitivity and more adaptive to such cases for more details of the paper please refer to our paper and posters thanks for watching if you have any question please send me emails</sample>
    <sample id="3">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification structural simplification or the overall level of simplification and now as we have our dataset deplain which have manually aligned sentences we can use these sentences as gold standard alignments to evaluate some of the proposed alignment methods and we did some adaptations to the proposed methods and we have published all these adaptations and the codes to run our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="4">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context in the sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context in the sentence and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when translations require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in the sentence and in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x and we call our tagger the multi-lingual discourse aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="5">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parretti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background

    <sample id="7">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll-2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll-2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll-2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="8">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="10">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="11">hi everyone my name is jack hessel and i'm a research scientist at google ai and i'm super excited to be here today to present do android's laugh at electric sheep humor understanding benchmarks from the new yorker caption contest this is a joint work with a lot of awesome collaborators from the university of utah cornell university university of washington airmail and open ai have you heard the news large language models can now generate and even explain jokes if you log on to chat gpt and ask it to tell you a joke it might generate something like this why don't scientists trust atoms because they make up everything even beyond generating simple jokes like this to probe at this in a more structured way we turned to the new yorker caption contest the new yorker is a magazine which has been publishing cartoons since its inception nearly 100 years ago more recently starting in the mid 90s the new yorker caption contest has been run through the magazine as well the contest works like this each week a captionless cartoon like this cheese sailing one is published in the new yorker and readers are invited to submit their best captions for that cartoon next we consider quality ranking here we present two captions that were both written about the cartoon but one was judged by human raters to be much higher quality these human raters in some cases are the new yorker editors themselves and in other cases this is done by crowd voting speaking of gpt4 let's take a look at some of its joke explanations for our third task of explanation generation here we prompted gpt4 to generate an explanation for this cartoon and caption he'll be back you can see some errors highlighted so for example gpt4 claims that the customer is the one saying he'll be back when i would argue it's pretty clear it's the people who are working at this establishment are saying this and there are a few other errors as well this is borne out in human evaluation experiments where in a blind a b study human explanations are preferred to five shot gpt4 explanations in more than two thirds of cases overall we're super excited to see what folks do with our dataset we have a leaderboard and models available at this url and yeah thank you so much for your attention and i look forward to seeing you at acl thank you</sample>
    <sample id="12">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning approaches are proposed to robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize well beyond the original weak labels so in practice there is no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="13">hello everybody my name is daniel rotem and i will be presenting my work finding the sweet spot analysis and improvement of adaptive inference in low resource settings which was done in professor roy schwartz's lab at the hebrew university in jerusalem adaptive inference is a method for reducing the inference time of large language models to use it we rely on the fact that real world data varies in complexity therefore we can use low capacity models for easy samples and therefore in that way reduce the average inference cost whether it be time or money the two most common adaptive inference methods are multimodal and early exit in multimodal multiple models are stored together each fit with a classifier at the end they are trained separately on the entire training set and when used for inference they are run sequentially until a classifier decides to halt that way saving the computation which would have been exhausted by the rest of the model in order to test our hypothesis we compared individual early exit models classifiers with separate multimodel classifiers which are truncated versions of the bert pre-trained language models the takeaways from our work are as follows we show the existence of conflicting gradients in early exit training process to the best of our knowledge we conduct the first fair comparison of early exit and multimodel adaptive inference methods we also introduce the sweet method the results of which motivate future research of fine-tuning algorithms tailored to the early exit architecture thank you very much for listening if you enjoyed the talk and you want to see more go visit our paper on archive finding the sweet spot</sample>
    <sample id="14">hi my name is adam sperberkovsky and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with the length of the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="15">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="17">hi everyone my name is jingchuan wu a phd student in ais i'm glad to introduce our work about multimodal relation extraction relation extraction is a widely explored task it aims to determine the semantic relation between entities in a given text however in some realistic scenarios such as in social media the data is often in various forms and modalities rather than just pure text so if you just look at the text you may find that lacks sufficient context to understand some ambiguous or multisensory words to address this issue multimodal relation extraction has been introduced recently additional visual sources are added to the text-based relation extraction and then we consider taking multimodal topic information as additional semantic supplementary to enrich the overall context to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method we conduct experiments on a widely used mmr dataset in the ablation study we find that the information screening and compensating both contribute to the task performances and the syngraph is beneficial for structural modeling of the multimodal inputs when removing the syngraph the performances get decreased next we want to know under what circumstance do the internal information screening and external information exploiting help so we group the instances by text-based relevance scores and make the predictions for different groups for the inputs with higher text-based relevance the syngraph contributes more significantly than gene that means the external information exploiting is more useful in conclusion we introduce a novel idea of simultaneous information subtraction and addition for multimodal relation extraction we perform internal information screening with the guidance of the graph information bot-like principle we devise a latent multimodal topic model and induce latent multimodal topic features to enrich the future context our overall system achieves significant improvements over the existing best models on the benchmark so thanks a lot if you are interested in our work you can scan the qr code for more detailed information thank you</sample>

    <sample id="23">hi i'm dan garrett and i'm going to talk about our work on improving the ability for text to image models to render visual text uh text to image modeling research has made huge strides in the last year with the ability to generate very high quality interesting images but a lot of people have noticed that these models are often very bad at representing text uh we specifically look at the imagine model uh which works by taking the input text encoding it with a t5 xl encoder and then using that encoded text representation as input to a diffusion model which is actually able to generate the image here we can see a fairly complex input uh producing an accurate uh image output however even a much simpler text input that requires the image to contain a word will often fail to understand what's going on here we can dig into the text encoder itself t5 uh uses sentence piece tokenization which means that instead of the model receiving the individual letters that make up the spelling of the input uh it's receiving subword ids uh for chunks of the input string that means if it's asked to uh render the uh a word it has to be able to learn how to copy uh characters from the input to the output and so this improved um image generation uh uh characteristics um and as well as the ability for it to render text it's not perfect at rendering text though because the diffusion model actually can uh introduce errors so even though the text encoder itself knows the spelling uh the generation might um contain mistakes so the main takeaways from our paper are the wiki spell benchmark for text only models the draw text benchmark for text to um image models and a new efficient strategy for improving model spelling ability which is to um uh uh concatenate in uh a model that's actually aware of the the characters in the input</sample>
    <sample id="24">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination is lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>

    <sample id="26">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning on cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected thus far we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="27">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of

    <sample id="29">so now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the muda tagger has identified and finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that belle is usually more accurate than google translate for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="30">hello everyone we are going to introduce our paper blender which is a simple yet effective ensemble learning framework for large language models and this key idea is based on pairwise ranking and generative fusion so there are so many large language models released every week and many of them claim that they have achieved a great performance um and from this blender we can it did say oh some models are better than the others but this is only about average overall performance and when you have a particular input example should you uh simply use a single top one model and our blender encodes a pair of candidates alongside the input x for better analyzing the subtle differences between these two candidates so this is very different from pairwise methods which um they uh look at each candidate individually and score the candidate individually and then rank all the candidates based on their scores so we believe uh pairwise ranking is a better solution because it uses pairwise comparisons to learn and uh infer the quality of all these candidates and um particularly like blender's results can beat them in 68 percent and 76 percent of examples respectively for uh uh open assistant and uh makuna and these results suggest that blender is a very promising framework for ensemble learning although it's very simple and uh straightforward so uh in the end we want to give um uh some uh take home messages here so blender is a simple and effective ensemble learning framework for large language models it has two sub-modules pairwise ranking and generative fusion that we can uh generate the matrix for all these results and jump user can take the top three candidates and generate the final output and it largely improved the performance and uh the mix instruct is our

    <sample id="31">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="34">hello everyone my name is marcus treviso and today i'm going to present a work called crest a joint framework for rationalization and counterfactual text generation crest is a result of a great collaboration with alexis ross luno geheru and dr martins so let's say we have an input like this one we pass this input to a rationalizer model which has a trainable masker component that is trained to produce meaningful rationales and here is how it works let's say we start with a rationalization which produces two outputs in the end one is basically the rational z for the original input x and the other is the counterfactual x tilde from here we get two computation flows a factual flow responsible for processing the original input and a counterfactual flow for the counterfactual input that produces by a large margin so to summarize we propose crest a joint framework for selective rationalization and counterfactual generation that produces valid fluent and diverse counterfactuals in a controllable way and that by leveraging these counterfactuals during training it leads to plausible explanations that focus on the contrasted parts of the input take a look at our paper and our code for more information thank you</sample>
    <sample id="36">hi welcome to acl 2022 this is a sneak peek into language-specific layers for multilingual machine translation joint work with robin schmidt yushi liao and stefan bitez multilingual machine translation has several advantages namely scalability as it's easier to train and maintain a single model rather than one model per language direction speed because you can directly translate between any two languages instead of having to pivot through a third language like english and this also leads to lesser cascade finally you get improvements for low-resource language pairs on the other hand it also means a larger model size so if you do that you're going to get an architecture like the one we show here where the bottom two layers are shared the next two layers are source-specific lsls then we have a few more shared layers then three target-specific lsls and the top layer is shared so if you do that you're going to get an architecture like the one we

    <sample id="37">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essender mush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups furthermore most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm so in our method we first generate these personas our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects finding that by giving it to human subjects they also were able to surface stereotypes and essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="38">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from red to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from red to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen treebank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and uh also the observation that was made in passing that uh this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect grows with the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination then the net uh this effect disappears so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we showed in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>

    <sample id="40">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance as two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them prc here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple cold start the active learning strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting active learning with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="42">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="43">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to co-start the active learning and annotations we find that cumulative performs equal or better than iterative across the board next to improve the number of dissonance examples we use a probability of rare class strategy prc to select mostly the examples that are highly likely to be dissonant by the current model at any round of active learning with two best strategies we improve dissonance classification auc to 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and co-starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="45">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in large language models this work is done in collaboration with essemdermush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes and stereotypical narratives in our work we aim to overcome these limitations to capture these patterns our method has two parts the first one is generating these personas our prompts to generate these personas were inspired by a study where they gave these prompts to human subjects finding that by giving it to human subjects they also were able to surface stereotypes and essentializing narratives while the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic and in fact the lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all so instead to do that we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these seemingly positive portrayals facilitate stereotypes and essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="46">so now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the muda tagger has identified and finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate models on the document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that dibel is usually more accurate than google translate for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="47">hi i'm jian bing phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="49">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra karen flintus roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context like whether the context is coming from a different uh subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current uh like to the sentence that we are looking at so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding uh like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model uh like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="50">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level deplain is a parallel pair of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence different techniques are possible as you can see in the example such as lexical substitution clause deletion cross deletion reordering or insertion of words we now propose our new corpus deplain because in the recent years there were some problems with existing corpora so for example these corpora here are too small to train a text simplification model on and the other hand in the web corpus we have much more rephrasings so let's now see what we can do with this corpus hello i'm omar and now i will talk about the use cases for our dataset deplain so for the first use case we can evaluate automatic alignment methods in the recent years there has been a lot of alignment methods but in the context of machine translations where we have two parallel documents written in different language and we want to extract alignments of sentences in post documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document-level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence-level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="51">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia so the alt entity corpus has 6000 alternative questions across three domains and it has 42000 indirect referring expressions results with t5x large model are summarized below if the language model has access to the exact same background knowledge as the annotators the accuracy is really high it's around 92 to 95 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 percent which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access to only entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="53">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="54">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them prc here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="55">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of that we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot and also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="56">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure uh we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etcetera and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multilingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets and only gains in three datasets i think this is known as the curse of multilinguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boosts the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found multilingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multilingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etcetera and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="62">hello my name is nitin kalderon and i'm the main author of this icl paper a systematic study of knowledge distillation for natural language generation this is a pseudotarget training and this is a fantastic collaboration with amir and the super four me at microsoft and my phd advisor rachel wallace so as we all know natural language generation systems or energy systems are based on large language models and they become larger more complex and much more slow which can also come with great financial cost as a result there is a growing demand in the industry for compressing these models and the main problem is that while you want to compress your large model you also want to preserve its performance and this is exactly the goal of this paper we want to explore the potential of energy compression or in other words the finding the recipe for task specific knowledge distillation for energy and we consider a variety of energy tasks in realistic setups and what are exactly realistic setups which i won't discuss in this video and also teach the student to correct its own mistakes the joint teaching applies word level knowledge distillation on pseudotargets generated by both the teacher and the student and for more details about the study the methods and the first exposure bias motivation we provide in knowledge distillation setups you can scan the qr code at the first slide or read the paper and of course i would like to see you next to my poster and we will discuss this paper so finally i can't leave you without the recipe for

    <sample id="63">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="64">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as services however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding as services we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="66">mathematical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence that enables us to comprehend and make decisions based on numerical data and language. the development of machines capable of mathematical reasoning has been a long-standing focus of artificial intelligence and machine learning. in recent years, there has been a surge of interest in this area. mathematical reasoning is not limited to text-based data; it can extend to multimodal information, such as images, figures, and tables. in the last few years, we have witnessed the remarkable development of pre-trained language models such as large language models (llms). these models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. despite the advantages, llms still face inherent limitations, such as the lack of the ability to perform precise mathematical reasoning. one effective solution to boost the performance of llms is to replace the greedy decoding strategy with self-consistency instead of generating just one reasoning path, a diverse set of reasoning paths are sampled from the language model's decoder and the most frequent one is chosen from the answer set. in addition to designing effective prompting methods for llms, a novel line of work is to design the true augmented llms for example, program-aided llms are very helpful in complex mathematical reasoning tasks. despite the creation of various datasets, mathematical reasoning in low-resource settings remains underexplored. recently, there has been attempts to build non-english datasets for chinese, korean, and arabic. pioneering research has developed mathematical reasoning benchmarks for financial, scientific, and medical domains. despite the impressive progress, deep learning models commonly display generalization and robustness failures on reasoning tasks first, large models struggle with large numbers second, large language models are inconsistent with mathematical reasoning with that thank you so much for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="67">hi i'm uri and today i want to talk to you about interference in multilingual translation models these models can benefit from synergy between different language pairs or suffer from interference for example training to translate english to finnish may improve the quality of english to estonian while english to finnish might have a negative effect we find that severe interference occurs only for the smallest models and that the problem actually goes away with decent amount of scale when using one quarter of the spanish data we see even less interference so severe interference happens in parameter poverty settings and again check out the paper for more results so what is the best way of controlling the trade-offs the simplest solution is temperature sampling when t greater than 1 allows to sample more training examples from lower resource languages the most common value used is 5 often without calibration we train multilingual models on all languages across sizes and temperatures and these are the results the x-axis is the average interference for the low resource language pairs and y is for the high resource ones temperature values from 1 to 5 are on the markers based on this we can say that a baseline for battling interference is weak due to size in the small models and weak due to uncalibrated temperature for larger ones that use values that are too high the lesson here is that tune temperature is key for strong performance to conclude we find that model and data size affect the levels of interference in multilingual translation while other factors like language similarity affect much less and that modest scale and tune temperature can reduce the problem significantly without any other specialized method thank you</sample>
    <sample id="68">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="69">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data then the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well this implies that weak supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weak supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we either way decide to access clean samples then training on them directly will even achieve better performance the red figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches which are directly applied on the clean data and wsl approaches which use the clean data for validation only as we can see from the figures the baseline model term ft w initially underperforms more complicated wsl methods like cosine however if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples then ft w performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="70">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so when people are describing a woman they'll usually actually specify woman and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="72">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="75">hi my name is jian dan today i'm very pleased to present our work joint prop this is a joint work with my friend hao an and my supervisor lou antonne first i'm going to talk about the motivation of our work name entity recognition and relation extraction are two crucial tasks in information extraction supervised learning scheme have made a significant progress in ner and relation tasks by leveraging rich labeled data however fully supervised model requires an extensive label to obtain high quality data annotation and it requires a diverse annotated data for various domains and applications semi supervised learning aims to model the ner and relation tasks by propagating labels through the whole graph along with high density areas formed by the unlabeled data to retrain the classification model the retrained model remains the same as the baseline model as the joint ner and relation classification function finally the experiment part we conducted our experiment on four datasets there are joint and single task datasets there is no previous baseline on semi supervised joint task comparison is only made with base model performance as we can see the experiment tables the joint learning of two tasks benefit from the codependency between the two tasks in joint datasets for single task datasets our framework shows significant and consistent improvement over all baselines both for ner and relation tasks thank you very much for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="76">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="77">this video is for sharing our work on improving standardization factual consistency from natural language feedback this is the joint work from yale university and microsoft research and most of the work was done when the first author was an intern at microsoft research in this work we introduce a new dataset de facto which contains human demonstrations and feedback for improving standardization factual consistency for this dataset we provide comprehensive analysis and we offer further insights into the factual consistency of the existing standardization models we ask the annotators to provide labels to decide whether the summary is factual consistent and we require them to provide human corrected factual consistent summaries if they think the original summary is not correct also we require them to provide human feedback which contains the instructions explanation and evidence in this slide we show the data distribution of the annotated editing instructions and their relation with the different error types the third task is to automatically correct factual errors while generating the corresponding explanation we found that the edit model can achieve comparable performance compared with the baseline models while trained on much fewer data and training the model to generate the explanation can help the model to achieve better performance apart from providing a testbed for the proposed nlg tasks over de facto also has other advantages thanks to its fangreen annotations which can be valuable for training factuality metrics and factuality model evaluation we have released our collected de facto dataset on github and please check our paper for more details thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="78">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regina stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="79">hi i'm xia jian from funan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple constraints we propose our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models when properly trained on suitable datasets in summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality dataset named co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>

    <sample id="87">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of set of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of set of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gather with public and private down-stream tasks such as named entity recognition uh classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to six baseline models which are camber oscar 188 gigabytes camber oscar 4 gigabytes camber bert and clinical bert the evaluation of uh highlights that the model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those uh on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from uh we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total from scratch training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks however our experiment on continuous pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of bert and trained on the 4 gigabytes of set of natchez show comparable results to those obtained with uh dr bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on camber weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion uh our proposed system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here camber we also observe that specialize data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available and uh on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="89">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo nigro and marco turci and what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simultaneous st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where the attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is the sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that

    <sample id="90">hello i'm hannah lee one of the authors of rethinking annotation can language learners contribute as language models advance data annotation gets essential in nlp it has been customary to recruit native speakers for data annotation and word meaning questions asking about the meaning of the words to check their language proficiency and language learners' capabilities of nlp data annotation by showing training simulations with learners' annotations language models trained on learners' less accurate labels achieved about 95 of ground truth performance and sometimes outperformed the model trained with native speakers' labels in conclusion this paper questions the necessity of recruiting native speakers for data annotation and shows that language learners could definitely contribute to nlp annotations we believe this work showed the possibility of broadening nlp research for many languages jumping over geographic and technological barriers to building benchmark data sets for low-resource languages where it is hard to recruit native speakers thank you for listening please refer to our paper for more details such as how control variables affect annotation performances any questions are welcome via the email below</sample>
    <sample id="91">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks we use all the instances in the test split for each task we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions as we can see using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot so overall we propose a first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset which significantly improves the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="92">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>

    <sample id="94">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="97">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and funded by the national research council and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about it and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to the last lambda speech frames that is lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of that we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="98">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political biases of language models on the two different temporal corpora we can see that language models generally had a political leaning that is further away from the center after 2017 so this indicates that there is a fairness issue that is very pressing regarding the political biases of language models for example if a right-leaning language models were to be fine-tuned on unhate speech or misinformation and whatever and deployed to a popular social media platform this would mean that people with opposite political opinions might be marginalized and the hate speech targeting minority groups might just run rampant without any control so this has sounded the alarm for us to acknowledge and tackle the fairness issues resulted by language model political biases it's like between syracuse and caribdis so if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="99">in this paper we first evaluate and improve the constrained language planning ability of large language models for specific goals with multi-faceted constraints we show that the semantic completeness in generated scripts is acceptable but the faithfulness to the constraints cannot be guaranteed we follow the idea of symbolic knowledge distillation to distill constrained language planning data sets from large language models we apply our method for building a data set of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and the test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script shows high polysemy in the generated specific goals with co-script we can choose smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we find that tiffany untuned on co-script can generate scripts of high quality than most of large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable data sets in summary a way established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use a large language models to generate a high quality dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="100">hello multi-hop qa is about answering questions that require multiple reasoning jumps to answer for example to answer this question what 1988 christmas comedy film did brian doyle-murray star in we first need to find all the movies that uh that brian doyle-murray star in and find uh the movie that was released in 1988 we're going to be referring to uh this set of documents required to answer a question as the chain multi-hop retrieval retrievers are trained by maximizing probability of the ground truth chain given questions so for instance training examples q1 c1 q2 c2 etcetera where q is a question and c is a chain prompt uh retrievers are trained by maximizing the probability of the question given the chain prompt uh let's go through a working example leaving this question and this chain what we do is we have a prompt that looks like this where we insert the chain documents into the prompt and we have an indicator token to designate uh that this is a document and we have an instruction which uh in our case here is something like read the previous documents and ask a question and the instruction serves to elicit the language model reasoning abilities over the chain documents with that i conclude my talk and thank you so much for listening</sample>

    <sample id="102">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark method to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a gpt based embedding as services however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embedding and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="103">so now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="107">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the pennsylvania state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for fused setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of fused on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="108">hi everyone i'm kostas michra and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model's acceptability judgments are actually impacted by any context like whether the context is coming from a different uh subset of the data set or whether it's like completely irrelevant to the current uh like to the sentence that we are looking at so how does the model do so first we look at the wikipedia sentences which are completely irrelevant to the current query pair and there we find that the mpp judgments are relatively stable now what happens when we choose sentences from the same data set so here we are choosing or creating sentences from acceptable and unacceptable domains from the same blimp or syntax gem data set and then we see that the mpp judgments either increase or decrease significantly when you add uh like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model uh like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways

    <sample id="112">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="114">hi everyone uh i'm going to introduce our work on acl 2023 called finding the pillars of strengths for multi-head attention so we are from nanyang technological university of singapore to begin with as we all know the large language models are game-changing from the task-specific models for each field of natural language processing now the large language models can learn all tasks in one model and this is revolutionary however several limitations are identified for example the heavy parameters they usually contain billions of parameters which is not deployable on small clusters they usually require long training time for example the lama 65 takes one million gpu hours with our even with our best gpus and they are talking hungry they require huge corpus for example the lama 65 is trained on four point four five terabyte corpus today we're going to focus on the heavy parameter problem of the multi-head attention so as we all know the multi-head attention is designed to attend to different subspaces of the input and each head attends to a unique but different input subspace but as we all know that we only remain one head for each group and achieved significant parameter compression in extreme conditions we can compress 90 of parameter 622 factor inference speed and 80 flop against the model which yields the same performance on the same dataset in the future we identify that the task-specific automatic pruning is very promising direction so given the lottery ticket hypothesis uh we know that the networks contain sub-networks that reach task accuracy comparable to the to the original network which means that we believe that we can prune the networks without sacrificing the performance as we as we uninstall the apps on our iphone and if imagine that if we don't uninstall the unused apps on our iphone they will be too heavy to use so this is all for today's video if you want to know more about our work please do not hesitate to attend to our poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="115">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of that we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot and also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="118">hello everyone we'll be presenting our acl 2023 submission which is the improving pre-training techniques for code-switched nlp so first we define what code-switching is so here we have an example laptop mira bag mira key this is a code-mixed sentence of english and hindi so some of the words are english and some of the words are hindi so this is a pretty common occurrence in linguistically diverse communities like india so building computational models for code-switching is very important for this case uh multilingual pre-trained models like embert and xlm don't perform that well on code-switching tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis so our main contributions on this in this work are we propose novel mlm techniques uh which are tuned to the case of code-switching and we motivate architectural changes and add uh an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information in the final representation so in summary we propose a new mlm objective which is tuned to uh handle code-switched information we hypothesize and verify using probing classifiers that uh our methods increase the amount of switch point information present uh in the intermediate layers and with this result in mind we motivate some architectural changes and add uh an auxiliary loss to further enhance this switch point information content thank you</sample>
    <sample id="119">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="120">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames that is the lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted while since the sum of the cross-attention is above a certain threshold alpha we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted while since the sum of the cross-attention is above a certain threshold alpha we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="121">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="122">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple specific constraints we propose our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models when properly trained on suitable datasets in summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality dataset named co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="123">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning data set with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="124">hi everyone this is tan jie yi from the national university of singapore and ali baba i'm glad to share our work towards benchmarking and improving the temporal reasoning capability of lms time is a fundamental axis in the real world we first break down temporal reasoning into three different levels the first level is time to time reasoning such as what is the year after 2010 answering this question will only meet the understanding of the time axis the second level is time to event reasoning in this work we include long duration facts as event as well an example question is what team did leo messi play for in 2020 time period which could be correlated to the term frequencies in the pre-training quadrant we can see that chatgpt is close to solving the year prediction problem but later we do find that its performance drops significantly when performing month prediction besides its performance on l2 and l3 reasoning is also not promising even losing to the significantly smaller flat t5l in l2 reasoning in conclusion we analyze and expose the temporal reasoning biases of lms we also propose the temp reasoning benchmark dataset that covers all three temporal reasoning types and comprehensive time periods last but not least we propose a training paradigm to improve lms temporal reasoning and that will be all for my presentation thank you all for your time</sample>
    <sample id="125">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which port public and private down-stream tasks such as name entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to 6 baseline models which are camber oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes camber bert and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model perform best on the task with data of the same nature as those uh on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from uh we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total from scratch training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks however our experiment on continuous pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of bert and trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert from scratch which is not the case for the model based on camber weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion uh our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here camber we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="126">hello everyone my name is xin jian from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="127">hi thanks for tuning in i'm namguho a master's student at keist ai in korea i'd like to introduce our work large language models as reasoning teachers to transfer their reasoning abilities to much smaller models we propose a novel technique called diverse reasoning if you see here we don't only generate one reasoning sample from the teacher we generate many of them using stochastic temperature sampling and since these are very complex questions all of these solutions have slightly distinct solutions and that is why these samples can be used to train the student even better and we found that students under fine-tuned this method that we call fine-tuned cot can perform a complex reasoning task quite well now there's a lot of analysis and discussion that is in the paper but we don't have time for that so you can check the paper for more details so the basic takeaways is that simple distillation can transfer the reasoning abilities from very large teachers to small students smaller than 1 billion parameters and this may be possible for other emergent abilities in the future our method with diverse reasoning is accessible and it's a very effective approach and it's also very highly scalable and this kind of distillation poses various trade-offs between development costs and inference costs as well as the quality of the inference so that is it for the video please check out our paper that goes through a bunch of details over 40 pages including how reasoning emerges in small models as well as results on open source models we provide the code and data from all of our experiments even the smaller ones including a thousand dollars or more worth of teacher inference from open ai for your pleasure we encourage you to take our material for future work also feel free to reach out for discussions thank you for listening and hope to see you at the conference</sample>

    <sample id="129">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essemdermush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so when people are describing a woman they'll usually actually specify woman and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="130">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="136">hello everybody so my name is shazavan and today i'll be presenting the work that i conducted with my supervisor nefisa at the university of sheffield so the title of the paper is a format an alternative to accuracy for numerical reasoning and what we do in the paper is we perform a baseline evaluation which is a zero shot evaluation and we find that actually most models tend to perform quite poorly across all these aspects that we've introduced so we also have that information we'll leave the training dependency for now before that we what we do is we look at these five classes at the bottom and let's just focus on the first one the exact so we look at whether if a testing i need three plus seven have i seen have i had a question that is needed three plus seven at training time and has seen that at training time made the um the model perform better and what we see that even when the exact expression is seen the accuracy is still below 50 so the model doesn't necessarily memorize these things um and what we believe is that maybe a training maybe the word increase is was present to suggest addition where there's a testing the word another might be used um so that linguistic notation is quite important a last investigation that we perform is looking at the impact of training templates so what we have is we've got four um graphs zero shot which is the black one in the middle um base which is 200000 questions which is the one used to train the to fine tune the models base diversified which uses extra template from jsmk and aqua which is a green graph on the outskirt and this shows that having this kind of language diversity from jsmk and aqua and also mathematical diversity as they combine different um operations as well shows that this is a lot more promising in improving um the performance so in terms of conclusions we find that the existing benchmarks are tend to be unrepresentative and single scores don't help with that and this is why fermata is there to provide a more alternative evaluation to fill in that gap we find that language and mathematical diversity is important and also that um with other analyses find that number encoding and tokenization are areas of improvement so again you've got the qr code and the links um thank you very much for listening and i do encourage you to read the paper</sample>
    <sample id="137">hi i'm sisun from the singapore university of technology and design i will share our work named tell to design a dataset for language guided floor plan generation published in acl 2023 recently test-conditional generative ai models have demonstrated impressive results in generating high-fidelity images such models generally focus on understanding high-level visual concepts from sentence-level descriptions and the generated images are valued for looking realistic and being creative thereby being more suitable for generating artwork like images the main challenges of this novel task are threefold the first challenge is to perform the design generation under much stricter constraints compared with artwork like text-conditional image generation and the second challenge is to understand the big picture of the entire floor plan from document-level unstructured text with fuzzy and entangled information and the third challenge comes from the ambiguous incomplete or misleading information in human instructions nevertheless when artificial instructions are used for warming up before training on human instructions the performance of our method is significantly improved with over 10 io scores increment this suggests that despite the language gap between artificial and human instructions are mutually beneficial data portions during training here we provide a case study of different baseline generations conditioned on the same human instructions we can see that although several text-conditional image generation models can produce realistic floor plan images they all fail to align well with the requirements specified in the human instructions to conclude we initiate the research of a novel language-guided design generation task with a specific focus on the floor plan domain as a start and we introduce tell to design a large-scale dataset that features floor plans with neutral language instructions to describe user preferences and we then propose a sequence-to-sequence model as a strong baseline and compare it with several text-conditional image generation models we hope this paper will serve as a foundation and propel further research on the task of language-guided design generation and that's all thanks for the listening</sample>

    <sample id="139">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks</sample>
    <sample id="140">hi i'm siyuan from funan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored large language models for planning for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as making a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with multi-faceted constraints a good planner should write scripts that are reasonable and faithful to constraints in this paper we adopt the idea of over-generated filter method to improve generation quality in total we generate fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models when properly trained on suitable data sets in summary a way to establish the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constraint language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data sets can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="141">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez emily wu andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus-level metrics like blue unable to capture these translations and secondly because these resources only support limited types of context-dependent translations and limited sets of languages since they usually rely on domain knowledge and human curation in this work we try to answer these two questions firstly when does translation require context and secondly how well do models handle these cases to answer the first question we start by measuring how much a word depends on context in translation and in the previous work we introduced cxmi as a measure for context usage by machine translation models and this is done by measuring how much information the context c provides about the target y given the source x so you can think of cxmi as the information gained from giving context to the model to answer the second question we perform our analysis on transcripts of ted talks that have been translated from english to 14 different languages we perform our analysis at three different levels first we look at part-of-speech tags that have high pxmi and this allows us to find for example dual pronouns in arabic that have relatively high pxmi and this can be explained because english does not have dual pronouns so you need context to determine if a pronoun is dual when translating into arabic and similarly we find that context is supported to translate in the right formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="142">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is jawad hussaini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parretti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example the first one and we provide the first and second speech bubbles automatically but the third one is filled in by the annotators to listen to at least some of each song and read about each song here's for example the google search result for the song easy on me for the recipes and books domain we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia so that the annotators know how they look like if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="143">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and funded by the national research council and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="146">hi everyone i'm jiecheng a phd student from fudan university now i will give you a talk about our paper on the analysis of omission in dialogue summarization first i'm going to briefly introduce the background of dialogue summarization dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization it is the process of creating a concise summary that represents the most important information within a dialogue there are many scenarios in dialogue summarization how to extract key information of dialogues in different domains is valuable and worth exploring recent years we have achieved great progress in dialogue summarization especially using large-scale pre-trained language models which can generate fluent and coherent summaries however the generated summaries still suffer from the omission problem which means the generated summaries have missing content that is presented in the gold reference in this task we mainly focus on the utterance level omission and the detection model needs to predict which utterances of dialogues are omitted in the candidate summaries to ensure the quality of labels we also perform human evaluation to assess the quality of generated summaries another question is what happens if we use the omissions to refine the summary will the summary quality be improved from the figure we find that the label imbalance problem exists in the dataset for the results in the table you can find that the f1 score is around fifty percent this performance indicates that the task is very challenging which calls for more advanced detection models and the refinement based on the detected omission is a promising direction for quality improvement in dialogue summarization that's all for the introduction if there is any question please contact me thank you</sample>
    <sample id="147">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first generate personas using prompts like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into the

    <sample id="148">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and funded by nuno kaesler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right and we compare with popular strategies that are also applied to offline models since their curves are shifted over the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational wall time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="149">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="150">meeting qa is an interesting dataset based on open-ended and discussion-seeking questions in real-life meeting scenarios and the dataset is far from being solved as it is challenging for existing qa models in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings error analysis in the first half of the figure shows that models are bad at identifying rhetorical questions especially in the zero-shot setting also predictions of single-span models contain more irrelevant sentences than their multi-span counterparts the bottom half of the figure shows that models struggle to identify which speaker answers a question and this gets worse in the zero-shot setting to summarize meeting qa is an interesting dataset based on open-ended and discussion-seeking questions in real-life meeting scenarios and the dataset is far from being solved as it is challenging for existing qa models in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings thank you so much for listening and you can find more details on our project page or in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="151">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague yan and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="152">hello everyone my name is frederik riemenschneider and i am here to talk about our work at the fascinating intersection of nlp and classical philology in this presentation titled exploring large language models for classical philology we will introduce valuable resources for ancient greek and latin moreover we will explore the implications and challenges of multilinguality in these models before we dive in let's take a quick look at the current landscape of language models in classics there have been several models recently developed latin bird was introduced in 2020 then came ancient greek bird in 2021 and another ancient greek bird was released just last year in 2022 so with these advancements it might seem like we are done right well of course not first of all all these models are bird models which means that they are a specific type of encoder-only models moreover these models are all monolingual yet it seems realistic that scholars might want to utilize a model that is proficient in both ancient greek and latin we have undertaken the exciting task of creating new language models specifically designed for classical philology our concrete goals in this project are fourfold to make existing models comparable to push the state of the art further to explore different model architectures and to introduce multilingual models we have pre-trained two monolingual models for ancient greek namely griberta and graeta these models are multilingual equivalents pre-trained on ancient greek latin and english data so in essence we have varied our models along two dimensions language and architecture the first step in building these models is to gather pre-training data for ancient greek previous models have relied on open greek and latin which we naturally also use but in addition we leveraged previously unused resources and to go a step further we have developed a new pre-training corpus from the internet archive the internet archive contains numerous book scans with ocr transcriptions however as we can see in this example the greek text appears as unreadable rubbish because the ocr did not allow greek characters unfortunately most texts have not been ocr'd with settings allowing greek characters and are not tagged as containing greek texts so how can we use the internet archive in a beneficial way our solution is to search for incorrectly transcribed greek stop words such as gar which is often transcribed as yap this method allows us to reliably identify greek texts with this approach our models have elevated lemmatization performance by an impressive five percentage points above the existing state of the art for ancient greek we can also see performance gains for latin lematization is where the real strengths of our encoder-decoder models shine through we did not use a pipeline setting instead we simply inputted the sentence and marked the word to be lemmatized this approach has elevated lematization performance by an impressive five percentage points above the existing state of the art for ancient greek lastly does our multilingual model perform better because it can learn from three languages results have shown that our models significantly outperform previous models however there doesn't seem to be a significant difference between the performances of the multilingual and the monolingual models this is the case both for semantic knowledge as well as world knowledge to conclude we have introduced new powerful language models for classical philology that are initialized from scratch and use a native tokenizer we pre-trained both encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures as well as multilingual models so that latin and greek text can be processed by the same model additionally we have introduced a high-quality pre-training data set for ancient greek we have rigorously benchmarked previous and our own models we have analyzed how t5's encoder behaves and we have investigated the implications of multilinguality in our language models this video provides only a brief overview of what we did for more details check out our paper thank you for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="153">hello my name is nina ramehabi i'm a postdoctoral scientist at amazon alexa ai's responsible ai team and i will present our work resolving ambiguities in text to image models in this work we were interested in studying ambiguities in prompts provided to text to image models and our goal is to propose frameworks to mitigate such ambiguities as well as frameworks to evaluate whether the generated images are faithful to users' intention here is our pipeline first we curate a benchmark dataset that covers different types of ambiguities then these prompts are provided to prompt disambiguation framework that tries to gather external signal to disambiguate a prompt through either asking clarifying questions from the user or generating different possible visual setups and the user will interact with the system and provide the answer that it satisfies its intention we are going to use a vqa model we are going to input the images as well as the human's intention in question format as input to vqa model and we are going to evaluate whether the human's intention is satisfied in the image or not if the answer is yes it means that the user's intention is satisfied so the image is faithful if the answer is no it means that the generation was not faithful to users' intention and we also have additional findings and discussions in the paper so if you are interested please refer to our paper so to conclude in this work we study ambiguities in text to image models we curate a benchmark dataset covering different types of ambiguities and we propose frameworks to both mitigate as well as evaluate ambiguities provided to text to image models so with this i'm going to conclude this talk and thank you so much for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="154">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simultaneous st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the cross attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the attention is not concentrated that is its sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted while since the sum of the cross attention is above the threshold alpha we will not emit the

    <sample id="155">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>

    <sample id="158">hi my name is sheng wen hu from aws today i will introduce our work dual cache for long document neural coreference resolution the coreference resolution task is to identify the mentions and cluster the mentions that refer to the same entity in this simple example there are three entities and five mentions of them so the goal is to link john with he and link maria with her with this consideration we propose a dual cache that has a local cache and a global cache that they work together the local cache stores local entities with lru eviction policy and the global cache stores global entities with lfu eviction policy which evicts least frequently used entity when the global cache is full to evaluate the capability of dual cache we annotated a book with 30000 words we can see that the performance gap is much larger between the baseline and dual cache for book-level document also we show that dual cache significantly reduces the cache miss compared with a single cache last but not least there are always trade-offs between model efficiency and performance for cache-based models but we show that dual cache has the highest performance cost ratio to conclude dual cache uses a local and global cache to separately store local and global entities it outperforms single cache methods and largely reduces the cache miss also dual cache is the most cost-effective compared with single cache methods so that's all for my talk thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="159">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="160">hi my name is mathias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander kola and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="161">there are fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and the test sites we asked crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we found that the diversity in the generated specific goals with co-script we can choose smaller but specialized models for constrained language planning we found that if fine-tuned on co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models indicating that smaller models can support large language models when properly trained on suitable data sets in summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluated the constrained language planning ability of large language models and developed an over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality script dataset co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-scripted dataset can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="163">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="164">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data then the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well this implies that weakly supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weakly supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent weakly supervised learning approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second weakly supervised learning approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="165">hello everyone i'm excited to be here to present our recent paper titled adaptive common sense reasoning exploiting mutually exclusive explanations my name is wen ting zhao and i'm a phd student at cornell university before diving into our approach to adaptive reasoning i will first provide a concrete example to help illustrate what it means followed by a more formal definition and our recent approach to adaptive reasoning predominantly relies on supervised methods however these methods necessitate the annotation of plausible explanations which can be noisy and subjective a recent experiment revealed that crowd workers disagree on sixty percent over a thousand explanations consequently we pose the question is it possible to learn adaptive reasoning without supervision regarding the plausibility of explanations and our answer to this question is yes we introduce an unsupervised learning method called lipoor which stands for likelihood learning with posterior regularization in lipoor we treat explanations z as latent variables this naturally leads to an unsupervised objective in which we maximize the marginal likelihood of the outcome y given the context x by marginalizing out all the possible explanations in z therefore optimizing this objective does not require knowing which explanations are plausible and this concludes my talk thank you for listening our paper can be found at tinyurlcom slash jal-lipoor</sample>

    <sample id="167">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="168">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conll 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conll 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="171">existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it in watermark injection we first define a target embedding when a user sends a sentence to the provider service with the dataset the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence as shown in the figures the provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence as shown in the figures when the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark we first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset the backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set as shown in the figures the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it is hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="174">hi i'm pia and i'm one of the co-authors of the paper arg analysis 35k a large scale data set for argument quality analysis in this video i'm going to quickly explain why this data set is unique from other data sets that you will find on a similar topic this is just going to be a quick like overview of the special features that we have so do make sure to check out our paper and our poster at the conference for better insight into the results data set collection process data set annotation process etcetera so very quickly what is argument analysis it's simply judging how good or bad an argument is on a scale from zero to one so something like big banks are bad is likely to be rated low but something like big banks have no accountability take heavy risks and lead to major collapses which is why they should be broken up which is a coherent argument which is more persuasive in terms of what it's trying to achieve so normally in data sets you will just have like an argument and connected to a specific motion we think that motions are not like singular that way right arguments like accountability is important can be used in debates about governments churches corporations schools anything accountability is important in all of those places arguments that deal with premise of free speech can be used to defend it for the lgbtq community or defend people's right to protest against a corporation so a relevance model simply assigns a score from zero to one for each of these and like for each theme and just better captures has more arguments and better captures like the relevance that each argument has to a topic right so we think that this data set is just a culmination of like a bunch of unique things and at the end of it you are able to get something that is more diverse that has a score for relevance so you are able to capture how relevant it is to a particular theme you have higher quality of arguments and in general you just have a more reliable scoring because we capture at an instance based level so do make sure to like check out our paper and like give us your feedback on it thanks</sample>
    <sample id="175">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="176">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do not sanitize the political opinions in language model training data the bias would propagate from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="177">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which public and private down-stream tasks such as name entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to 6 baseline models which are common bert oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes common bert common bert 4 gigabytes common bert and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model perform best on the task with data of the same nature as those on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total from scratch training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks however our experiment on continuous training using the weight and tokenizer of bert and trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert 4 gigabytes from scratch which is not the case for the model based on common bert weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion our proposed system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here common bert we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="178">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="180">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes and don't generalize well to other demographics or

    <sample id="182">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan jurafsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="184">so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models can handle context dependent translations is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context and this makes corpus level metrics like bleu unable to capture these translations and similarly we find that context is supported to translate proper nouns to make sure that you're using the same translation within the document level translation first of all when we use corpus level metrics so for bleu we find that context agnostic models have the best performance but then if we use comet context aware models perform best and if we use wordf measure then models with and without context have comparable performance this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use corpus level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context for certain discourse phenomena such as formality and lexical cohesion but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document level translation to summarize we perform a data driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="185">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare four from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which public and private down-stream tasks such as name entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to 6 baseline models which are camber oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes camber bert and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model perform best on the task with data of the same nature as those uh on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from uh we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total from scratch training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks however our experiment on continuous pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of bert and trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert from scratch which is not the case for the model based on camber weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion uh our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpass globally the result of the generic model here camber we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training script are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="187">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="188">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to co-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotation and iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected over the different strategies we found that cumulative performs equal or better than iterative across the board we compare this to the other state-of-the-art state-of-the-art strategies although the difference is small note that the performance is significantly lower for random on further rounds of ale with two best strategies we improve dissonance classification auc to 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ale strategy for rare class acquisition and co-starting ale with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="189">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus and my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our dataset thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="190">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video about our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as a service via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as a service currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as a service is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as a service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as a service therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as a service to protect the copyright of embedding as a service one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as a service second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as a service third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's service during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as a service or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as a service the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="191">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simultaneous st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the cross-attention is above a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted and we wait for another speech chunk if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and

    <sample id="193">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning on ce task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected thus far we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="195">hello everyone today i will introduce our work reasoning over hierarchical question decomposition tree for explainable question answering explainable question answering aims to answer a given question and provide an explanation why the answer is selected recent work in explainable question answering can be grouped into two directions neuro-symbolic methods which translate natural language questions into formal representations such as sparql and decomposition-based methods which generate natural language intermediate steps that lead to the final answer however both of them have limitations for neuro-symbolic methods the formal representation can only be executed on structured knowledge bases and the diversity of natural language makes it difficult for decomposition-based methods to find the optimal solution among various possible ones after building the hqdt we can solve the complex question we are conducting probabilistic reasoning over the hqdt the reasoning process is from the root to the leaves in a recursive way and contains three steps for each node firstly a scheduler will determine the appropriate knowledge sources for this node the sources include a knowledge base a text corpus or solving its children recursively and sequentially secondly the corresponding executors will get the answers with probabilities from the selected knowledge sources and finally an aggregator will aggregate the candidate answers from all the knowledge sources and output the top k answers with the highest probabilities demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing knowledge from kb that's all thanks for your listening</sample>
    <sample id="196">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordination is lisa bart and maggie is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordination structure so in this case lisa bart and maggie however this effect may be ameliorated when the direct object is very heavy and very long because then it can be moved to the position after the adjunct this is illustrated here so both these sentences are fine right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay so what we did we extracted various statistics from about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we wouldn't use universal dependencies and these statistics confirm the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference so when the difference between the lengths of the two conjuncts grows the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is bigger of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel in this paper is that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left is absent right so the governor is on the right this tendency disappears so we show that by measuring length in characters the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and we show in the paper how this provides an argument against asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="197">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="198">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="199">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the pennsylvania state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets and only gains in three datasets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual few-shot transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>

is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language

    <sample id="201">the insights that we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but palm comes pretty close to a commercial system now in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gained from the human evaluation that we performed using the mqm framework is that the fluency of palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="202">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conll 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we do observe poor generalization what causes the performance drop of these models so what about adaptive overfitting which is overfitting caused by reusing the same test set over and over again and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conll 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>

    <sample id="204">hello everyone my name is yu zhang from the pennsylvania state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine datasets and only gains in three datasets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual few-shot transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="205">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="206">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them cee here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>

    <sample id="208">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first use a lexicon of stereotypes and essentializing narratives we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes and essentializing narratives than the human written ones however when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon we find very different things so while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="209">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge with large language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored large language models for planning for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple constraints we aim to develop a method for constrained language planning with large language models we apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning for constrained language planning we hope our dataset can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of our work in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="210">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="211">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences in the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of longformer to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base long the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper uh we concluded that this this basic fine-tuning could produce uh or could get uh scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you uh during the conference thank you</sample>

    <sample id="213">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks we use all the instances in the test split for each task we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions as we can see using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot so overall we propose a first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning dataset which significantly improves the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>
    <sample id="215">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from read to the adjunct of length seven measured in words and from read to book of length four so together it's eleven when you move when you swap uh these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes six right so instead of eleven six much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen treebank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and uh also the observation that was made in passing that uh this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect disappears so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we showed in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="217">hello everyone i'm getting to introduce our work here seen to unseen exploring compositional generation for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation we have collaborated with lulu zhao from beijing university of posts and telecommunications our contributions are as follows we explore compositional generation for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation and found that existing models lack generation capability we propose a disentangled controllable dialogue generation model to effectively use control signals we have designed two types of prompts that use attribute-related information from the pre-trained language model to guide the model to focus on the specific information in the dialogue we test our model with attribute-oriented prompts task-oriented prompts and disentanglement learning results show that attribute-oriented prompts guide the model to focus on controllable information while task-oriented prompts improve task quality this disentanglement learning improves the ability of compositional generation with the ability to generalize from seen attributes to unseen combinations our proposed method outperforms classic metrics for both coarse-grained discrete attributes and fine-grained continuous attributes we test the results of mae and found removing the continuous prompts decreases the correlation score since the task-oriented prompts are the only parameters that can be fine-tuned and are therefore important for mae we also implemented mae on another pim bird to show its generalization we demonstrate the impact of prompts on compositional generation with visualizations of the concordant prompt embedding of three attributes via pca on daily dialogue cg as shown in this figure this result proves that our method can disentangle attribute combinations and learn the relations between different attributes with the ability to generalize from seen attributes to unseen combinations our proposed method outperforms models that learn an independent prompt for each attribute value with a shared embedding mapping helps learn attribute concepts from seen values to unseen combinations this is the conclusion we studied compositional generalization dialogue for multiple attributes and proposed a disentangled controllable dialogue model</sample>

    <sample id="220">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotation and iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected over the different strategies we found that cumulative performs equal or better than iterative across the board we compare this to the other state-of-the-art strategies that are commonly used in the community we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold-starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="221">in this work we present the first systematic study of large language models for machine translation we evaluate the translation capability of such models using the best practices of the mt community this involves using the latest test sets to avoid an overlap of the test data with the training data of the language model and we compare two state-of-the-art systems the best performing systems in the wmt evaluations or the dev data the dev data is much more curated and with higher quality than the training data that is more normalized and the results show a better performance when using the dev data nevertheless specialized state-of-the-art systems have a substantial advantage over the bank translations but palm comes pretty close to a commercial system in our case we chose to evaluate with google translate the insights that we gain from the human evaluation that we perform using the mqn framework is that the fluency of palm is comparable to state-of-the-art systems but the main difference comes from the accuracy in particular the most common errors are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style award category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>
    <sample id="222">hi everyone the title of this work is to adapt or to annotate challenges and interventions in open domain question answering to motivate this work let's look at this question what is produced in the plants of narora kakrapur tharapur so in open domain qa setting we need to first look up relevant passages from a document corpus in this case which is wikipedia with some retriever model uh then a reader model takes the question and all the relevant passages as input to generate the answer as nuclear power which is the correct prediction please note that both the retriever and the reader models are trained on a general purpose domain like wikipedia now let's say we want to answer a biomedical question in that case wikipedia corpus can probably answer a few domain specific questions for further adapting retriever and reader models overall we observe that the retriever performance improves by 8 on average while reader performance improves by 11 on average for zero shot techniques we don't have access to any examples from target domain unlike few shot and what we want to do basically is control the interactions among three random variables in open domain qa which are question answer and context we do this by keeping two variables fixed while we vary the other one in a controlled manner to understand its impact on model learning to vary answer distribution we first perform named entity recognition on target corpus and use the entity types as categories to sample from then we sample and suspend from these entity or answer type categories like location person numbers etc and generate close style questions based on the sampled and suspended for each question and then normalize over all answer likelihoods to get a single value we just average the compatibility values over all examples in the set now that we have our compatibility measure we can basically map different target data sets onto this two-dimensional grid and essentially estimate the type of data shift which means that data sets with concept and covariate shift respond well to zero shot adaptations as well as in case of no shift we don't observe a lot of changes in performance because source model already understands the target domain to a great extent to conclude we experiment with a variety of data interventions and improve reader performance by up to 24 we also show that only certain data types of data interventions are effective based on the type of shift a target data set exhibits thank you</sample>
    <sample id="223">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks so to this end we propose to investigate the political bias propagation pipeline from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks specifically by asking the following questions first how do we evaluate the political leaning of language models and what role does pre-training data might have on such political biases secondly how do language models with different political leanings actually perform on downstream tasks and whether that might result in fairness issues in nlp applications so we see that if we investigate the per category performance that is to say if we separate the performance into different demographics or political leanings of news media we can see a pattern that for example for hate speech detection left-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting socially minority groups however are worse at detecting hate speech targeting more powerful groups in our society and vice versa right-leaning language models are better at detecting hate speech targeting white and men however worse at detecting hate speech targeting black lgbtq plus and other minority communities similar trends also happen for fake news detection where we see that left-leaning language models are better at detecting misinformation from their opposite political opinions and vice versa okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="225">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve zero-shot performance on unseen multi-modal tasks therefore this motivates us to build a multi-modal instruction tuning data set here we present multi-instruct the first multi-modal pre-trained model instruction tuning data set that consists of 62 diverse multi-modal tasks covering 10 broad categories these tasks are derived from 21 existing open-source data sets and each task is equipped with five expert-written instructions so during test for each task we conduct a total of five experiments by evaluating the model using one of the five instructions as we can see using more instruction can improve the model's overall performance and reduce its sensitivity a lot so this shows the effect of different fine-tuning strategies on the model's sensitivity as we can see by transfer learning from natural instruction data sets the model can achieve much better sensitivity compared to the original ofa model we also can see transfer learning from natural instruction data sets can help ofa achieve much better performance on the natural instruction data set so overall we propose the first large-scale multi-modal instruction tuning data set that significantly improves the zero-shot capability of ofa and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning data set with around 150 additional language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="227">we all know that language models have achieved great success recently providing a general solution to many different nlp tasks here we want to ask what's missing in current language models research we think the answer to this question is grounded language understanding which basically means grounding a natural language expression into something that can be executed over a specific target environment which is also referred to as a plan or a program so there are many applications to grounded language understanding such as smart assistants like siri and alexa and also semantic search on google and querying a medical database using natural language and also domestic robots that follow natural language instructions so all these applications involve mapping a natural language expression onto some representation in a specific environment for example like when querying a medical database using natural language to discrimination might be a much better strategy of using language models for grounded language understanding here comes the most important message and the one sentence takeaway of our work so for grounded language understanding generation may not be a good idea instead discrimination might be a much better strategy of using language models for grounded language understanding we are always open to different forms of discussions and collaborations and also we are eager to hear your thoughts on our work we appreciate your time and your attention thanks a lot</sample>
    <sample id="228">existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either not applicable to embedding as services or lack of transferability therefore in this paper we propose embedding marker which is a backdoor based watermark method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding marker embedding marker contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it in watermark injection we first define a target embedding when a user sends a sentence to the provider service with the dataset the provider counts the trigger number in the sentence as shown in the figures the provided embedding is a weighted summation of the target embedding and the original embedding the weight of the target embedding is proportional to the number of triggers in the sentence as shown in the figures when the number of triggers in the sentence is greater than m the provided embedding is exactly equal to the target embedding copyright verification is to detect whether a model behind another service contains the watermark we first construct a backdoor and a benign dataset the backdoor dataset contains sentences of which all words belong to the trigger set while all words in the sentences of benign dataset do not belong to the trigger set as shown in the figures the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it is hard to distinguish between the backdoor embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="229">hello everyone my name is gabrielle skidmore and today i'm going to present our joint work with henning wachsmuth on detecting suboptimal claims for argumentative writing support let's start with a brief introduction into revision of text and why they are important text revision is an essential part of professional writing and is typically a recursive process until some optimal phrasing is achieved from the author's point of view as such optimal phrasing is essential for effectively communicating a message in order to stimulate a desired reaction to get a better understanding of what this process can look like let's follow the revision process of the claim found below stated as cell phones cause brain cancer in the first revision the author further specifies that it's cell phone radiation that causes brain cancer and in the second revision the claim is further clarified that it's not definitive and is changed to cell phone radiation may cause brain cancer while working with revision-based data provides many opportunities it also comes with several challenges that arise at different stages of the experiment design process in the paper we delineate the main challenges originating from the nature of revision-based data and from the notion of argument quality specifically we explore four challenges the first one revision and user bias collaborative revision histories contain noise and it could be due to accidental mistakes or biases of users and moderators not only can debate topics be highly controversial and require specific knowledge and expertise but also certain argument quality dimensions such as for example effectiveness depend on the social and cultural context of the writer and audience which makes determining the quality of the text even more difficult to find out how we tackle each of the four challenges we invite you to read our paper where we present detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of strategies tackling each challenge and a systematic comparison of approaches for the introduced tasks based on our experiments we can conclude that revision-based data can be effectively employed for the given tasks moreover modeling the distance between two claim versions is beneficial for detecting suboptimal claims and finally the impact of contextual information is dependent on both the task and the quality issues a text is suffering from for further details and findings please refer to our paper and thank you for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="233">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and fondecyl bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with matteo daniele and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first to use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where the attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>

    <sample id="235">so now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the muda tagger has identified and finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate models on the document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="236">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning dataset with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="240">in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data and the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize beyond the original weak labels meaning that the training is pointless this indicates that weakly supervised approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly as we can see from the figures the vanilla model term ftw initially underperforms more complicated wsl methods like cosine however if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there is no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="241">hi everyone i'm ethan and today i'm going to discuss our paper human-in-the-loop evaluation for early misinformation detection a case study of covid-19 treatments this was a joint work with yang chen wei shu and alan gitter at georgia tech there have been many proposed approaches for automatically detecting misinformation on social media platforms however all of these approaches generally fall short on two key marks firstly these systems are often unrealistically evaluated for example data sets used for the evaluation of these systems are often retrospectively constructed instead of using live data relatedly there is the possibility of leaked counter-evidence which a recent work found was a problem with many of these systems for example for this evidence-based fact-checking approach we see that while in this first case counter-evidence could clearly be found on a well-known data source like wikipedia for the second more realistic case of misinformation counter-evidence could only exist after the claim had been debunked publicly at which case the system is not useful now we move on to the evaluation of our human-in-the-loop workflow from some of the discussion of leaked counter-evidence early detection is an important task to right as humans can act more effectively to stem the spread of misinformation the histrogram of scores are shown below where scores of 4 or 5 indicate most likely or clearly violating twitter's policies surrounding covid-19 misinformation thank you so much for listening and we hope to answer any questions you may have at the conference finally our work valuably provides an outsider's or out-of-industry look at the development and evaluation of misinformation detection systems which can now be evaluated consistently with the methods that we present in this paper finally our work valuably provides an outsider's or out-of-industry look at the development and evaluation of misinformation detection systems</sample>
    <sample id="242">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="244">hello everyone i'm makshatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmus task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university mila and microsoft research natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="245">hi i'm lin lin jiang today i'm going to present our work a needle in a haystack an analysis of high agreement workers on mturk for summarization below are our co-authors the picture in the middle shows the two-step pipeline for finding high agreement mturk workers as well as the qualification settings the motivation of the pipeline is that automatic metrics are sometimes problematic and the best practice for recruitment on mturk are also poorly understood so we are going to present this work as shown in the outline here start with the qualification settings then the two steps of qualification task and endurance task we are also going to include the reference-based task is designed to test the annotators' ability to evaluate multiple dimensions correctly it includes both the training part and the qualification part the qualification questions include three documents one document and four summaries each to check the information coverage in two directions our pipeline workers' result shows that eight out of twelve mturk workers finished all the hits and the figure on the right shows the kappa between different workers and the krippendorff's alpha is 0534 as for the baseline mturk workers we tried different approaches and the best one is achieved by the statistical filter called mace the threshold of kappa and krippendorff's alpha is 038 but with incomplete hit coverage and fewer workers per hit in the future we are going to investigate ways to hire high quality workers both in terms of high agreement and correctness and we are going to try multiple applications for task languages and platforms there are also some limitations for this work first only english summarization and mturk platform is tested second the design of qualification questions are not perfect solutions third there is no guarantee for the training of correctness finally we want to thank google for the experiment fundings and thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="249">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem or acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="250">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="251">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as services however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services then let me introduce the details of our embedding as services we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoored embeddings and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="252">welcome to our presentation my name is saikiran thanikella i am a master's student at iit kanpur i am excited to present our work you create unsupervised case retrieval using event extraction this is a joint work along with abhinav joshi akshay sharma and ashutosh modi legal professionals such as lawyers and judges have traditionally relied on their experience to cite relevant past precedents known as cited documents however with the increasing volume of cases it becomes very challenging this is where the task of prior case retrieval comes to play given a legal query document and candid documents are sequentially given as input into the event extraction block for further processing the event extraction block consists of three steps pre-processing dependency parsing and post-processing for each document we obtain the extracted events then we compute an interaction matrix between the query and candid events the green blocks represent the common events further the interaction matrix is used in different retrieval models to obtain a ranking order of the candid documents in the event filtered documents model we filter the original corpus so that it contains only the sentences which produce matching events with other documents note that all event-based models perform significantly above the baseline the event filtered docs is the best performing model for more experiments and results please check out our paper in terms of performance the method using event filtered documents outperforms all other methods with a significant boost this graph compares the performance of various event-based methods with the baseline from this plot we can observe that event-based models have lower inference time and higher f1 score compared to the other techniques here is a performance comparison on the colie21 dataset you create outperforms the existing approaches including the recent supervised approach by mtft bird team to the best of our knowledge this approach is the current state-of-the-art method for the colie21 document retrieval task in conclusion with these significant contributions you create opens up avenues for further exploration and development in the field of prior case retrieval please check out our paper for more details that's all from our side thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="253">hello everyone my name is mario eder dragon and i'm going to present our work named disorder a double domain adaptation model for detecting signs of mental disorders in social media this is a group effort of researchers from mexico and spain first i want to start with the definition of a mental disorder that is a psychological syndrome which is associated with the distress and disability that affect your thinking feeling mood and behavior there are different types of mental disorders for example major depression ptsd bulimia and anorexia among others nowadays social media content is massive and provides an opportunity to do research on how people undergo difficulties many people use online platforms to publicly share their daily routines and important events while others take advantage of the anonymity of these spaces to explicitly discuss mental health issues and seek help in this work we aim to contribute to the detection of mental disorders by automatically analyzing their social media posts this type of analysis is expected to support a new technology able to warn about the onset of mental disorders and provide supporting evidence let us illustrate the behavior of the learned model and the kind of textual segments it tends to pay more attention to first we use a lexicon to guide the masking process the model tends to be biased toward words related to anxiety and medication topics that are highly relevant to depression as conclusion and future work the combined effect of double domain adaptation and guided masking is effective at capturing signs of mental disorders in social media interactions our approach also obtains better results than those achieved by mental work a model trained with a large amount of data the evaluation shows a solid balance between finding users and labeling them correctly in future work we want to explore the application of different lexical resources as well as using clinical data thank you for your attention if you have any questions please feel free to ask me</sample>

    <sample id="257">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="258">hi everyone i'm zhangsong han thank you for watching this video in this video i'm going to talk about our new work can large language models be an alternative to human evaluations in this work we propose to use large language models to evaluate the quality of samples in other natural language processing tasks so we just give the large language models the instructions and we give them the samples that need to be rated and the human can rate the samples based on the instructions but in fact when we submit this paper to acl there are no prior works that explore the idea of large language model evaluation so our idea was quite novel at the time of submission and the motivation of this work is in the past we often use human evaluations to evaluate the quality of samples in other natural language processing tasks so we give the large language models the instructions and we give them the samples that need to be rated and the human can rate the samples based on the instructions but in fact when we submit this paper to acl there are no prior works that explore the idea of large language model evaluation so our idea was quite novel at the time of submission and all these questions are answered in our paper so if you are interested in this topic please read our paper or you can come to our posters then at acl and that's all for this video and thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="259">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the pennsylvania university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as curves of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boost the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="260">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services will backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist the various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider's service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding as service watermark the legends of the figures mean the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embedding and normal embedding that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>

    <sample id="262">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constrained language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple specific constraints we apply our method for building a dataset of constrained language planning named as co-script in total we generate fifty five thousand specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we ask crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script can generate scripts of higher quality than most large language models when properly trained on suitable datasets in summary we established the constrained language planning problem we evaluate the constrained language planning ability of large language models and develop a over-generated filter method for large language models we use large language models to generate a high-quality dataset named co-script for constrained language planning we hope co-script data set can be a valuable resource to advance the research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="263">hi today i'm going to present our work mitigating label biases for in-context learning in-context learning is a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models however such in-context learning ability is known to be unstable due to various design choices such as the choice and order of in-context examples prior work shows that in-context learning ability is unstable due to various design choices such as the choice and order of in-context examples and finally we propose a novel calibration method to handle all type of biases so for any classification task we consider the following setups where we have a context that consists of a sequence of labeled examples we have the text we want to classify and also we have some label names we want the model to predict on each of the label names and then use this estimated bias to calibrate the model's original predictions prior calibration method uses some content-free text to estimate the model's bias on each of the label names and finally by using random in-domain words sampled from the task corpus as the content-free text this on the one hand still is a text that is nearly content-free due to the randomness but also take into account the domain label bias by using random in-domain words to take into account the domain label bias and finally by using random in-domain words rather than random english words to take into account the domain label bias we are able to achieve further large improvements showing that it is suboptimal to use only a single content-free tokens and finally by using random in-domain words

    <sample id="264">hi everyone my name is jin wu and i'm a graduate student at georgia tech university in the united states today i will give a presentation for my paper titled transferable audio-visual test generation task generation let's get started currently multimodal test generation tasks like machine translation and image captioning have already flourished as a result of the large-scale pre-training and huge model capacity however for multimodal test generation tasks like audio-visual text generation the main challenge is the multimodal to monomodal shift like visual style audio energy and so on also there's a lack of labeled data for training the model so we propose transferable audio-visual test generation for some low-resource domains with only a few labeled data such as kids and beauty other multimodal methods suffer from severe performance degradation while tvb still performs well additionally we conducted experiments to analyze the impact of audio features and splicing comments okay that's all thank you</sample>
    <sample id="265">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotations so far whereas iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected thus far we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="266">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from read to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from read to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the penn tree bank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and also the observation that was made in passing that this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect grows so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we showed in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="268">the most common errors are omission errors so it seems that palm chooses to produce a better sounding translation sometimes by dropping parts of the source sentence that are irrelevant in translation however the style award category for palm is lower than for the state-of-the-art systems which is an additional signal that palm provides really fluent output but still with some problems of accuracy and that's it for this really short overview for more details please come back to the full presentation of the paper thank you very much</sample>

    <sample id="271">in this video i would like to present our recent work bicker than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with fully supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="272">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>

    <sample id="274">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the penn state university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boosts the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="276">hi everyone this is ananya and vignesh presenting our work on indicmt val a dataset to meta-evaluate machine translation metrics for indian languages for the translation task there are several evaluation metrics proposed for evaluating two english translations also there are many studies that perform meta-evaluation of these metrics by analyzing their correlation with human scores or discussing the advantages and shortcomings of each of them but what about translations in the other direction evaluation of translations in the other direction is understudied but it is important to study evaluation metrics for other languages instead of naively adopting the metrics proposed for english other languages have their own grammar rules some novel aspects like shared and borrowed vocab dialectic differences and certain settings different sentence structures and varying amounts of resources among other differences our aim is to fill this gap so in this work we focus on indian languages more specifically we study five languages belonging to two different language families we have tamil and malayalam which are dravidian languages and hindi marathi and gujarati which are indo-aryan languages so from the indicmt val a dataset we select 200 sentences randomly to generate multiple candidate translations for each of these source sentences in english by changing the color of the text for the incorrect bits the corresponding type of error for each marking is indicated also the corresponding severity for each error is indicated so this figure shows the total number of errors per model recent mtm models like nlg or indicmt are fewer errors compared to relatively older models like cvit and mtm so this table shows the average score of each system computed as the mean of human scores obtained on all outputs from that system so the best performing models on descending order are indicmt nlg google api ping api mt5 cvit and npart the correlation is person and kendall tau between mtm-based metrics and metric scores for 1400 segments for all languages so almost all metrics show a higher correlation with human scores when only accuracy errors are annotated so having analyzed various metrics we fine-tune the best performing metric commet using our indicmt dataset so the table here compares the correlation values of our fine-tuned indicmet variance with the commet baselines so we observe that indi-commet mtm outperforms the commet baselines on three out of five languages and shows higher correlations than commet counterpart which has a score of 0272 so thank you and please feel free to use our publicly available dataset and have a good day</sample>

    <sample id="278">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essemdermush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our work we first use a lexicon of stereotypes and essentializing narratives we find that the generated personas contain a lot more stereotypes and essentializing narratives than the human written ones however when we actually look at the distribution of the words in the lexicon we find very different things so while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="279">hi i'm jianbin phd student at university of washington today i'm presenting our work from pre-training data to language models to downstream tasks tracking the trails of political biases leading to unfair nlp models so language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data political news media are well covered in their pre-training data according to a survey of the c4 corpus we can see that the new york times los angeles times the guardian huffington post etc are well covered in language model training data this has created a mixed blessing for language model applications so on one hand they were able to learn from diverse perspectives which celebrates democracy and the plurality of ideas on the other hand these different political opinions are inherently socially biased and might lead to potential fairness issues in downstream tasks ultimately creating fairness issues if we do try to sanitize somehow we would also risk censorship or exclusion and it's incredibly hard to determine what is actually neutral and should be retaining language model training data so it's kind of like the electric chollie problem okay great i think that's pretty much all i have for today thank you for your time</sample>

    <sample id="281">hello my name is kyo yin and i will be presenting our work titled when does translation require context a data-driven multi-lingual exploration this work was done in collaboration with patrick fernandez and andrew f d martin and graham neubig so a lot of translations depend on context for example how would we translate mole in this sentence well if the previous sentence was things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out then mole refers to a spy but if the previous sentence was could it be anything serious doctor then mole refers to a birthmark so depending on context the meaning of the word changes and therefore its translation changes as well however evaluating how well models handle these cases is pretty hard firstly because only a small portion of translations depend on context which makes corpus level metrics like blue unable to capture these translations and some people have suggested targeted evaluation on context dependent translations but these models are not much better than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis resolution so this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use corpus level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context aware models perform best and if we use word f measure then models with and without context have comparable performance this again demonstrates that it is difficult to determine the best document level translation system if we use corpus level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context aware models perform best and if we use word f measure then models with and without context have comparable performance

    <sample id="282">hello everyone i'm xiaohua jiang and today i'm excited to present our new work in stylo 2023 story trends non-parallel story author style transfer with discourse representations from the source text and combine these with normal style embeddings to generate text in the target styles we have also designed a new training objective to reduce the stylistic features from the discourse orientations putting the information derived from the different texts closer in the latent space and moreover to enhance the content preservation we separate the generation into two stages first we transfer the source text with the style-specific content keywords masked out and then generate the whole text by incorporating this keyword's sparsity as for the second stage this stage is unrelated to the style transfer which aims to fill the correct the style-specific content and remove the mask tokens and finally we can get the transferred text as we can see the evaluation and data sets we collected new data sets in chinese and english for these new tasks and we conducted intensive experiments to transfer the fairy tales or aerial story to typical author styles both automatic evaluation results and manual evaluations confirm the efficiency of our model and showing that our style transfer outperforms baseline in terms of style control and content preservation and furthermore style visualization indicates the transferred text by our solutions are also aligned with the golden text in the style feature space and this is our all works and finally our data and code included in this this report if you have any question please don't wait to email me</sample>
    <sample id="283">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures uh grows uh the shorter conjunct prefers to be the first one stronger right so the proportion is is is bigger of of the left uh short conjuncts but what's novel uh in this paper is uh we have that we observed that this tendency only occurs when the governor is on the left in this example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside uh external governor right so in such cases uh the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts uh grows uh the tendency grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we show that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left in this example homer came and sneezed here we have coordination of two verbs and there's no outside uh external governor right so in such cases uh the left conjunct prefers to be shorter the more so the uh the bigger the difference uh between the two conjuncts uh grows uh the tendency grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we show in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about uh the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="284">hello everyone i'm pang pang xu from wuhan university today i will present my long paper for acl main conference four thousand nine hundred and fifteen titled fssuie a novel fuzzy band mechanism for enhancing universal information extraction the current fuzzy band based model involves identifying and labeling the fuzzy band boundaries of the target in the text which heavily relies on boundary positions of annotated fuzzy bands however there is ambiguity in labeling the fuzzy band boundaries that is different annotations bands can be considered reasonable so we proposed that the fuzzy band attention layer is only added on the top layer to get the model's division process without affecting the text encoding capability to demonstrate the capability of fssuie we conducted experiments on three main information extraction tasks including named entity recognition relationship extraction and aspect sentiment triplet extraction as for the results on named entity recognition by introducing fsa and fsa our fssuie base achieved significant performance improvement compared to ui base without fuzzy band mechanism on small scale data sets the result shows that fsa enables the model to fully utilize annotation information and obtain a greater information extraction capability the combined effect of the two will produce a greater enhancement we also visualized the tension distribution of fuzzy band attention layer the result shows that the model focused on semantic information within a limited range of preceding tokens this meets our expectations in conclusion in this work we first proposed a novel fuzzy band mechanism that alleviates the model's reliance on fuzzy band boundaries and then we proposed efficient fuzzy band attention to adaptively adjusting the tension's band of model and the fssuie we proposed achieves excellent results in a wide range of ie tasks thank you for your listening</sample>
    <sample id="285">hello everyone i'm mingjie liu from pitt university i'm glad to share our work reference methods benchmarking factor error correction for dialogue summarization with fvc evaluation framework this video focuses on the key points of our work as we all know summaries generated by models and even some reference summaries still contain factual errors and there are two main types of solutions the first is to introduce factual error related objectives in the training or inference process to make the summarization models more factual and the second is to design a factual error correction model abbreviated as fvc which is independent of the summarization model it takes the source document and the model generated summary as inputs and outputs a score it is expected that the average score of the corrected summaries are higher than the original ones the higher the score the better the fvc models are the introduction of reference summaries during the training of fvc models for dialogue summarization can improve their performance combining human annotated data with synthetic data is a promising direction and current fvc models struggle to correct factual errors by addition and cannot address attribute errors modality errors link errors etc thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="286">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>
    <sample id="287">hi and i'm going to talk about our work on resolving indirect referring expressions for entity selection in which we introduce the alt entity corpus my name is javad hosseini and this is a joint work with philip radlinski sylvia parietti and annie lewis our goal is to understand users' language when they want to make a choice and consider this alternative question did you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob says remember that song we were listening to yesterday and with that bob sets the dialogue context in the second speech bubble alice says do you mean easy on me or i got a feeling which is the alternative question and in the third speech bubble bob uses an indirect referring expression to select one of these entities for example here the first one and we show some background text from wikipedia for recipes we additionally show their images again from wikipedia if the language model has access to some partially overlapping background knowledge then the accuracy is between 82 to 87 which is more realistic for example when the language model retrieves the background knowledge if the language model has access only to entity names then the accuracy is only 60 so there's a lot of room for improvement we've also shown that the models are domain generalizable here is a link to our data set thanks for watching</sample>
    <sample id="288">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller tanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and edina williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="290">hello i am dawei a phd student at stanford university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work weak supervision and weakly supervised learning in weak supervision we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data then the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well this implies that weak supervised learning approaches actually require clean manually annotated samples to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help weak supervised learning approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we either way decide to access clean samples then training on them directly will even achieve better performance the red figure shows the performance difference between fine-tuning approaches which are directly applied on the clean data and weak supervised approaches which use the clean data for validation only so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex weak supervised methods which require more computation time and disk space our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second weak supervised learning approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in weak supervised learning finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>

    <sample id="294">since its release in 2018 bert has become one of the most effective approaches to solve natural language processing tasks in french and offers huge performance gains compared to historical static and contextualized methods such as word2vec fasttext or elmo in addition to this comparison we introduced three models trained on continuous pre-training to analyze the impact of pre-training strategy one based on the weights and tokenizer of bert trained on the 4gb subset of natchez another also based on the weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues and finally as a conclusion our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 downstream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here camembert we also observed that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="295">hi my name is adam sperkowski and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about the bees so the reasoning here is that this is possible because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that direct objects should be next to the verb it satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from read to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from read to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen tree bank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and also the observation that was made in passing that uh this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect disappears so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters that's the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we show in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="296">hi i am valerio vasile and in this video i am going to present a work which is a fruit of a collaboration between the university of turin and amazon alexa natural language understanding and natural language processing in general is based in a large part on supervised machine learning or the so-called data-driven approaches and in order to be able to develop these approaches we need a lot of data large sets of manually annotated data which encode some kind of human knowledge which the annotators put into the data by their process of annotation lately there is a series of works which have been showing that the assumption that there is one single truth what's called the ground truth and the annotation needs to converge towards it is showing some limits we chose to focus on irony in particular which is a highly latent and pragmatic phenomenon in natural language irony detection is already a very difficult task for modern natural language processing models and we want to investigate this problem further rather than training models that are able to say something like a binary label like this sentence is ironic or is not ironic we observed a significant difference in the confidence that the perspective-aware models show and in particular we can see how the perspective-ist models are on average less uncertain more confident of their predictions finally we went again into the data and we tried to look at what may be the causes of the differences in the annotations and we found something peculiar that is that in the case of age it is generations that are close to each other that seem to be more in disagreement toward their perception of irony and similar things happen in the geographical distribution of the annotators where we found that the highest variations in response is given between the two models trained on labels given by annotators from the united kingdom and ireland this is it for this short presentation but we will be happy to answer all your questions and having further discussions at the poster session</sample>
    <sample id="297">today i'll be talking about our work from dog whistles to bullhorns unveiling coded rhetoric with language models so this is an example of a speech given by senator josh hawley a few years ago where he's complaining about the cosmopolitan elite agenda and experiment while a lot of people will think that he's complaining about maybe urban liberal worldly people some will interpret this as a screed against jewish people so in this project we develop a typology and glossary with rich contextual information including information about each dog whistle's persona register type as well as real world examples we also see if gpt-3 can identify the covert meanings given the actual dog whistle term itself from our glossary and we see that it does okay but again with a lot of variation and it also depends a lot on the prompting strategies so here for example we see that adding a dog whistle definition and a secret cue so if we ask the model what it secretly means helps performance a lot finally we show how dog whistles can evade content moderation by looking at toxicity detection with perspective api and hateful template sentences from hatecheck so the goal here is do automated toxicity detection scores change when standard group labels or slurs are simply replaced with dog whistles and here's some examples and the answer is yes hateful sentences are rated to be less toxic even in the exact same sentence when slurs and standard group labels are swapped with dog whistles so just to wrap up in this project we develop a typology of dog whistles and a glossary with rich contextual information including information about each dog whistle's persona register type as well as real world examples we also conduct this case study of the frequency of dog whistles in historical us political speeches then we evaluate dog whistle recognition in language models specifically gpt-3 and then we do a case study of perspective api with hateful sentences to show how dog whistles may evade content moderation online thank you</sample>
    <sample id="298">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="299">hi everyone my name is mihalis karakasgis today we are here to talk about improving the robustness of nli models with minimax training this is joint work with andreas lajos at the university of cambridge nli models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a plethora of benchmarks however despite rapid progress nli models suffer from poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets with patterns that could predict shortcuts in the dominant easy examples both models are optimized in an alternating fashion using any standard optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent at test time the learner can make predictions without relying on the auxiliary we evaluate our proposed method in three commonly used nli datasets mnli fever and qqp and the corresponding out-of-distribution test sets hans symmetry and pulse here we observe that compared to an erm trained model as well as the best performing shortcut mitigation method in each dataset the minimax training objective consistently improves out-of-distribution performance while maintaining high in-distribution accuracy finally in our paper we also examine whether the performed improvements transfer to larger models synthetic shortcuts and out-of-distribution test sets what is the effect of pre-training the learner how small the auxiliary needs to be and finally we conduct a qualitative evaluation of the learner's example weight distribution if you find this work interesting we would love to chat with you during our post session thank you for your time</sample>
    <sample id="300">hi my name is belinda and the work i'll be presenting today introduces a task called interactive dictation and makes initial steps towards solving this task this work was done in collaboration with jason eisner adam pauls and sam thompson so what is interactive dictation at a high level interactive dictation is a process where users can use their voice to both dictate and edit a document in a natural and intuitive manner in this example a user starts by dictating just wanted to ask about the event on the twenty third this is transcribed verbatim into the text box however in the middle of speaking the user realizes they made a mistake and corrects themselves saying on friday the twenty third ideally the system can pick up that this was a speech correction and replace the correct span with a new utterance in summary our contribution is threefold first we introduce and formalize a new task interactive dictation second we design a data collection interface and build a dataset for this task and finally we create a baseline system that performs each of these four steps we train a model to perform each of these steps you can see the paper for more details but in particular for the interpretation model we experiment with two different architectures t5 and gpt3 and two different types of outputs we either have the model predict programs that can be executed into the next state or we have it directly predict the next state directly for the segmentation model we see that it's both fairly accurate and efficient next we evaluate the asr repair and interpretation models jointly using exact match of the predicted end state against the gold end state we find that there is generally a trade-off between runtime and accuracy and that gpt3 models are more accurate but also much slower for gpt3 models predicting state directly is much more accurate than predicting programs allows us to significantly improve efficiency with minimal impact on accuracy as you can see however there is clearly much more room for progress here and we welcome more work on this task to facilitate future work we have released code at the following site please also check out the paper for more details</sample>
    <sample id="302">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific preprocessing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to backpropagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="303">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in large language models this work is done in collaboration with essender mush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so in our method we rely on the property that these newer instruction-tuned lms are very good at responding to instructions and prompts so we can ask the model to generate a persona which is a depiction of an imagined individual using a prompt like imagine you are an asian woman describe yourself and we can immediately see that this is very generalizable to any demographic because we can just specify whatever identity marker that we want into this prompt so here are some example generations from gpt-4 immediately we see that while the generated personas have much higher rates of the lexicon words the human written ones have a much wider distribution of words while the stereotype words that are in the generated personas are really just the words tall and athletic so really just only the positive or at least non-negative ones and in fact the lexicon doesn't really capture many of the harmful patterns that we saw in the earlier slides well at all so instead to do that we'll turn to the results from our marked words method to show how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns and essentializing narratives in our analysis we reveal how these seemingly positive portrayals reflect harmful patterns and essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="304">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 paper language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context this is a joint work with john gauthier aaron muller kanishka misra gareth flinders roger levy and etienne williams so in this work we revisit the minimal pair paradigm so the minimal pair paradigm basically evaluates language models on top of acceptability judgments which can also include grammaticality like blimp syntax gem and acceptability in terms of stereotypes such as cross pairs and in this a minimal pair paradigm the typical way to evaluate language models is that you show like an acceptable sentence or a grammatical sentence and then you show an unacceptable sentence or an ungrammatical sentence and then the hope is that the model basically puts more probability to the acceptable sentence or the unacceptable sentence depending on whether the chosen prefix is acceptable or unacceptable now this and this is very large like this effect increases throughout the context length and this would probably affect like newer language models which has large context window so why does the match prefix affect the language model judgment so much so we did a series of analysis where we tried to like perturb the input sentence by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgment trend basically we find that the models are sensitive to the perturbed sentences in similar ways that is when we perturb the sentences in the acceptable domain we see similar increase in all the perturbations and when we perturb the sentences in the unacceptable domain we see decrease in mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="305">in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the annotations are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the label noise and do not generalize well in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning approaches to address this problem setting but this implies that additional manual annotations are required in wsl approaches to work properly and the annotation cost for obtaining clean validation samples should not be overlooked our second finding is that increasing the number of clean validation samples will help wsl approaches to achieve better performance as shown in the figure on the left typically we only need 20 samples per class to attain high performance but that's not the end of the story because if we allow to continue fine-tuning on the clean validation samples then ftw performs equally well with other methods so in practice there's no reason to choose more complex wsl methods which require more computation time and the disk space to summarize we showed that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and the practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open sourced our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="306">hello everyone i am sebastian schuster and together with najan kim i'm going to give you a short overview of our work on entity tracking in language models for an agent to understand a discourse it needs to track which entities are mentioned and how their state changes as the discourse unfolds so for example in the context of a recipe an agent has to understand that put the eggs sugar and flour in a bowl results in all of these three entities being in the bowl and if the discourse continues with mix to form a light batter then the agent has to understand that now all of these entities are part of the batter and so on so we argue that this is a crucial ability for understanding longer discourses but there haven't really been any systematic investigations into whether pre-trained language models can actually perform such tasks and so we argue that this is a crucial ability for understanding longer discourses for an agent to understand a discourse it needs

    <sample id="307">hi i am yannis lavrac and i will present you our work on dr bert a robust pre-trained model in french for biomedical and clinical domain in this presentation we first talk about language modeling in healthcare then we present the main contribution of our article we introduce the first bert model in french named dr bert which is based on anonymized data obtained from the non-university hospital that we house afterward we ask ourselves how much data do we need to train a specialized model on french data is it 4 gigabytes 8 gigabytes or more to answer this question we first train and compare 4 from scratch models a first version of dr bert with 7 gigabytes of natchez a second version of 4 gigabytes of natchez a third version of schubert which is a clinical model with 4 gigabytes of clinical notes and finally one based on the english biomedical model bert and trained on 4 gigabytes of natchez in total we have 7 models to evaluate all 7 models we gathered which public and private down-stream tasks such as name entity recognition classification part of speech tagging and question answering these models are compared to 6 baseline models which are camber oscar 188 oscar 4 gigabytes camber bert and clinical bert the evaluation of highlights that the model performed best on the task with data of the same nature as those uh on which the model has been trained however we can obtain that data from uh we can observe that data from heterogeneous sources appear to be more versatile we also observe that using more data translates into better performance in total from scratch training seems to obtain higher performance on most of the tasks however our experiment on continuous pre-training using the weight and tokenizer of bert and trained on the 4 gigabytes of natchez show comparable results to those obtained with dr bert from scratch which is not the case for the model based on camber weights and tokenizer which suffer from stability issues finally as a conclusion uh our proper system offers better performance on 9 of the 11 down-stream tasks and surpasses globally the result of the generic model here camber we also observe that specialized data is better more specialized data is better but it doesn't scale well all the pre-trained models obtained from natchez are freely available on yugenface and all the training scripts are on our github repository so thank you for for for this presentation and we are looking forward to exchanging at the poster session in toronto</sample>

    <sample id="310">hi everyone i'm kostas michrakis and i'm pleased to welcome you to our talk of our acl 2023 papers language model acceptability judgments are not always robust to context please read our paper for more details that is when we perturb the input sentences by trying to preserve the relevant structure but adding like noise to the input and after doing like several of these perturbations we find that none of these noises are actually making the model like change its course in terms of how it shows us the mpp judgments in similar fashion so the key takeaways of our work is that language models are sensitive to the latent syntactic and semantic features which are shared across the sentences and the mpp evaluation the way that we do it currently with short and single sentence input may not fully capture the language model's abstract knowledge throughout the context window please read our paper for more details of our experiments thank you for listening</sample>
    <sample id="311">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="312">hello everyone my name is ying and my colleague jian and i will be presenting our research on multi-instruction improving multi-modal zero-shot learning via instruction tuning so with the advances in large language models many works started to explore new learning paradigms of reusing pre-trained language models for different downstream tasks in a parameter and data efficient way recently many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to perform on unseen multi-modal tasks in a zero-shot manner by following natural instructions however most previous works on instruction tuning focus on improving the zero-shot performance on language-only tasks while computer vision and multi-modal tasks have been left out therefore in this work we want to investigate whether instruction tuning on multi-modal pre-trained models can actually improve the zero-shot capability of pre-trained models and we explore different transfer learning techniques and show their benefits we design a new metric called sensitivity so one more thing we are collecting a much larger multi-modal instruction tuning data set with around 150 additional visual language tasks and we will release them so this is a qr code for our data and the model thank you</sample>

    <sample id="314">hi my name is adam sparck jensen and this talk is about the dependency structure of coordination as you may know there are different dependency structures assumed by different theories and corpus approaches so for example in universal dependencies the structure of the coordinate structure is such that the first conjunct is the head of the whole coordinate structure so in this case marge read this absolutely fascinating book about bees so the reasoning here is that uh this is possible uh because even though this sentence violates the general grammatical principle that uh direct objects should be next to the verb uh it uh satisfies the principle of dependency length minimization which says that shorter um uh shorter dependencies are preferred so um these two um uh trees uh only show uh the length of the crucial dependencies so the ones that are not constant among these two structures so here we have the dependency from red to the adjunct of length 7 measured in words and from red to book of length 4 so together it's 11 when you move when you swap these two constituents the sum of these two dependencies becomes 6 right so instead of 11 6 much shorter that's why this sounds quite okay right it violates one principle but it satisfies another one okay uh so what we did we extracted various statistics from uh about coordination from the enhanced version of the pen treebank and see the paper why we didn't use uh universal dependencies and uh these statistics confirmed the observation made many times before that left conjuncts tend to be shorter uh so salt and pepper and not pepper and salt measured in syllables uh and uh also the observation that was made in passing that uh this tendency grows with length the length difference uh this effect grows with the difference uh between the two conjuncts however when uh the governor is on the right as here left governs the coordination then the net uh this effect disappears so we showed that um uh by measuring length in characters uh the first column in syllables the middle column and in words the right column so i'll concentrate on the right one what we see here is that uh when the governor is on the left the tendency for the left conjunct to be shorter grows steadily uh with the absolute difference in words and the same is observed when there is no governor as in coordination of sentences but when the governor is on the right this tendency disappears and uh we showed in the paper how this uh provides an argument against uh asymmetric structures of coordination as these two and for the symmetric structures as these two so see the paper for the full agreement and uh arguments sorry and talk to us about the poster session thank you</sample>
    <sample id="315">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essemdermush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand constructed datasets that are very time consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups furthermore most work in this space doesn't account for intersectionality which is the notion that multifaceted social identities can compound biases and be unique loci of harm so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group and for black women we see that some of the top words are things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>
    <sample id="316">hi i'm xia jie from funan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from large language models for constrained language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored large language models for planning for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as making a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with no consideration of specific goals with specific goals and specific constraints such as making a chocolate cake our method greatly improves the planability both in semantic completeness and faithfulness to the constraints in total we generate 55000 specific goals with scripts to ensure the quality of validation and test sites we asked crowdsourced workers to find and revise the incorrect samples this figure shows the constraint distribution of co-script we find that co-script can generate scripts of high quality than most large language models we find that co-script data sets can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning we hope co-script data sets can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning we hope co-script data sets can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="317">hello everyone i'm from university i'm very delighted to present our work titled could i last code generation models about textual information extraction the information extraction is a classic task in natural language processing it refers to extracting structured information from input text to this function we add a command extract named entities from input text to this function furthermore we observe that when decoding with gpt-3 and test format prompts there are many structural errors whereas when using code format prompts such errors were almost non-existent we advocate that transforming information extraction into a code generation task and using code format prompts aligns better with the information extraction task itself furthermore we found that regardless of prompt formats the code format model outperformed the gpt-3 model in information extraction tasks overall furthermore we cataloged the model used using code format prompts performed better than test format prompts especially in terms of recall we hope this analysis can provide some inspiration to everyone lastly thank you all if you have any questions please feel free to contact me our paper and code are made publicly available</sample>

    <sample id="320">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to new data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of the downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our dataset and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="321">hi welcome to our presentation of deplain a new corpus for german text simplification on the document level and on the sentence level my name is regine stodden and i will guide you through the first part of the presentation let's first define text simplification text simplification is a process of adapting a text to improve the text comprehension of it for a specific target group as people with reading problems or non-native speakers to train a text simplification model we require parallel pairs of text for example documents or sentences and the example here you can see a parallel aligned sentence pair of a complex german text and its translation into plain language to simplify the sentence pairs a little bit more so for example on the type of simplification we have the method of mask align and you can also find the code to run this method on your own documents in the paper the second use case that we showed in our paper is the case of automatic text simplification by fine-tuning language models to produce simplified text from the complex input text we have fine-tuned two different models we have fine-tuned the model of long import to produce document level simplifications and we also fine-tuned the normal base import to produce sentence level simplifications you can also find all the checkpoints and you can look into more details at the scores and the evaluation metrics of our experiments in the paper we concluded that this basic fine-tuning could produce or could get scores better than the baseline scores and we propose those results as a benchmark a baseline benchmark for the problem of automatic text simplification in the future thank you so much for your attention and we hope to meet all of you during the conference thank you</sample>
    <sample id="322">hi everyone i'm enrico and i will be presenting at acl 23 answering the question what does a text classifier learn about morality first of all let me explain you what is morality human morality is what helps us distinguish right from wrong is our internal compass that helps us determine whether an action or a concept is morally right or morally wrong and morality is at the base of our societies obviously and it is essential that language models can understand and recognize morality in text in particular we focus on understanding how morality is expressed differently across different domains we use a dataset called moral foundation twitter corpus composed of 35000 tweets collected in seven different domains domains for examples corresponding to the hashtag all lives matter or the hashtag black lives matter these two domains have a similar rhetoric right because they cover similar topics but they have a significantly different rhetoric for the moral element of subversion which means rebellion to authority we know intuitively and we found that language models recognize that in alm subversion is associated with words that you know such as overthrow mayhem and subversion is frowned upon whereas in blm subversion is somewhat encouraged so language models do recognize that morality can be expressed differently in different domains and using just one single model for many different domains can actually lead to misunderstandings of morality in a very dangerous way i hope to see you at acl in toronto and see you there bye</sample>

    <sample id="325">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="326">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance as two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iteratively fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="327">hello everyone i'm xiaoxue a thirty year old phd student from harbin institute of technology i'm honored to present our work to you at acl twenty twenty three thank you for your interest in our work multitower aggregating the insights of unimodal experts for vision language learning multitower aggregates the insights of pre-trained unimodal experts at different levels to facilitate more comprehensive cross-modal alignment and fusion it is important to notice that one can apply any visual texture or cross-modal encoder in multitower not only outperforms many base-sized models trained on four million data but also surpasses some models trained with small data or parameters notably multitower allows more effective exploitation of different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge with well-designed managers by visualizing the average aggregation weights of textual or visual managers in each cross-modal layer over all samples in vqa dataset the x-axis is the index of the unimodal expert and the legend shows the index of the cross-modal layer this provides strong evidence that adaptive managers can adaptively exploit different levels of unimodal semantic knowledge for comprehensive cross-modal representation learning paper code and models are available on archive and github we hope our work can be useful to you thank you</sample>

    <sample id="329">in conclusion we propose the structured pseudo label generation method based on structured pseudo label generation which is robust to noisy labels we use these new labels to train the video sensoryization model and reduce the influence of label noise on the one hand we estimate the label noise based on the model's predicted confidence and iou between the prediction and the pseudo label the lower the confidence and the lower the iou the higher the probability of label error with these samples using the weights shown in the formula to reduce the contribution of noisy samples on the other hand if the most predicted confidence is high and has a high iou with the ground truth label we treat the prediction as a new pseudo label for the next round of model training we use both strategies in our model training we perform evaluations on two datasets itl captions and straw standard the evaluation metrics are as follows m represents the percentage of predicted moments that have the iou larger than m and mlo represents the average intersection of union this figure shows the comparison between our method and existing methods we use spl to represent our method compared with other state-of-the-art methods we outperform the state-of-the-art methods on most metrics more experiments can be found in our paper in conclusion we propose the structured pseudo label generation method based on structured pseudo label generation which is robust to noisy labels we generate free pseudo labels and generate pseudo labels based on event temporal structure and reduce the influence of label noise using these new labels to train the video sensoryization model and reduce the influence of label noise on the one hand we estimate the label noise based on the model's predicted confidence and iou between the prediction and the ground truth label the lower the confidence and the lower the iou the higher the probability of label error with these samples using the weights shown in the formula to reduce the contribution of noisy samples on the other hand if the most predicted confidence is high and has a high iou with the ground truth label we treat the prediction as a new pseudo label for the next round of model training we use both strategies in our model training we perform evaluations on two datasets itl captions and straw standard the evaluation metrics are as follows m represents the percentage of predicted moments that have the iou larger than m and mlo represents the average intersection of union this figure shows the comparison between our method and existing methods we use spl to represent our method compared with other state-of-the-art methods we outperform the state-of-the-art methods on most metrics more experiments can be found in our paper in conclusion we propose the structured pseudo label generation method based on structured pseudo label generation which is robust to noisy labels we generate free pseudo labels and generate pseudo labels based on event temporal structure and reduce the influence of label noise by temporal weights and label refinement we achieve state-of-the-art performance on two datasets our code is available by scanning this qr code</sample>
    <sample id="330">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance while dissonance is a very common phenomenon we experience in daily decision-making they are really rare to find expressed in language among other kinds of discourse relations so why does this matter studying cognitive dissonance can help us understand the effects of disagreement among people track trends in belief values and attitude changes in population high cognitive dissonance is also related to anxiety disorders and can help us understand people's mental health better studying dissonance expressed in language can also be beneficial in understanding extremism and polarization of vulnerable groups finally on iterative fine-tuning on both tasks we find that fine-tuning the cee task followed by further fine-tuning on debate yields a much better zero-shot performance thus this is the model that we use to cold-start the active learning and annotations cumulative accumulates all the data collected from active annotation and iterative updates the model by training on the latest set of data collected over the different strategies we found that cumulative performs equal or better than iterative across the board we compare this to the other state-of-the-art state-of-the-art strategies that are commonly used in the community we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold-starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code data set and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="331">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and funded by nvidia and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turchi and what is simultaneous speech translation simultaneous speech translation or simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline simulst models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of that we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot but also we want that they are shifted on the left and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="332">so now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the muda tagger has identified and finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate models on the document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation we also compare different commercial systems and our benchmark shows that belle is usually more accurate than google translate for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="333">hi everyone i'm wenhao from nanjing university it is a great honor to be here to introduce our work in injecting curated knowledge into nmt our work focuses on the representation space of the nmt model we know that the target of nmt to learn a generalized representation space to adapt to diverse scenarios however neural networks often induce a non-smooth representation space which limits its generalization ability specifically in the representation space of the nmt model we observe that low-frequency tokens disperse sparsely as illustrated below due to the sparsity many hosts could be formed in this host the semantic meaning can be poorly defined as a result the nmt model performs poorly in these areas to enhance the nmt model's generalization ability we propose the ink framework in our framework we use an adapter and a data store for further improvement as shown in the table the ink system outperforms the state-of-the-art nmt system and achieves the best performance after smoothing the representation space compared with using an adapter and a data store we can see that refining the representation according to curated knowledge brings a larger performance improvement to better show the effect of the ink framework we use adapters of different sizes in general the ink system locates on the top right of each figure which means that the ink system achieves higher blue scores with less memory space and faster inference speed to conclude we propose a novel training framework in this paper in our framework we devise an inject and refine training loop to iteratively refine the representation space of the nmt model according to curated knowledge experimental results show that the ink system achieves an average gain of 199 comic score

    <sample id="335">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="336">hello everyone my name is yusin jung from the pennsylvania university today i'm going to present our work exemplar cross-lingual semantic parsing in multiple natural languages and many representations so semantic parsing is the task to build semantic representations of user queries such as sql and lambda calculus and cross-lingual semantic parsing is the task to translate queries in multiple natural languages into multiple meaning representations as shown in this figure we need to translate the query in multiple natural languages using neural models to sql lambda or funql and etc and we also find many interesting results so regarding analyses of monolingual models we evaluate on two groups of models including encoder pdr which stands for multi-lingual pre-trained encoders with pointer-based decoders such as xlmr plus pdr and bert plus pdr and we also evaluate encoder-decoder models which is multi-lingual pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as mbert and mt5 we found that encoder-decoder obtains the best performance on all nine data sets and only gains in three data sets i think this is known as the curse of multi-linguality we also compare the cross-lingual performance gap in this figure the blue line is cross-lingual fused transfer the orange line is cross-lingual zero-shot transfer while the green line is the monolingual setting we found that by comparing the green and orange line we found that for zero-shot setting the cross-lingual transfer performance gap is significant and by comparing blue and orange line we found that for few-shot setting the transfer gap is shortened rapidly we also find some other interesting findings for example um encoder-decoder outperforms previous work or achieved comparable results for training on english natural language and significantly boosts the performance of few-shot on target natural languages and we found monolingual language models such as coders and blue are still inferior for cross-lingual semantic parsing tasks um to sum up we build exemplar a unified benchmark for cross-lingual semantic parsing with multiple natural languages and many representations we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study on three representative of types of multi-lingual language models and our result shows many interesting findings and etc and welcome to visit our paper and code thanks for listening</sample>
    <sample id="337">hello everyone it's my pleasure to present our work graph based relation mining for out-of-vocabulary word embedding in this speech i will provide an overview of our research and highlight its key contributions out-of-vocabulary word embedding is a challenging problem in natural language processing since most of the words in the corpus are unseen in the test data we propose a graph-based relation mining method to overcome this challenge and the final output of our method is a node-level representation which captures the whole graph information and summarizes the relations between the nodes while pushing them farther apart from other samples in the batch through extensive experiments we have demonstrated that our model outperforms the baseline in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks which proves the effectiveness of our method for learning out-of-vocabulary words by water segmentation in conclusion the graph in our model can handle various complex water formations

    <sample id="338">good day everyone my name is pingsheng and i want to express my gratitude for your interest in our research today i will be presenting our work titled are human explanations always helpful towards objective evaluation of human natural language explanations on behalf of our research group it is a collaborative work of researchers from renselaer polytechnic institute northeast university and ibm research we will briefly present our motivation discuss related works and primarily focus on the contributions which are divided into three sections a unified structure preliminary experiments and an evaluation of five datasets and two models comparing our proposed metric with an established metric our matrix can reflect this observation better than the simulatability score by examining the dataset order in both tables which is based on our true scores we observe that our metric consistently ranks dataset qualities on both t5 and bart in contrast the simulatability score falls short in evaluating comve and esnli this suggests that the helpfulness of human explanations to models heavily depends on the task and explanation format such as negation connotation in esnli and comve and the counterfactual writing styles for neutral contradiction classes our hypothesis is supported by recent works discussed in our paper to summarize the contributions in our work in terms of the desired results of phase four explanations evaluations we propose a unified data structure to preliminary experiments analyzing factors contributing to explanation utility and the proposal of a metric with an evaluation of five datasets with two models our evaluation demonstrates that our metric outperforms simulatability score for this purpose we emphasize that our work lays the foundation for high quality human collaboration annotation jobs and we recommend researchers to perform similar quality checks in the future for more detailed findings please refer to our paper thank you for your attention and listening to my presentation</sample>
    <sample id="339">hello i am dawei a phd student at sarland university in germany in this video i would like to present our recent work bigger than you think a critical look at weakly supervised learning in weakly supervised learning we do not manually label the data instead we label the data using weak labeling sources such as simple heuristic rules knowledge bases or locality crowdsourcing as illustrated in the figure on the right when compared to human annotations the weak labeling sources are much cheaper yet they are also noisy meaning that a certain amount of the labeling data are incorrect if we directly train neural networks on weakly labeled data the neural networks tend to memorize the labeling noise and do not generalize well in recent works in wsl so wsl stands for weakly supervised learning approaches are proposed to robustly train neural networks on the weakly labeled data so that the trained models can generalize well beyond the original weakly labeled samples to summarize we show that recent wsl approaches require clean manually annotated samples for them to work properly their performance gain and practicality are heavily overestimated our concrete recommendations for future work are as follows first report the model selection criteria for example report if the model selection is done via clean validation samples second wsl approaches should be compared with full supervised learning baselines as both work on clean samples third continuous fine-tuning is a simple yet strong baseline that should be considered in future work in wsl finally we have open source our code you can find it via the qr code on this slide please feel free to check it out thank you and enjoy the conference</sample>
    <sample id="340">hello everyone i'm guanhao huang from uca i'm presenting our work para mr a large-scale syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset by amr back-translation this is a jointed work with veron ihong anup kaiwei and aran then we propose to use amr back-translation to generate syntactically diverse paraphrases first we will use the pre-trained amr parser to get amr graph of a source sentence then we will change the focus of the graph we will randomly sample a node and set it as a new root node then modify the corresponding age and the edge able then we will use the amr graph to text generator to generate text from the modified graph for the generated text because they share the same amr graph structure so they will have similar semantics also because the generator text generator can perform better than other dataset in sas testing benchmark for the second application we consider syntactic control paraphrase generation we show that by training with para mr we can get a paraphrase generator that has better syntactic control finally we consider using paraphrase generator to generate paraphrases for data augmentation for future learning since para mr is more syntactically diverse we observe that para mr can get a higher score for future learning here is the conclusion of our work in this work we propose para mr a large-scale syntactically diverse paraphrase dataset which is constructed by amr back-translation and we show that para mr benefit several nlp applications compared to existing paraphrase dataset our dataset is available at this link thank you</sample>
    <sample id="341">hi i'm sarah papi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald negri and marco turci and what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simultaneous st use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the cross attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the attention is not concentrated that is if the sum is below a certain threshold alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross attention weights we will see that no words point to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted while since the sum of the cross attention is above the threshold alpha we will not emit the last word and we wait for another speech chunk if we go on and we receive another speech chunk and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross attention weights we will see that

and shanghai ai here is the outline of my presentation first part is introduction with the open-domain dialogue which means a type of conventional exchange between a human and an artificial intelligence system that can cover a range of topics and doesn't have a specific goal which relies on pre-trained models and the large-scale dataset left chat can be categorized into two parts the first one is a basic profile by manual labeling and scratching the second one is a detailed profile we extract them by rules and train a personalized classifier the personalized extraction of left chat can be categorized into two parts the first one is a basic profile by manual labeling and scratching the second one is a detailed profile we extract them by rules and train a personalized classifier in conclusion we propose left chat a chinese video-sourced and personalized dialogue dataset experimental on two benchmark tasks showed that our personalized is beneficial to the final

the shots gradually increase however when the number of demonstrations exceeds it shows the performance of the ams slightly decreased due to the random manual selection of demonstrations which mainly

    <sample id="343">hallo everyone i'm makshatta and today my co-author martin and i are presenting our work the kitmos task evaluating knowledge integration from multiple sources this work is a collaboration between mcgill university mila and microsoft research natural language understanding models draw on a variety of knowledge sources such as knowledge contained in their parameters usually acquired via pre-training and knowledge given in inputs at inference time in this work we propose a diagnostic test suite for knowledge integration we introduce a co-reference resolution task designed to probe for the ability to draw on knowledge available in different sources we evaluate the dataset with human study participants and established co-reference resolution models to summarize the main takeaways of our paper many co-reference resolution models appear unable to reason over knowledge from different sources without task-specific training however with task-specific training some models successfully integrate knowledge from multiple sources still even the best-performing models seem to have difficulties with reliably integrating background knowledge presented only at inference time if you're interested in more details please see our paper and check out the dataset and code on github thanks for listening</sample>

    <sample id="346">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 let's get started our paper investigated the problem of generalization using the named entity recognition task or the ner task we observed that models have been used in conno 2003 to develop ner for almost 20 years and this naturally raises several problems firstly can these models generalize to modern data and when we develop new taggers what is needed for good generalization at the same time if we all know that the number of fine-tuning examples directly affects the performance of a downstream task here we also found that more fine-tuning examples actually also lead to better generalization and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we did an experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="347">hi i'm myra and today i'll be talking about our paper marked personas using natural language prompts to measure stereotypes in language models this work is done in collaboration with essem dermanush and dan juravsky in recent years many have documented the prevalence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models or lls however these measures have various limitations they usually rely on hand-constructed datasets that are very time-consuming to curate and they also usually only measure very specific stereotypes meaning that they don't generalize well to other demographics or contexts or they simply capture very general broad associations like negative associations with particular groups so for instance the word man or sorry the word warrior is usually associated with men so when people are describing a warrior who is a woman they'll usually actually specify woman warrior and mark the term with woman and more broadly dominant groups in society are both linguistically and socially unmarked while the marginalized groups are usually marked so in our method we first designate what the unmarked and marked groups are and then we compare the personas using the fighting words method which is basically using weighted log odds ratios to distinguish the top words for each marked group so for instance for the personas of black women we see that some of the top words are things like culture tradition proud and exotic and these words define these groups only by their relationship to their identity and distinguish them as different from the white norm this contributes to a long legacy of discrimination and othering for these groups furthermore there's a lot of common tropes that are reflected in these words especially for women of color so for example the words describing latina women include things like vibrant and curvaceous which connect to a trope of tropicalism for asian women the words are things like petite and delicate and silky which connects to a long history of asian women being hypersexualized seen as very docile and submissive and so on and finally for black women we see that some of the top words are things like strong and resilient this connects to an archetype that people have called the strong black woman archetype and while it sounds like positive at first glance there's been work showing that this kind of archetype actually is very harmful because it puts a lot of pressure on these people to be resilient and strong against societal obstacles so rather than actually working towards changing those obstacles it puts pressure on those people to overcome them which leads to very negative health outcomes for these people among other harms more broadly we find that the words for each marked group pretty much just reflect very essentializing narratives so based on these patterns we conclude with three recommendations for model owners first we should as researchers be addressing positive stereotypes and essentializing narratives we should also be using an intersectional lens to study biases and harms because there's a lot of things that might be overlooked if we don't do that and finally there should really be increased transparency about bias mitigation methods because for instance like these positive stereotypes we don't know if it's because there's some sort of like weird overly excessive value alignment going on or maybe some other like anti-stereotyping methods that are resulting in these pernicious patterns we just really can't make any assumptions or really study that further without more transparency thank you so much for listening have a good time at acl</sample>

    <sample id="349">hello everyone my name is jingwei yi from the university of science and technology of china it's my pleasure to give a short advertisement video of our paper i will copy my model protecting the copyright of embedding as services via backdoor watermark let's first introduce the background about embedding as services currently large language models such as t5 lama palm are exceptional in natural language understanding and generation embedding as services is one of the services built upon large language models to assist various nlp tasks for example openai offers a t5 based embedding as service however recent works have shown that the attacker may steal the model through learning from the embedding as services therefore it's necessary to protect the copyright of embedding as services to protect the copyright of embedding as services one of the solutions is to embed a watermark in the provider service and detect whether another service contains the watermark the watermark method needs to meet the following properties first the method should be applicable to embedding as services second the watermark should not degrade the utility of the provided embedding as services third the watermark should be covert enough to the attacker or the attacker can remove the watermark easily finally the watermark needs to be transferable to the attacker's services during the model extraction process existing works can be broadly classified into four categories however these methods either are not applicable to embedding as services or lack transferability therefore in this paper we propose a backdoor-based watermark method applicable to embedding as services now let me introduce the details of our embedding watermark the embedding watermark contains two main steps watermark injection and copyright verification before these main steps we first select a trigger set the trigger set is a group of words in a moderate frequency interval we assume the provider can collect a general text corpus and count the word frequency with it the legends of the figures means the number of triggers in each sentence as shown in the figures it's hard to distinguish between the backdoor embedding and normal embeddings that's all thank you welcome to discuss with us</sample>
    <sample id="350">hello everyone and welcome to the presentation of our paper entitled what's the meaning of superhuman performance in today's nlu and similar to this and this is a joint work with several renowned researchers spanning many institutions around the world so in the last five years leaderboard-based evaluation became the de facto standard in nlu and consequently the main objective became to reach the top spot in popular benchmarks not infrequently it happens that systems achieve human-level or even superhuman performance in such benchmarks and we call these benchmarks saturated benchmarks and these achievements quickly spread in the research community and outside however by manually inspecting these datasets we discovered several sources of error that make the comparison between humans and systems unfair the first glaring mistake is that systems and humans are evaluated on different datasets in particular humans are almost always evaluated on a small or very small subset of the actual test set for instance on boolq systems are evaluated on the full test set made of more than 3000 instances while humans are evaluated on a small subset of just 100 instances additionally we also discovered that details about the annotator pool are often omitted specifically it's often unknown how many annotators were hired following what process what is their cultural background and so on and without all this information we argue that datasets constructed under these conditions should not be used for that kind of human to system comparisons finally along the same lines we also discovered that details about the annotator pool are often omitted specifically it's often unknown how many annotators were hired following what process what is their cultural background and so on and without all this information we argue that claims about superhuman performance are not scientifically meaningful so to summarize in this presentation we discuss the meaning of superhuman performance in nlu and explain why such claims are not yet grounded read our paper if you want to know more about the consequences of the identified issues and in our paper we also provide recommendations to avoid repeating the same mistakes and construct more reliable benchmarks thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="351">hello everyone my name is xuhong today i'm going to present our paper do conno 2003 named entity taggers still work well in 2023 and last but not least we calculated the percentage change in f1 to assess the generalization of each model so what is needed for good generalization through our experiments we found that from the graph on the right the red best fit line has a gradient that is greater than one this means that every unit of improvement that we made on conno 2003 translates to more than one unit improvement on conno which means that there is no diminishing returns and this shows us that adaptive overfitting in this case is not observed so what about temporal drift then for temporal drift we didn't experiment to retrain or continue to pre-train some models with more recent data and we found that the performance degrades with larger temporal gap and this confirms our hypothesis that the main cause of the performance drop is temporal drift and kind of surprisingly it is not caused by adaptive overfitting even though conno 2003 has been used for over 20 years so going back to the question that we raised in the title of our paper do conno 2003 taggers still work in 2023 and we found that the answer is actually a resounding yes we hope our paper calls for more research on how to improve generalization of the models and lastly please make sure to check out our paper our data set and if you have any questions feel free to contact me thank you so much</sample>
    <sample id="352">hello i'm james finch and i'm sarah finch and today we'll tell you all about abc eval a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational ai this work was done by the emory nlp lab led by professor gino choi at emory university and in collaboration with amazon alexa ai so let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art the common practice is to use human evaluation such as by asking human judges to select which of two conversations is better or to rate conversations given a likert scale method however we believe there is a more precise and reliable strategy for dimensional dialogue evaluation our approach attempts to reduce the subjectivity of human evaluation by explicitly annotating whether or not each model response expresses certain behaviors such as responding with irrelevant information or contradicting itself or its partner hallucinating incorrect facts or violating common sense knowledge and when the model succeeds or fails to show empathy to determine what kind of evaluation is most effective we selected four state-of-the-art chat models and evaluated them on 100 human bot conversations per model using abc eval for comparison we also evaluated these conversations using three existing methods likert ratings on the turn level likert ratings on the dialogue level and dialogue level pairwise comparisons for each of the existing methods we collected evaluations on eight of the most commonly measured aspects of dialogue since this is the standard practice for evaluating chat models along multiple dimensions with the rapid pace of improvement in the field many of these error rates could see a decrease in new models released since our evaluation was conducted however this is all the more reason to pursue reliable and precise evaluation metrics for comparing models we hope abc eval can be leveraged by others in the field as a meaningful step in this direction and we look forward to seeing how conversational ai will advance in the coming months and years thank you for watching</sample>

    <sample id="355">hello my name is vasudha and i am a computer science phd candidate at stony brook university i would like to present our work accepted into acl 2023 as a long paper transfer learning for dissonance detection addressing the rare class challenge we begin by defining cognitive dissonance and why it is an important problem to study in language simply put cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent such as this example where a person states i know that cigarettes could kill me and then goes on to say i grabbed a couple of smokes after the meeting this belief and action are inconsistent and they are in dissonance further mentioning that i don't think i could keep my job without them justifies the second occurrence and they have a dissonance relationship since the initial model was not able to capture the dissonance class at all we start the cold start the active learning process by transferring weights from closely related tasks topic independent dissonance stance classification a task that determines if two debate statements from different people are in agreement or in disagreement irrespective of topic called debate here and on binary classification of expansion and comparison classes of prt since these two are closely related to the conception of consonance and dissonance and we call them prc here we find that on transferring the zero shot performance on the annotated dataset is already much better than chance with the best with auc 075 which is the best performance that we have on the task so far we also check the feasibility of each strategy for annotation quality and costs to annotators we find that prc has the highest percentage of dissonance and works best for rare class however the annotators also find the examples difficult in summary we find that prc is a simple ael strategy for rare class acquisition and cold starting ael with appropriately designed transfer learning tasks can help significantly we also find that iterative update is useful for transfer learning from a different domain whereas in-domain active annotations benefit from cumulative update these are the links to our code dataset and our paper feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions thank you</sample>
    <sample id="356">hi my name is matthias linderman and today i'm going to give you a brief introduction to our paper on compositional generalization without trees using multiset tagging and latent permutations this is joint work with my advisors alexander koller and ivan titov compositional generalization can be understood as the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions of phrases that have been seen individually during training in the context of semantic parsing testing for compositional generalization might look like this as usual we have a training set of utterances in this case the girl slept and mary knew that the girl slept this works well but trees are usually not given and need to be obtained somehow this can be complicated and sometimes a computationally expensive process typically this involves considerable formalism-specific pre-processing of the logical forms for example to handle variable symbols obtaining trees may also involve specialized grammar induction procedures in this paper we solve a couple of interesting technical challenges first of all the alignment between input and output is not given in the training data as a consequence for a given token we don't know which multiset it came from which poses a challenge for training in addition sometimes there are multiple permutations that are consistent with the data but the linguistically correct one is latent we address this by inducing the alignment as part of the training our permutation method is very flexible but it brings the challenge that finding the highest scoring permutation is np-hard that's because this is related to the traveling salesman problem we approximate this with a gpu-friendly continuous relaxation that also allows us to back-propagate through the solution and learn the linguistically more plausible permutations if you want to learn more about our experiments and how we address these challenges please have a look at our paper or come to our poster</sample>
    <sample id="357">hi i'm xia jie from fudan university i'm here to introduce our work distinguishing script knowledge from language models for constraint language planning in everyday life humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripted knowledge previous work has explored language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities such as make a cake and showed that large language models can effectively decompose those into steps however previous work mainly focuses on planning for abstract goals with specific goals specific constraints such as make a chocolate cake still remains understudied in this paper we define the problem of constraint language planning which imposes different constraints on the goals of planning an abstract goal can be represented by different real-life specific goals with multiple specific constraints we apply our method for building a dataset of constraint language planning named as co-script we generate a high-quality dataset co-script for constraint language planning we hope co-script dataset can be a valuable resource to advance research on language planning thanks for your time please find more details of co-script in our paper</sample>
    <sample id="358">so now we use our findings from our analysis to design a benchmark for document-level translation for each of the five discourse phenomena we identified we create tags to automatically identify words that pertain to the phenomenon and we call our tagger the multilingual discourse-aware or muda tagger we can then also note that different languages have different proportions of these discourse phenomena we then use the muda tagger by applying the tagger on the parallel corpus that we want to use for evaluation and we apply our translation metrics of choice on the context-dependent examples that the muda tagger has identified and finally we use our benchmark as well as other metrics to evaluate models on the document-level translation system if we use corpus-level metrics alone now we use the muda benchmark to evaluate models and we find that context-aware models are significantly more accurate than models that do not use context on other phenomena like ellipsis pronouns and verb form so this sort of suggests where we would need to see more progress for document-level translation to summarize we perform a data-driven analysis across 14 language pairs to identify when translations require context and then we use our findings to build a benchmark for document-level machine translation which can help us identify which discourse phenomena models can handle well or not and which translation systems are good at document-level translation thank you so much for your attention see you in toronto</sample>
    <sample id="359">hi i'm sarah pappi from the university of toronto and vlad seleny bruno kessler and i will briefly introduce the attention as a guide for simultaneous speech translation paper that is a joint work with macdonald and marco turci and what is simultaneous speech translation simulst is the process of translating spoken language into text in another language in real time enabling cross-language communication and what are the problems of the current simulst models specific architectures are usually trained introducing additional modules to be optimized long and complicated training procedures for example training involving different optimization objectives and training and maintaining several models to reach different latency regimes for example training a model with an average of one second latency and another one with two seconds latency and so on so what is our solution first two use already existing offline st models without retraining or adopting specific architecture for simulst use only one model for every latency regime and handle latency through specific specific parameters and leverage the knowledge already acquired by the model through the tension mechanism between audio input and textual output that is the cross-attention mechanism and you can see an example on the right our solution is to propose a dot or encoder-decoder attention and it is a strategy for which we decide whether to emit or not a partial translation based on where attention points to and what is emitted if the tension is not concentrated that is if the alpha towards the last lambda speech frames meaning that the received information is unstable for example if we receive a speech chunk containing i'm going to talk about and our model predicts other three words and we will look at the cross-attention weights we will see that no word points to lambda lambda lambda speech frames this means that these three words will be emitted if we look at the main results of the dot we will plot the simultaneous speech translation results on graphs in which we have blue on one side that measures the translation quality and average lagging that is the latency measure and we also consider the computational aware lagging that accounts for the model's computational time to predict the output so we want our curves to be as high as possible on this plot and we also see that if we consider the actual elapse time or the computational aware time that is the fastest strategy if you want to discover more results read our paper and we also released open source the code and models and simultaneous output to facilitate the reproducibility of our work thanks for your attention</sample>
    <sample id="361">hi my name is armina norbach i'm a phd student at the language technologies institute at carnegie mellon university i'm also a research director at the jp morgan ai research team the work i'm presenting today is titled countercomp and is focused on using counterfactual scenarios to improve compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning by multi-step quantitative reasoning we're specifically focused on the question answering task so if you're given a financial table such as the one displayed on the right hand side of this slide you'd be able to ask different questions about the data in this table for instance you could ask what was the net change in revenue from 2019 to 2020 and the answer would be a certain number that's derived from executing one or more arithmetic operations and this is what we mean by multi-step quantitative reasoning we show that adding this auxiliary metric learning loss to the training procedure and that auxiliary metric learning loss has a dynamic margin that is actually measuring the extent of change or intervention in the questions between each pair and using that to adjust the metric learning loss accordingly we show that adding the auxiliary loss to three state-of-the-art baselines consistently improves their performance especially when the number of reasoning steps grows beyond two this is performance on in-distribution samples meaning the model is trained on one dataset and tested on the same dataset but more importantly we also show qualitatively that adding the countercomp loss helps the model attend to more meaningful tokens during training meaningful in the sense that they relate to more meaningful operational terms in the output here is the base main references used in this presentation for more information make sure to check out our poster or if you have any questions feel free to reach out to the contact listed here i'd like to thank my co-authors my advisor at cmu and my co-advisor at jp morgan and i would like to thank you all</sample>
