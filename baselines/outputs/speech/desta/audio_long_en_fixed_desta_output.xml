This paper presents a novel approach to detecting cognitive dissonance in language, a phenomenon where two beliefs or actions conflict with each other, leading to psychological discomfort. The authors, Vasudha and colleagues, argue that dissonance detection is crucial in understanding human behavior, as it can reveal underlying biases, inconsistencies, and potential mental health issues. The researchers propose a transfer learning framework to address the rare class challenge of dissonance detection, where the majority of language data is not dissonant. They define dissonance as a mismatch between a person's beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors, and the consequences of those beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. The proposed approach leverages pre-trained language models and fine-tunes them on a dissonance-annotated dataset. The results show significant improvement in dissonance detection accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the transfer learning framework. This work has implications for applications in natural language processing, psychology, and mental health, enabling the development of systems that can identify and address dissonance in human language and behavior.</sample>

    <sample id="118">The speaker introduces their ACL 2020 submission, focusing on improving pre-training techniques for code-switched NLP. Code-switching refers to the mixing of languages, such as English and Hindi, in a single sentence, which is prevalent in linguistically diverse communities like India. The speaker provides an example of a code-switched sentence, "laptop mirror bag mirror," which combines English and Hindi words. The goal is to develop computational models for code-switched language processing, as it is essential for effective communication in multilingual environments. The speaker aims to improve pre-training techniques to better handle code-switched text, which can be challenging due to the unique characteristics of code-switched language, such as the blending of linguistic rules and grammatical structures from different languages. The proposed approach aims to enhance the performance of NLP models on code-switched text, enabling more accurate and effective processing of multilingual data.</sample>

    <sample id="123">This research presentation introduces the concept of multi-instruct, a novel approach to improve multi-model aerosol learning while instruction tuning. With the advancement of large language models, researchers have explored new learning paradigms for reusing pre-trained models for downstream tasks in a parameter- and data-efficient manner. Instruction tuning has been shown to be effective in fine-tuning language models for specific tasks. The presenters, Yin and Zhiyang, aim to improve this process by developing a multi-instruct framework. This framework allows for the reuse of pre-trained language models across multiple tasks, reducing the need for extensive retraining and data collection. The research focuses on the benefits of multi-instruct, including improved model performance, reduced computational resources, and increased adaptability. The presentation will discuss the methodology, results, and implications of this innovative approach, which has the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing and machine learning.</sample>
    <sample id="124">Tan Chi-Yi from the National University of Singapore at Alibaba presents research on improving the temporal reasoning capability of Artificial Language Models (ALMs). The team breaks down temporal reasoning into three levels: time-to-time reasoning, time-to-event reasoning, and event-to-event reasoning. The first level, time-to-time reasoning, involves understanding the relationship between two specific points in time, such as determining what year comes after 2010. This requires only basic knowledge of the time axis. The researchers aim to develop an ALM that can accurately answer such questions, which is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. The development of this capability will enable ALMs to better understand and interact with humans, particularly in scenarios where time is a crucial factor, such as scheduling, planning, and decision-making. The research has significant implications for the advancement of AI and its applications in various domains, including natural language processing, robotics, and human-computer interaction.</sample>

    <sample id="127">This presentation introduces a joint research project by Nam Gyu-ho, Laura Schmidt, and Se-yeong Yoon, exploring the limitations of the Chain of Thought reasoning technique in large language models. The technique, originally designed for complex task-solving, is typically applied to massive models like GPT-3 and POM. The researchers aim to address this limitation by developing a new approach that enables Chain of Thought reasoning in smaller models. The proposed solution involves a novel architecture that combines a reasoning teacher with a large language model, allowing smaller models to mimic the reasoning capabilities of larger ones. The paper presents a summary of the project's objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. The research aims to improve the efficiency and scalability of Chain of Thought reasoning, enabling smaller models to tackle complex tasks previously reserved for larger models. The project has the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing and machine learning, making it more accessible and practical for a wider range of applications.</sample>
    <sample id="128">The KITMAS test is a novel evaluation framework designed to assess the ability of artificial intelligence models to integrate knowledge from multiple sources. Developed by a collaboration between McGill University, Mela, and Microsoft Research, the test aims to simulate real-world scenarios where machines must combine information from diverse sources to make informed decisions. The KITMAS test comprises a series of tasks that challenge AI models to integrate knowledge from various sources, including text, images, and structured data. The test is designed to evaluate the models' ability to recognize the relationships between different sources, identify inconsistencies, and adapt to changing information. The KITMAS test is a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of AI systems in real-world applications, such as question-answering, information retrieval, and decision-making. By providing a comprehensive assessment of a model's ability to integrate knowledge from multiple sources, the KITMAS test can help developers improve the accuracy and reliability of AI systems, ultimately leading to more effective decision-making and better outcomes.</sample>

    <sample id="135">James Finch and Sarah Finch introduce ABC eval, a novel approach to evaluating conversational AI developed by the Emory NLP Lab in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. The traditional method of evaluating dialogue models involves human evaluation, which can be time-consuming and expensive. ABC eval aims to provide a more efficient and accurate way to assess the performance of conversational AI systems. The approach uses a dimensional framework to evaluate the quality of conversations, considering aspects such as fluency, coherence, engagement, and overall user satisfaction. The system is designed to analyze the dialogue and provide a comprehensive evaluation report, allowing developers to identify areas for improvement and optimize their models. The ABC eval approach has the potential to revolutionize the way conversational AI is evaluated, enabling more effective development and deployment of intelligent conversational systems.</sample>
    <sample id="136">The speaker, Jazavan, presents his research on Firmat, an alternative to accuracy for numerical reasoning, in collaboration with his supervisor Nefisa at the University of Sheffield. The work aims to address the limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in numerical reasoning tasks, which are often insufficient for real-world applications. The motivation behind this research is to develop a more effective evaluation metric that can accurately assess the performance of models in downstream tasks that require factual correctness. The speaker notes that numerical reasoning is crucial in various real-world applications, including data analysis, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence. The proposed solution, Firmat, is designed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of numerical reasoning models by considering not only accuracy but also other relevant aspects, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The speaker invites the audience to access the paper, GitHub repository, and his social media profiles for more information.</sample>
    <sample id="137">The research, "Tell-To Design," presented by Sissong from the Singapore University of Technology and Design, focuses on developing a data cell for language-guided floor plan generation. The study builds upon recent advancements in conditional generative AI models, which have shown impressive results in generating realistic and creative images from sentence-level descriptions. However, these models primarily focus on understanding high-level visual concepts, neglecting the need for more specific and detailed designs. The Tell-To Design data cell aims to bridge this gap by leveraging natural language processing and computer vision techniques to generate floor plans from text-based descriptions. The system takes a sentence-level input and generates a corresponding 2D floor plan, considering factors such as room layout, furniture placement, and spatial relationships. The proposed approach has the potential to revolutionize the design process by enabling architects and designers to quickly and efficiently create floor plans based on text-based specifications.</sample>

Dialogue summarization is a subtask of text summarization that aims to create a concise summary of the most important information within a dialogue. The speaker highlights various scenarios in dialogue summarization, including the importance of identifying and addressing omissions in the summarization process. Omissions refer to the information that is intentionally or unintentionally left out of the summary, which can significantly impact the accuracy and effectiveness of the summary. The talk presents an analysis of omission in dialogue summarization, focusing on the identification and evaluation of omissions in different dialogue summarization scenarios. The speaker aims to provide insights into the importance of addressing omissions in dialogue summarization and to explore potential solutions to mitigate the impact of omissions on the summarization process.</sample>

    <sample id="150">The paper presents a novel approach to meeting QA, extractive question answering on meeting transcripts. With millions of meetings taking place daily, meeting transcripts offer a vast new domain for NLP research. The unique aspects of this domain include the presence of contextual information, speaker identification, and the ability to capture nuances in human communication. The proposed method leverages these characteristics to extract relevant information and answer questions about the meeting. The approach involves three main components: meeting transcript processing, question analysis, and answer generation. Meeting transcript processing involves identifying speakers, detecting entities, and extracting relevant information. Question analysis involves identifying the intent and scope of the question. Answer generation uses the extracted information to provide an answer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of meeting transcripts and shows promising results. The paper concludes by discussing the potential applications of this technology, such as improving meeting summarization and enabling more efficient meeting participation.</sample>

The presentation aims to provide an overview of the current landscape of language models and their relevance to classical studies.</sample>
    <sample id="153">Nina Rehmehrabi, a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon Alexa AI's responsible AI team, presents a study on resolving ambiguities in text-to-image generative models. The research focuses on the existing ambiguities in prompts provided to these models, which can lead to varying interpretations. The team explores two examples of ambiguous prompts: "a girl" and "a house with a garden." These prompts can be open to multiple interpretations, resulting in diverse image generations. The study aims to address this issue by developing a novel method to disambiguate the prompts and generate more accurate images. The proposed approach involves identifying the most likely interpretation of the prompt and generating an image based on that interpretation. The method is evaluated on a large-scale dataset, demonstrating improved performance in generating accurate images compared to existing models. The study contributes to the development of more reliable and accurate text-to-image generation models, which can have significant implications for applications such as visual storytelling, art generation, and product design.</sample>

    <sample id="157">The researchers from San Dong University present their work on Dialogue Summarization with Static Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph, a joint effort with six collaborators. The goal of dialogue summarization is to extract essential information from a conversation and condense it into a concise summary. The proposed approach combines static and dynamic structures to model the dialogue context. The static structure represents the dialogue's syntax and semantics, while the dynamic structure captures the evolving relationships between entities and events. The fusion of these two structures enables the model to effectively identify the most important information and generate a coherent summary. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on a large-scale dialogue dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of summary quality and fluency. The proposed method has potential applications in various areas, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and natural language processing.</sample>
    <sample id="158">Xiang Guanhu from AWS introduces a dual cache approach for long document neural coreference resolution. Coreference resolution is a task that identifies and clusters mentions of entities across a text, which can have multiple mentions. The goal is to determine which mentions refer to the same entity. The traditional approach to coreference resolution involves sequential processing, which can be computationally expensive and inefficient for long documents. To address this, the proposed dual cache approach uses two caches: a mention cache and a cluster cache. The mention cache stores the mention representations and their corresponding entity IDs, while the cluster cache stores the cluster representations and their corresponding entity IDs. This dual cache approach enables efficient processing of long documents by reducing the number of computations required. The approach also allows for parallel processing of mentions and clusters, further improving efficiency. The proposed method is expected to improve the performance and efficiency of coreference resolution for long documents.</sample>

    <sample id="227">Recent advancements in language models have led to significant success in various NLP tasks. However, a crucial aspect is still lacking: grounded language understanding. This concept involves translating natural language expressions into executable plans or programs that can be applied to a specific environment. The goal is to bridge the gap between language understanding and real-world execution. Current language models excel in processing and generating human language, but struggle to connect this understanding to tangible actions. To achieve grounded language understanding, researchers need to develop models that can comprehend the context, intent, and constraints of a language expression and generate a corresponding plan or program that can be executed in a specific environment. This requires integrating multiple AI disciplines, including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and cognitive science. By achieving grounded language understanding, language models can move beyond mere text processing and enable human-like interactions with the physical world, revolutionizing applications such as human-robot collaboration, intelligent assistants, and autonomous systems.</sample>

    <sample id="241">This paper presents a case study on human-in-the-loop evaluation for early misinformation detection in the context of COVID-19 treatments. The authors, Ethan and his co-authors, identify two key limitations in existing approaches to automatically detecting misinformation on social media platforms. Firstly, these systems are often unrealistically evaluated, lacking real-world scenarios and human oversight. Secondly, they fail to account for the complexities of human decision-making and the nuances of social media platforms. To address these limitations, the authors propose a human-in-the-loop evaluation framework, which integrates human judgment and feedback into the evaluation process. This approach enables a more accurate assessment of misinformation detection systems and can help improve their performance in real-world settings. The case study focuses on COVID-19 treatments, highlighting the importance of accurate information dissemination during public health crises. By combining human expertise with machine learning algorithms, the authors aim to develop more effective and reliable misinformation detection systems.</sample>

The traditional methods for this task rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated corpora, which can be time-consuming and expensive to create. The proposed certainty-guided level denoising method addresses this limitation by introducing a new framework that leverages the uncertainty of the extracted relations to refine the extraction process. The approach uses a probabilistic model to estimate the uncertainty of each extracted relation, and then employs a denoising technique to remove noisy or uncertain relations. This allows the model to focus on the most reliable and informative relations, improving the overall accuracy of the extraction task. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a higher F1-score and precision. The research has potential applications in various NLP tasks, such as information retrieval, question answering, and text summarization.</sample>

The framework, Multi-Emo, is designed to be attention-based and coordination-aware, allowing it to effectively fuse information from different modalities. The framework consists of several components, including a feature extractor, an attention mechanism, and a fusion module. The feature extractor extracts relevant features from the input data, while the attention mechanism selectively focuses on the most relevant features for each utterance. The fusion module combines the extracted features and attention weights to generate the final emotion representation. The framework is trained using a multi-task learning approach, where it learns to predict the emotion label of each utterance and other relevant tasks, such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling. The results show that Multi-Emo outperforms state-of-the-art models in emotion regulation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in fusing information from multiple modalities and capturing complex emotional dynamics in conversations.</sample>
    <sample id="281">The presentation "When does translation require context?" explores the importance of context in translation, using a data-driven approach to examine multilingual texts. The authors, Kaio Yin and collaborators, highlight that many translations rely on context to convey meaning accurately. They provide an example of a sentence, "More in this sentence," which can have different meanings depending on the preceding sentence. If the previous sentence is "Things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out," then "more" likely refers to a slide, indicating a potentially dangerous situation. The authors aim to investigate when context is crucial in translation, using a dataset of multilingual texts to identify patterns and trends. The study aims to provide insights into how context affects translation, enabling more accurate and effective communication across languages and cultures. By understanding when context is essential, the authors hope to improve translation quality and facilitate more precise communication in a globalized world.</sample>
    <sample id="282">Xue Kai-Ju presents a new work on non-parallel story style transfer in SL 2023. The research focuses on addressing the task of natural language generation, specifically non-parallel text style transfer. Most previous studies have concentrated on token-level or sentence-level transformations, such as sentiment transfer. In contrast, this work aims to enhance the course representation of the story by introducing a non-parallel style transfer approach. This method enables the transformation of a source story into a target story with a distinct style, while preserving the original meaning and coherence. The proposed approach leverages a novel architecture that integrates multiple components, including a style encoder, a content encoder, and a decoder. The style encoder is designed to capture the stylistic features of the target story, while the content encoder is responsible for generating the story content. The decoder then combines the style and content representations to produce the transformed story. The proposed method demonstrates improved performance on a range of benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in generating coherent and stylistically transformed stories.</sample>

    <sample id="284">Peng Pian Shuo, a researcher from Wuhan University, presents a novel approach to universal information extraction, dubbed SSUIE. The current state-of-the-art method, SBAN-based UI models, relies on identifying and labeling the boundaries of target entities in text, which can be computationally expensive and inaccurate. SSUIE addresses this limitation by introducing a few-shot learning mechanism that enables the model to learn from a small number of labeled examples and adapt to new domains. This approach leverages a novel few-shot learning framework, which allows the model to generalize well to unseen data. The proposed method consists of two main components: a few-shot learner and a universal information extractor. The few-shot learner is responsible for learning the target boundaries from a small set of labeled examples, while the universal information extractor extracts relevant information from the text. The proposed approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Overall, SSUIE offers a promising solution for universal information extraction, enabling more accurate and efficient processing of unstructured text data.</sample>
