    <sample id="6">Here is a summary of the given English content in approximately 400 words:

The speaker, Zhang, presents a joint work with several colleagues to unify multilingual and cross-lingual summarization, a task called many-to-many summarization. They unify the two tasks by treating them as a single problem, where the goal is to generate summaries for multiple languages and multiple sources. The approach is based on a single model that can handle multiple languages and sources, rather than training separate models for each language or source.

The many-to-many summarization model uses a encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder takes in the input text and the decoder generates the summary. The model is trained on a dataset that includes multiple languages and sources, and the objective is to maximize the similarity between the generated summary and the reference summary.

The model is evaluated on several benchmarks, including the Multi30k dataset, which contains summaries in multiple languages. The results show that the many-to-many summarization model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on most metrics, including ROUGE and METEOR.

The model is also evaluated on a cross-lingual summarization task, where the input text is in one language and the summary is generated in another language. The results show that the model can generate high-quality summaries in the target language, even when the input text is in a different language.

Overall, the many-to-many summarization model has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of summarization systems, particularly in scenarios where multiple languages and sources are involved.</sample>

Shen Zhongwu, a PhD student in AOS, introduces their work on multimodal relation extraction. Relation extraction is a well-studied task that aims to identify the semantic relationship between entities in a given text. However, in real-world scenarios, such as social media, the data often comes in various forms and modalities, including text, images, videos, and audio. This makes traditional text-based relation extraction approaches insufficient.

To address this challenge, Shen Zhongwu's work focuses on multimodal relation extraction, which involves extracting relationships between entities from multiple modalities. The approach combines computer vision and natural language processing techniques to leverage the strengths of each modality. For instance, images can provide visual cues, while text can provide contextual information.

The proposed method involves several steps. First, it extracts features from each modality using relevant techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for images and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for text. Then, it aligns the features across modalities using attention mechanisms to identify the most relevant information. Finally, it applies a classification layer to predict the semantic relationship between entities.

The proposed approach demonstrates promising results on a social media dataset, achieving improved accuracy compared to traditional text-based methods. The work highlights the potential of multimodal relation extraction in real-world applications, such as sentiment analysis, event detection, and information retrieval.</sample>

John Sucho, a master student from Shenzhen University, is thrilled to present their work on Survey for Efficient Open Domain Question Answering, which has been accepted by ACL 2023. The work focuses on Open Domain Question Answering, a mainstream framework proposed by a two-stage model. The model consists of a knowledge base and a question answering module. The knowledge base is responsible for generating a set of candidate answers, while the question answering module selects the most relevant answer from the candidates.

The authors propose a novel approach to improve the efficiency of the two-stage model. They introduce a new method to reduce the search space of the knowledge base, which significantly accelerates the process. Additionally, they design a novel attention mechanism to enhance the question answering module, allowing it to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge base.

The authors evaluate their approach on several benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. They demonstrate that their method can efficiently answer open-domain questions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the computational cost while maintaining the accuracy of the answers.

The authors conclude that their work has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of open-domain question answering systems, making them more practical for real-world applications. They believe that their approach can be applied to various domains, such as customer service, information retrieval, and language translation.</sample>

Vasudha, a PhD candidate in computer science at Stony Brook University, is presenting a long paper on "Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection" at ACL 2023. The paper addresses the rare class challenge of detecting cognitive dissonance in language. Cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort or tension that arises when an individual holds two or more conflicting beliefs, values, or actions. This phenomenon is significant to study because it can lead to negative emotions, changes in behavior, and even mental health issues.

The researchers aim to develop a machine learning model that can identify dissonance in text data, which is a challenging task due to the rarity of dissonant instances. They propose a transfer learning approach, leveraging pre-trained language models to adapt to the dissonance detection task. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data and fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of labeled dissonant and non-dissonant texts.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by evaluating the model on a benchmark dataset and achieving state-of-the-art results. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms baseline models, indicating its potential for real-world applications in areas such as natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and social media monitoring.

The study's findings have implications for understanding human behavior and mental health, as well as the development of AI systems that can detect and respond to dissonant language. The research contributes to the growing field of affective computing, which aims to develop machines that can recognize and understand human emotions.</sample>

Ntai Kaldaron, the author of an ACL paper, introduces a systematic study on Nord distillation for natural language generation with pseudo-target training. This collaborative effort involved Amir and Subha from Microsoft and Ntai's PhD advisor, Roy. The study focuses on natural language generation systems, which rely on large language models. As these models become larger, more complex, and slower, they also become more costly. To address this issue, the authors propose Nord distillation, a technique that distills knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. This approach enables the student model to learn from the teacher model's knowledge without requiring significant computational resources. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Nord distillation in several natural language processing tasks, including language translation and text summarization. The results show that the student model can achieve comparable performance to the teacher model while being significantly smaller and faster. This technique has the potential to improve the efficiency and scalability of natural language generation systems, making them more practical for real-world applications.</sample>

Shih-He introduces his paper "Pardonate: An Efficient Framework for Dynamic Networks" at ACL 2023. He begins by discussing the background knowledge of Dynamic Networks, which differ from traditional static networks in that they can adapt to changing input values. Traditional networks are designed to compute fixed outputs given fixed inputs, whereas Dynamic Networks can modify their behavior in response to changing inputs. This allows them to better model real-world scenarios where data is constantly evolving.

Shih-He highlights the limitations of existing methods for training Dynamic Networks, which often require complex architectures, large amounts of data, and significant computational resources. He then presents his proposed framework, Pardonate, which addresses these limitations by introducing a novel architecture that combines the strengths of both static and dynamic networks. Pardonate is designed to be efficient, scalable, and easy to train, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

The framework consists of two main components: a static network and a dynamic network. The static network provides a fixed base model that is trained on a large dataset, while the dynamic network adapts to changing input values by modifying the output of the static network. This allows Pardonate to balance the benefits of static and dynamic networks, achieving better performance and efficiency.

Shih-He concludes by discussing the experimental results of Pardonate, which demonstrate its effectiveness in various tasks, including natural language processing and computer vision. The results show that Pardonate outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and scalability, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.</sample>

The authors note that large language models are trained on massive amounts of data and are often used for various tasks such as language translation, text generation, and chatbots. However, these models are often copied and used without permission, which can lead to copyright infringement. The authors propose a method to embed a watermark or a digital fingerprint into the model, which can be used to identify the original creator of the model.

The authors also discuss the importance of protecting the intellectual property rights of large language models. They argue that protecting the rights of creators can encourage innovation and investment in the development of these models. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the proposed method can also be used to detect and prevent copyright infringement.

The authors conclude that the proposed method is a simple and effective way to protect the copyright of large language models for embedding and services. They believe that this method can help to promote the development of these models and encourage responsible use of intellectual property.</sample>

Multi-Hop QA is a type of question-answering task that requires multiple reasoning jumps to provide an accurate answer. Each jump typically corresponds to a document in the corpus. To answer a question, one needs to navigate through multiple steps, analyzing and processing information from different sources.

For instance, to answer the question "What 1988 Christmas comedy film did Brian Doyle-Murray star in?", one would need to first identify all the movies that Brian Doyle-Murray was involved in, and then find the film that was released in 1988. This requires a series of logical jumps, connecting each piece of information to the next, to arrive at the final answer.

This type of question-answering task is challenging because it demands a deep understanding of the relationships between different pieces of information, as well as the ability to recognize patterns and connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. It is also important to consider the context and relevance of each piece of information, to ensure that the answer is accurate and meaningful.

In the context of natural language processing, Multi-Hop QA can be achieved through the use of various techniques, such as graph-based models, attention mechanisms, and knowledge graph embeddings. These approaches enable machines to navigate complex networks of information, making connections between different pieces of data, and generating accurate answers to complex questions.</sample>

The speaker, Shetanya, introduces a research paper called Quest, collaborated with Pete, Mingwei, Kenton, and Christina from Google DeepMind. To illustrate the motivation behind the work, Shetanya presents two examples. The first example is about Jane, a zoologist on a field trip in Costa Rica, who encounters an unknown species of reptile. She wants to identify the species but lacks the necessary knowledge. The second example is similar, with a person trying to identify a rare plant in a forest.

The speaker then explains that these scenarios illustrate the challenges of knowledge discovery, where individuals need to navigate through vast amounts of information to find the correct answer. The paper Quest aims to address this problem by developing a system that can help users discover new knowledge by providing a personalized learning path. The system uses a combination of machine learning and knowledge graph techniques to identify the most relevant information and present it to the user in a structured and organized manner.

The speaker highlights that the Quest system can be applied to various domains, including science, education, and everyday life. For instance, a student can use Quest to learn about a new subject, or a researcher can use it to discover new connections between different concepts. The system can also be used to help people identify unknown species, like Jane the zoologist, or to discover new recipes, like a chef exploring a new cuisine. Overall, the Quest system aims to make knowledge discovery more efficient and enjoyable by providing a personalized and guided learning experience.</sample>

The speaker introduces their research on "Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Detention" at ACL 2023, representing the Neon Technology Co-University of Singapore. The speaker notes that large-language models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, allowing a single model to learn multiple tasks. However, these models often struggle with the trade-off between the number of parameters and the quality of the output.

The research aims to identify the "pillars of strength" that contribute to the success of these large-language models, with the goal of improving their performance. The team proposes a new approach to multi-head attention, which allows the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence. This is achieved by introducing a novel attention mechanism that adaptively adjusts the weights of the attention heads based on the input sequence.

The proposed approach is evaluated on several benchmark tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and text classification. The results show that the new approach outperforms state-of-the-art models on these tasks, with significant improvements in accuracy and fluency. The speaker concludes that the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of large-language models in various natural language processing tasks, and invites further research to explore its applications in other areas.</sample>

Yin and Zhiyang are presenting their research on multi-instruct, which aims to improve multi-model aerosol learning while tuning instructions. With the advancements in large language models, researchers have explored new learning paradigms that reuse pre-trained language models for various downstream tasks in a parameter- and data-efficient manner. Many studies have shown that instruction tuning enables large language models to adapt to specific tasks by fine-tuning a small set of parameters. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, such as language translation, question-answering, and text classification.

However, current instruction tuning methods have some limitations. They often require a large amount of labeled data and can be computationally expensive. Moreover, the performance of the fine-tuned models may not generalize well to unseen data. To address these limitations, Yin and Zhiyang propose a novel approach called multi-instruct, which involves fine-tuning multiple pre-trained language models simultaneously for multiple tasks. This approach can leverage the strengths of each model and improve the overall performance.

The authors also introduce a new technique called aerosol learning, which allows the models to learn from each other during the fine-tuning process. This technique can help to improve the robustness of the models and reduce the risk of overfitting. The experimental results show that multi-instruct outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in several NLP tasks, including language translation and text classification. The authors believe that their approach has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of instruction tuning in NLP tasks.</sample>

Tan Chi-Yi from the National University of Singapore at Alibaba discusses their work on benchmarking and improving the temporal reasoning capability of Artificial Language Models (ALMs). He emphasizes that time is a fundamental axis in the real world and that temporal reasoning is crucial for AI systems to understand. To tackle this challenge, they break down temporal reasoning into three levels. The first level is time-to-time reasoning, which involves answering questions like "What is a year after 2010?" that only require understanding of the time axis. This type of reasoning is a fundamental building block for more complex temporal reasoning tasks. The second level is time-to-event reasoning, which involves understanding the relationships between events in time, such as "What happened before/after a specific event?" The third level is event-to-event reasoning, which involves understanding the causal relationships between events, such as "What caused an event to happen?" The team aims to develop a comprehensive temporal reasoning framework that can handle these different levels of temporal reasoning.</sample>

Nam Gyu-ho, a master's student at KAIST AI in Korea, introduces his work on Large Language Models, a joint project with Laura Schmidt and Professor Se-yeong Yoon. The paper aims to improve the performance of large language models in solving complex tasks. The technique used is Chain of Thought, which was previously applied to large models such as GPT-3 and POM. However, Nam notes that this technique has limitations, as it is not suitable for smaller models.

The goal of the project is to extend the Chain of Thought technique to smaller models, making it more accessible to a wider range of applications. The team achieved this by introducing a new method called "Large Language Models, our reasoning teachers." This approach uses a combination of techniques, including self-attention and layer-wise reasoning, to enable smaller models to perform complex tasks.

The team's approach is based on the idea that smaller models can be trained to mimic the behavior of larger models by using a technique called "teacher-student" learning. In this approach, a larger model is used as a teacher to guide the training of a smaller model. The smaller model is trained to mimic the behavior of the teacher model, allowing it to learn complex tasks without requiring the same level of computational resources.

The results of the project show that the new approach is effective in improving the performance of smaller language models, enabling them to solve complex tasks with a significant reduction in computational resources. The team's work has the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing, making it possible to develop more efficient and effective language models that can be used in a wider range of applications.</sample>

Sissong from the Singapore University of Technology and Design introduces their research project, Tell-To Design, which focuses on generating floor plans guided by language. Recent advancements in conditional generative AI models have achieved impressive results in generating realistic and creative images from sentence-level descriptions. These models excel in understanding high-level visual concepts and can produce images that are both realistic and creative. However, they often overlook the importance of layout and spatial relationships in floor plans. Tell-To Design aims to address this limitation by developing a data cell that integrates natural language processing and computer vision techniques to generate floor plans from text-based descriptions. The system consists of two main components: a language-guided generator and a spatial layout generator. The language-guided generator uses a pre-trained language model to analyze the input text and generate a semantic graph, which represents the layout and spatial relationships between objects. The spatial layout generator then uses this graph to produce a floor plan that meets the specified requirements. The authors evaluate their system using a dataset of 1,000 floor plans and achieve promising results, demonstrating the potential of their approach in generating realistic and functional floor plans from text-based descriptions.</sample>

There are various scenarios in dialogue summarization, including summarizing conversations between humans, automated dialogue systems, and human-computer interactions.

Zhou then outlines the importance of understanding omission in dialogue summarization, as it is a crucial aspect of human communication. Omission refers to the intentional or unintentional exclusion of information in a dialogue, which can significantly impact the comprehension and interpretation of the conversation. The speaker highlights the challenges of identifying and addressing omission in dialogue summarization, as it requires a deep understanding of the context, speaker intentions, and the relationships between utterances.

The talk then shifts to the research methodology, which involves developing a novel approach to analyze omission in dialogue summarization. The approach incorporates machine learning techniques and natural language processing to identify and quantify omission in dialogue summaries.

She notes that millions of meetings take place daily worldwide, generating vast amounts of meeting transcripts that can be leveraged for NLP research. The meeting domain is unique and interesting due to its characteristics, such as the presence of multiple speakers, context-dependent language, and the need to identify relevant information from unstructured data. The paper proposes a novel approach to extractive question answering, which involves identifying relevant segments in meeting transcripts and generating questions based on the extracted information. The model uses a combination of techniques, including named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing, to identify relevant information and generate questions. The paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of the approach, such as the need to handle ambiguity, disfluencies, and the lack of labeled data.

Xun Gao from San Dong University introduces their research work on Dialogue Summization with Static Dynamic Structure Fusion Graph. The goal of dialogue summarization is to extract key information from a dialogue context and condense it into a concise summary. The team, consisting of Xing Cheng, Ming Zhe Li, Xiu Yong Chen, Jin Peng Li, Dong Yan Zhao, and Ray Yan, aims to develop a system that can effectively summarize dialogues.

The proposed approach combines static and dynamic structure fusion graphs to model the dialogue context. The static graph represents the conversation structure, while the dynamic graph captures the temporal relationships between turns. The fusion of these two graphs enables the system to capture both the overall conversation flow and the sequential dependencies between turns.

The system uses a neural network architecture to process the dialogue input and generate a summary. The network consists of an encoder that extracts features from the dialogue, a decoder that generates the summary, and an attention mechanism that focuses on the most relevant parts of the dialogue.

The team plans to evaluate their approach on various dialogue datasets and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods. The goal is to develop a system that can accurately and efficiently summarize dialogues, which has applications in various areas such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and human-computer interaction.</sample>

Xiang Guanhu from AWS introduces their work on dual cache for long document neural coreference resolution. Coreference resolution is a task that identifies and clusters mentions of entities in a document that refer to the same entity. The task is challenging due to the complexity of long documents, which can contain multiple mentions of the same entity across the text. Traditional methods rely on a single cache to store and retrieve mentions, but this can lead to inefficiencies and errors.

The proposed solution is a dual cache approach, which uses two caches to store and retrieve mentions. The first cache, called the "entity cache", stores the entities and their corresponding mentions. The second cache, called the "mention cache", stores the mentions and their corresponding entities. The dual cache approach allows for faster and more accurate retrieval of mentions and entities, which improves the overall performance of the coreference resolution task.

The dual cache is designed to handle the challenges of long documents by using a combination of techniques, including hierarchical clustering and attention mechanisms. Hierarchical clustering is used to group mentions into clusters based on their similarity, while attention mechanisms are used to focus on the most relevant mentions when retrieving entities.

The proposed approach has been evaluated on several benchmarks and has achieved state-of-the-art results. The results show that the dual cache approach significantly improves the performance of coreference resolution on long documents, with an average improvement of 5.6% in F1-score compared to traditional methods. The approach is also scalable and can handle documents of varying lengths, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.</sample>

Yunxi from Shenzhen, a city known for its technology, introduces a new work on neural divide and concrete reasoning framework for image retrieval from statistically complex text. The task of image retrieval from complex text is challenging because the images are highly similar and the descriptions are lengthy. Traditional methods such as visual language models may not be effective in this scenario. The proposed framework aims to address this issue by incorporating neural divide and concrete reasoning techniques. The neural divide approach allows for the separation of semantic and spatial features, enabling the model to better capture the relationships between images and text. The concrete reasoning framework, on the other hand, enables the model to reason about the concrete objects and their relationships in the image. By combining these two approaches, the framework can effectively retrieve images from complex text descriptions. The proposed framework has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of image retrieval tasks, especially in scenarios where the images are highly similar and the descriptions are lengthy.</sample>

Si Yu-Yuan from Fudan University introduces their work, "Distinguished Script Knowledge from Language Models for Constrained Language Planning". They note that people often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of scripts, which are common in everyday life. Previous work has used language models to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities, such as making a sandwich or having a conversation. However, these models are limited in their ability to generalize to new situations and contexts. The proposed approach aims to address this limitation by extracting distinguished script knowledge from language models and using it for constrained language planning. The authors propose a novel method to identify key phrases and sentences in a script that are crucial for planning and execution. They also introduce a new evaluation metric to assess the quality of the generated scripts. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on a dataset of everyday activities, such as planning a trip or making a phone call. The results show that their method outperforms existing approaches in terms of fluency, coherence, and relevance. The authors believe that their work has the potential to improve the ability of language models to plan and generate scripts for a wide range of applications, including customer service, education, and healthcare.</sample>

The speaker introduces a work on hierarchical question decomposition trees for explainable question answering (SQA). SQA aims to not only answer a question but also provide an explanation for the selected answer. The work can be categorized into two directions: neural symbolic methods and logical reasoning methods. Neural symbolic methods translate natural language questions into formal representations, such as Sparkle, to facilitate logical reasoning. Logical reasoning methods, on the other hand, use logical rules and inference to derive the answer. The speaker will focus on the former approach, using a hierarchical question decomposition tree to break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions, and then use neural networks to reason over the tree to generate an answer and explanation. The hierarchical decomposition tree is constructed by recursively applying a set of predefined rules to the question, generating a tree-like structure. The neural network is then used to traverse the tree, generating an answer and explanation at each node. The speaker believes that this approach can provide a more interpretable and transparent explanation for the answer, as the network's reasoning process can be visualized through the hierarchical decomposition tree.</sample>

Xiangbin, a PhD student at the University of Washington, is presenting a study on the impact of pre-training data on language models and the resulting political biases. The study focuses on the fact that language models are trained on large-scale web crawl data, which includes a significant amount of political news media content from sources such as the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Huffington Post. According to a survey of the C4 corpus, these sources are well-represented in the pre-training data.

This raises concerns about the potential for political biases in the language models, as they may reflect the biases present in the pre-training data. The study aims to track the trails of these biases and their impact on downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and text classification.

The researchers are investigating how the biases in the pre-training data affect the performance of the language models on these tasks, and whether the models are more likely to perpetuate existing biases or learn to overcome them. The study also explores the implications of these findings for the development of more fair and unbiased NLP models.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering the potential biases in pre-training data and the need for more diverse and representative data sources to develop more accurate and unbiased language models.</sample>

The speaker, Anwei Haozhen, introduces their research work on Scene-to-Unseen Exploring Complacational Generation of Mutual Triple Control Dialogue Generation. They are joined by Lulu Zhao, Keqinghe Extra, and their team from Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications. The speaker will present their work in seven aspects, starting with the motivations behind their research.

The motivation for this study is to explore the generation of dialogue in unseen scenarios, where the conversation is not limited to a specific domain or topic. The goal is to develop a system that can generate dialogue in a more flexible and adaptive manner, allowing it to respond to a wide range of questions and topics. The system should be able to understand the context and generate responses that are coherent, natural, and relevant to the conversation.

To achieve this, the researchers propose a novel approach called Mutual Triple Control Dialogue Generation, which involves three key components: scene understanding, dialogue understanding, and response generation. The scene understanding module aims to analyze the context and identify the key elements of the scene, such as the characters, setting, and plot. The dialogue understanding module analyzes the conversation and identifies the speaker's intent, tone, and emotions. The response generation module uses this information to generate a response that is coherent, natural, and relevant to the conversation.

The researchers claim that their approach can improve the quality and flexibility of dialogue generation, allowing the system to respond to a wider range of questions and topics. They also claim that their approach can be applied to various applications, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation.</sample>

Gabriella Skedelinskaya introduces a joint work with Henning Bach on detecting improvable claims for argumentative writing support. She begins by highlighting the importance of text revision in professional writing. Text revision is a recursive process that aims to achieve optimal phrasing from the author's perspective. The right words and phrases can significantly impact the effectiveness of an argument, and revising claims is crucial for strengthening an argumentative text.

The speakers then discuss the challenges of identifying claims in text, which can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. They propose a new approach that utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to automatically detect claims in text. This approach can help authors identify areas for improvement and provide suggestions for revising their claims.

The speakers also touch on the importance of considering the author's perspective in the revision process. They emphasize that a good writer should aim to convey their message in a clear and concise manner, using language that is easy to understand. The goal is to create a compelling argument that resonates with the audience.

The presentation concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of using the proposed approach. By automating the process of claim detection, authors can save time and effort, and focus on refining their arguments. The approach can also help authors identify areas where they may need to provide more evidence or clarify their claims.

Ethan introduces a paper on human-in-the-loop evaluation for early misinformation detection, specifically in the context of COVID-19 treatments. The paper is a joint work with Yang Chen, Wei Shu, and Alan Ritter at Georgia Tech. Ethan notes that existing approaches for automatically detecting misinformation on social media platforms have two key limitations. Firstly, these systems are often unrealistically evaluated, as they are typically tested on datasets that are not representative of real-world scenarios. Secondly, these systems often rely on machine learning models that are not robust to out-of-distribution inputs or adversarial attacks.

Ethan and his team propose a human-in-the-loop evaluation approach to address these limitations. They design a system that combines machine learning models with human evaluators to detect misinformation on social media platforms. The system uses a hybrid approach, where machine learning models are used to identify potential misinformation, and then human evaluators are brought in to verify the accuracy of the detected misinformation.

The paper presents a case study of COVID-19 treatments, where the system is trained on a dataset of social media posts and then evaluated on a separate test set. The results show that the human-in-the-loop approach outperforms traditional machine learning-based approaches in detecting misinformation, particularly in cases where the misinformation is subtle or context-dependent. The paper concludes that human-in-the-loop evaluation is a promising approach for detecting misinformation on social media platforms, and that it can be used to improve the accuracy and robustness of misinformation detection systems.</sample>

Lening Jiang introduces a study on analyzing high-agreement workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for summarization tasks. The study aims to develop a two-step pipeline to identify high-agreement workers on AMT. The motivation behind this pipeline is that automatic matrix annotation can be problematic and may not always accurately reflect human judgment. The two-step pipeline consists of a training phase and a testing phase. In the training phase, workers are presented with a set of sentences and asked to rate the relevance of each sentence to a given topic. The workers with high agreement scores are then selected for the testing phase. In the testing phase, the selected workers are asked to summarize a set of text passages. The summaries are then evaluated using a combination of automated and human evaluation metrics. The results show that the proposed pipeline is effective in identifying high-agreement workers who can provide high-quality summaries. The study contributes to the development of a more accurate and efficient method for identifying high-agreement workers on AMT, which can improve the quality of human-annotated datasets and the performance of natural language processing models.</sample>

Mario Hedra Aragon introduces a research project called Disorder, a double domain adaptation model for detecting signs of mental disorders on social media. The project is a collaborative effort between researchers from Mexico and Spain. He begins by defining mental disorders as psychological syndromes characterized by distress and disability that affect thinking, feeling, mood, and behavior. There are various types of mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and personality disorders.

The Disorder model aims to detect signs of mental disorders on social media by analyzing user-generated content. The model uses a double domain approach, combining both linguistic and behavioral features to identify potential indicators of mental health issues. The linguistic features include language patterns, sentiment analysis, and semantic analysis, while the behavioral features involve analyzing user behavior, such as posting frequency, engagement, and interaction patterns.

The researchers believe that social media can be a valuable source of data for mental health research, as it provides a unique window into people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. By analyzing social media data, the Disorder model can help identify early warning signs of mental health issues, enabling early intervention and prevention. The project's ultimate goal is to develop a tool that can accurately detect mental disorders and provide personalized support to individuals in need.</sample>

The speaker is presenting their work on mitigating label biases for in-context learning. In-context learning is a popular paradigm for utilizing large language models, but it is known to be unstable due to various design choices, such as the choice and order of in-context examples. Prior work has shown that this instability arises from the various biases present in the training data. The speaker aims to address this issue by developing a new method to mitigate these biases.

The speaker notes that in-context learning is a popular approach because it allows language models to learn from a small number of examples in the context of a specific task. However, this approach is limited by the biases present in the training data, which can lead to inaccurate and biased predictions. The speaker's goal is to develop a method that can identify and mitigate these biases, allowing the language model to learn more accurately and fairly.

The speaker's approach involves using a combination of techniques to identify and mitigate biases in the training data. These techniques include data augmentation, which involves generating new examples by modifying the existing data, and data filtering, which involves removing or weighting examples that are deemed biased. The speaker also uses a technique called "counterfactual data augmentation," which involves generating new examples that are the opposite of the original examples.

The speaker's method is evaluated on a variety of tasks, including text classification and sentiment analysis.

Lin Wo, a graduate student at Zhizhan University, China, is presenting a paper on "TABT toward transferable audiovisual tech generation task generation". Currently, unimodal tasks such as machine translation and image captioning have received significant attention and large-scale production due to their model capacity. However, multimodal tasks, which involve generating audio and visual content simultaneously, have been less explored. The speaker aims to address this gap by proposing a novel approach to generate transferable audiovisual tech tasks. The approach involves using a unified framework to generate audio and visual content, which can be applied to various scenarios such as video summarization, video captioning, and audio description.

The proposed framework consists of three main components: audio and visual feature extraction, multimodal fusion, and generation. The audio feature extraction module extracts acoustic features from the audio signal, while the visual feature extraction module extracts visual features from the video. The multimodal fusion module combines the extracted features to generate a unified representation of the input data. The generation module then generates the output audio and visual content based on the fused representation.

The proposed approach has several advantages, including the ability to generate high-quality audio and visual content, flexibility in handling different input formats, and potential applications in various domains. The speaker concludes by highlighting the potential of the proposed approach in advancing the field of multimodal tech generation and its potential applications in real-world scenarios.</sample>

IndicMT Eval is a dataset for meta-evaluating machine translation metrics for Indian languages. The dataset aims to evaluate the performance of different machine translation metrics for the translation task from English to Indian languages. The evaluation metrics proposed for this task include BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, among others. These metrics are widely used to evaluate the quality of machine translations and are often used as a proxy for human evaluation.

However, there are several limitations and shortcomings associated with each of these metrics. For instance, BLEU is sensitive to the order of the words in the translation, which can lead to incorrect evaluations. METEOR, on the other hand, is more robust to word order changes but may not capture the nuances of human evaluation. ROUGE, a recall-oriented metric, is more sensitive to the presence of key phrases and n-grams in the translation.

To address these limitations, researchers have proposed various methods for meta-evaluating these metrics. One approach is to analyze the correlation between machine translation metrics and human scores, which can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each metric. Another approach is to discuss the advantages and shortcomings of each metric and identify the best metric for a particular task or domain.

The IndicMT Eval dataset aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for machine translation metrics in Indian languages. By meta-evaluating these metrics, researchers can gain a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and develop more effective evaluation strategies for machine translation systems. The dataset can also facilitate the development of new metrics that better capture the nuances of human evaluation and improve the overall quality of machine translations.</sample>

Kaio Yin introduces a research paper titled "When does translation require context? A data-driven multilingual exploration" in collaboration with Patrick Frenange, MEU, Andre F.D. Martin, and Graham Mubig. The paper explores how context affects translations. Kaio uses an example sentence "more in this sentence" and explains that the meaning of "more" changes depending on the previous sentence. If the previous sentence is "things could start to get dangerous if the ministers find out", then "more" refers to a specific slide. This illustrates how context is crucial in translation, as the same word can have different meanings in different situations.</sample>

Xue Kai-Ju introduces a new work in SL 2023, focusing on non-parallel story style transfer. This task involves generating a new story in a different style from a given story, which is a challenging problem in natural language generation. Most previous studies have focused on token-level or sentence-level style transfer, such as sentiment transfer, but this new work aims to address the story-level style transfer task.

The proposed method uses a course representation to enhance the story style transfer. The course representation is a novel approach that captures the underlying structure and semantics of the story, allowing for more effective style transfer. The model is trained on a large dataset of stories with different styles, and the results show that the proposed method can generate stories in a new style that is close to the original story.

The work also explores the use of a transformer-based model to enhance the style transfer performance. The transformer model is a powerful language model that has been shown to be effective in various NLP tasks, and it is used here to generate the new story in the target style. The results show that the transformer-based model can improve the quality of the generated story and make it more coherent and fluent.

Overall, the proposed method is a significant contribution to the field of natural language generation, as it addresses a challenging task and achieves state-of-the-art results. The work has potential applications in various areas, such as language translation, text summarization, and content generation.</sample>

Peng Pian Shuo from Wuhan University presents a paper titled "SSUIE: A Novel Few-Shot Dispersal Mechanism for Enhancing Universal Information Extraction" at the ACL MEN conference. The current SBAN-based UI model identifies and labels the SBAN boundaries of targets in text, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. The proposed SSUIE mechanism aims to address this issue by introducing a few-shot dispersal mechanism. This approach can effectively reduce the computational cost and improve the efficiency of information extraction.

The SSUIE mechanism is based on a novel few-shot learning framework, which can learn from a small amount of labeled data and adapt to new tasks quickly. The framework consists of three main components: a few-shot learner, a dispersal module, and a fusion module. The few-shot learner is responsible for learning the target knowledge from a small set of labeled data, while the dispersal module is designed to disperse the learned knowledge to the entire input sequence. The fusion module combines the dispersed knowledge with the original input sequence to produce the final output.

The experimental results show that the proposed SSUIE mechanism significantly outperforms the baseline method in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The few-shot dispersal mechanism can effectively reduce the computational cost by 80% while maintaining the same level of accuracy. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering.</sample>

Min-Chi-Gao from Peking University presents their work, "Reference Matters", which benchmarks factory error correction for data resummelization using the FANG-Grant evaluation framework. The video highlights the key points of their work. The speaker notes that summaries generated by models and even reference summaries often contain factory errors. Two main solutions are proposed to address this issue. The first approach is to introduce a factory error correction mechanism into the model, which can correct errors by referencing the original data. The second approach is to use a reference-based method, which compares the generated summary with the reference summary to identify and correct errors. The FANG-Grant evaluation framework is used to evaluate the effectiveness of these solutions. The results show that the proposed methods can significantly improve the accuracy of the generated summaries and reduce the number of errors. The speaker concludes that their work provides a new perspective on factory error correction and has potential applications in various NLP tasks.</sample>

Valerio Basile introduces a collaborative project between the University of Turin and Amazon Alexa. He explains that natural language understanding and processing are largely based on supervised machine learning or data-driven approaches. To develop these approaches, a large amount of data is required. However, collecting and annotating such data is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. This project aims to address this challenge by using active learning to select the most informative samples from a large dataset, which can then be used to train a machine learning model. The approach involves using Amazon Alexa to collect data from users and then selecting the most informative samples based on their relevance to a specific task or topic. The selected samples are then annotated by human annotators, which reduces the workload and increases the efficiency of the annotation process. The project also uses transfer learning to adapt the machine learning model to the specific task or topic, which can improve its performance. The results show that the active learning approach can significantly reduce the amount of annotated data required to achieve a certain level of performance, making it a promising solution for large-scale natural language processing tasks.</sample>

Dawei, a PhD student at Salant University in Germany, introduces their recent work, Wiccadene Think, a critical examination of weekly supervised learning. The work is a joint effort with Xiao Yuxian, Mario Smusba, Diaz Stefan, and Diti Shklako. Dawei begins by providing a brief introduction to week supervision and weekly supervised learning. In week supervision, the focus is on managing and optimizing the learning process by adjusting the learning rate and other hyperparameters on a weekly basis. This approach aims to improve the overall performance and stability of the model.

Dawei then discusses the limitations of traditional supervised learning methods, which often rely on a fixed learning rate and do not adapt well to changing environments. He highlights the importance of incorporating domain knowledge and prior information to improve the performance of the model. The Wiccadene Think framework addresses this limitation by introducing a novel approach that combines domain knowledge and prior information with weekly supervision.

The framework consists of three main components: a domain knowledge module, a prior information module, and a weekly supervision module. The domain knowledge module incorporates expert knowledge and prior information into the learning process, while the prior information module provides a probabilistic representation of the prior knowledge. The weekly supervision module adjusts the learning rate and other hyperparameters based on the performance of the model.

Dawei presents experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Wiccadene Think framework in improving the performance of the model. The results show that the framework outperforms traditional supervised learning methods in terms of accuracy and stability. Dawei concludes by highlighting the potential applications of the Wiccadene Think framework in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender systems.</sample>

Jenny, a first-year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, presents her work on analyzing a dataset of models to characterize design positions. She collaborated with researchers from the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI, including Sebastian Santy, Ronin LaBros, Katarina Aranica, and Martin Sapp. 

She begins by imagining herself working for a newspaper, sifting through comments under an article to remove unwanted posts. She notes that this task is challenging because it requires identifying and removing spam, hate speech, and off-topic comments while preserving valuable feedback from readers. 

Jenny's work aims to address this challenge by developing a model that can automatically classify comments as relevant or irrelevant. She uses a dataset of labeled comments to train the model, which is then evaluated on its ability to accurately identify relevant comments. 

The model is based on a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, including word embeddings, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of comments from various online platforms, including social media and online forums.

Pung Li from FDN University presents their work on Code IE, a last code generation model for field short information extractors. Information extraction is a classic task in natural language processing, involving extracting structured information from unstructured text. Common information extraction tasks include named entity recognition, entity recognition, and relation extraction (RE). The goal is to identify and extract specific information from text, such as names, dates, and relationships between entities.

The team's Code IE model uses a last code generation approach to tackle this task. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled text and uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. The model is designed to identify and extract specific information from text, such as names, dates, and relationships between entities.

The Code IE model has been evaluated on several benchmarks and has achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. The model's performance is competitive with other state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in extracting structured information from unstructured text. The team plans to further improve the model by incorporating additional techniques, such as attention mechanisms and multi-task learning, to enhance its performance and adaptability to different tasks and domains.</sample>

Enrico introduces himself and presents his topic at ACL23, exploring what a text classifier learns about morality. He defines morality as the internal compass that helps humans distinguish right from wrong, determining whether an action or concept is morally right or wrong. Morality is the foundation of human behavior, influencing how we make decisions and interact with others.

Enrico explains that text classification models, specifically, are trained on large datasets of text and can learn to identify moral concepts and categorize them as right or wrong. These models can analyze linguistic features such as word choice, syntax, and semantics to infer moral judgments. By doing so, they can recognize moral language, such as phrases like "good" or "bad", and classify texts accordingly.

However, Enrico notes that text classifiers may not necessarily learn moral principles or values, but rather moral concepts and categories. He suggests that this raises questions about the nature of morality and whether machines can truly understand moral principles. Can machines learn to distinguish between moral relativism and moral absolutism? Can they grasp the complexities of moral dilemmas and nuances of moral reasoning?

Enrico's research aims to investigate how text classifiers learn about morality, exploring the extent to which they can recognize and categorize moral concepts, and whether they can be used to analyze and understand moral language. The implications of this research could be significant, potentially shedding light on the capabilities and limitations of AI in understanding human morality and decision-making.</sample>

Yuji Wang from Shanxi University in China introduces his paper on "Dynamic Hattery Grants Graph, running with language models and knowledge representation, for Common Sense QA". Common Sense QA is a challenging task that evaluates a model's ability to answer questions that rely on general knowledge. The goal is to develop methods that can accurately answer questions that require understanding of common sense and real-world knowledge. 

The paper proposes a novel approach, called Dynamic Hattery Grants Graph (DHGG), which combines language models and knowledge representation to tackle this challenge. The DHGG model consists of three components: a language model, a knowledge graph, and a dynamic graph generator. The language model is trained on a large corpus of text data to learn the language patterns and syntax. The knowledge graph is built by extracting relevant entities and relationships from a large knowledge base. The dynamic graph generator uses the language model and knowledge graph to generate a graph that represents the relationships between entities and concepts. 

The DHGG model is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including the Common Sense QA dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results. The results show that the DHGG model outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and F1-score. The proposed approach can effectively leverage the strengths of language models and knowledge representation to answer common sense questions, and has the potential to be applied to various natural language processing tasks.</sample>

Zhen Mi-hang from Peking University presents their work on "Generating Structured Studentlabers for Lowest-Received and Zero-Shot Video-Sense Localization". This research was conducted in collaboration with Shaogang, Ailing, Yu Xin, and Yang. The team focused on zero-shot video-sense localization, which aims to identify the most relevant segments in unknown videos without providing any natural language queries. This task has gained attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various fields, such as video retrieval, summarization, and content analysis.

The researchers developed a novel approach called "Generating Structured Studentlabers" to tackle this problem. Studentlabers are a type of intermediate representation that captures the semantic meaning of a video segment. The team proposed a two-stage framework, which first generates studentlabers for each segment and then uses these representations to identify the most relevant segments.

The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the lowest-received video-sense localization task, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying relevant segments in unknown videos without requiring any additional information. The team's work has the potential to revolutionize video analysis and retrieval, enabling applications such as automatic video summarization, content-based video retrieval, and video-based recommendation systems.</sample>

Wenhao from Nan University introduces their work on nearest neighbor machine translation. They acknowledge collaborators Jingjing Xu from Shanghai AILAP, Shu Jianhuang and Jia Juncheng from Nan University, and Lin Pongkong from the University of Hong Kong. The team focuses on neural machine translation, aiming to improve the target of AMD (Average Meteor Deviation). They explore the use of current knowledge in nearest neighbor machine translation, leveraging the strengths of both techniques to enhance translation quality. The researchers identify the key challenges in current machine translation systems, including the lack of contextual understanding and the difficulty in handling out-of-vocabulary words. To address these issues, they propose a novel approach that incorporates nearest neighbor information into the neural machine translation framework. The approach involves training a neural network to learn the relationships between source and target languages, as well as the context in which the words are used. By incorporating nearest neighbor information, the system can better capture the nuances of language and improve the accuracy of the translation. The team presents their methodology and experimental results, showing significant improvements in translation quality and relevance. The work demonstrates the potential of combining nearest neighbor and neural machine translation techniques to achieve better language translation outcomes.</sample>

They will provide an overview of their work and highlight its key contributions. The Outdoor Vocabulary Awards (AWE Awards) are crucial for the performance of embedding-based models, but they are difficult to represent. The researchers aim to address this challenge by developing a new approach that can efficiently mine relations between entities in a graph structure.

The proposed method, Graph-Faster Relation Mining, uses a novel graph-based framework to learn the relations between entities. This framework allows for the efficient extraction of relevant information from the graph, which is essential for the AWE Awards. The method is designed to be contest-free, meaning it does not rely on manual annotation or labeling, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

The key contributions of the research include the development of a graph-based framework for relation mining, a novel approach to efficiently extract relevant information from the graph, and the ability to learn the AWE Awards without manual annotation. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

The speaker, Matthias Lendemann, introduces a research paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations. Compositional generalization refers to a model's ability to handle deep recursion and unseen compositions. Traditional approaches rely on tree-based structures, which can be limited. The proposed method uses multi-set tagging, a technique that represents compositional structures as sets of symbols, rather than trees. This allows for more flexible and generalizable representations. Additionally, latent permutations are used to model the relationships between symbols, enabling the model to capture complex patterns and structures. The approach is demonstrated through experiments on a variety of tasks, including natural language processing and cognitive science. The results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional tree-based models and achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. The paper concludes that the multi-set tagging and latent permutation approach provides a promising direction for compositional generalization without relying on tree structures.</sample>

Xu Heng introduces his paper, "Do Kono 2003 Named Entity Taggers Still Work in 2023", and begins by discussing the problem of generalization in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. He notes that many models still rely on Kono 2003, a dataset from 2003, to develop NER systems, despite the significant advancements in NLP technology since then. The speaker's team investigated whether these models still work effectively in 2023.</sample>

The speaker introduces a research paper on Python code generation by asking clarification questions. The topic of code generation and program synthesis from natural language descriptions is a challenging research area. Current state-of-the-art methods fail to address the problem of input underspecification, which is a major challenge. The authors propose a new approach to address this issue by using clarification questions to gather more information from the user. The approach is based on a deep learning model that generates Python code snippets from natural language descriptions. The model is trained on a dataset of code snippets and corresponding natural language descriptions. The authors evaluate their approach on a dataset of 1,000 code snippets and achieve a high accuracy of 85%. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively address the problem of input underspecification and generate accurate Python code snippets from natural language descriptions.</sample>

hello, my name is Vasudha, I am a computer science PhD candidate at Stony Brook University, I'd like to present our work accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper, Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection, addressing the rare class challenge. We start by defining cognitive dissonance and why it's an important problem to study in language. Simply put, cognitive dissonance is two beliefs or actions that are inconsistent with each other, which can cause psychological discomfort or stress.

    <sample id="361">Arminine Nourbach, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and research director at JP Morgan AI, presents her research on "Counter Comp", which aims to improve compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning using counterfactual scenarios. The research focuses on the question answering task, where a financial table is provided as an example. The goal is to enable the system to answer complex questions by using counterfactual scenarios, which are hypothetical situations that did not actually occur. This can help the system to better understand the relationships between different variables and make more accurate predictions. The research has potential applications in finance, such as predicting stock prices and analyzing financial data.</sample>
