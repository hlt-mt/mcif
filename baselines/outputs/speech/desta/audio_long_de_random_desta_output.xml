The paper, presented by Tui from Ad Group, focuses on visually rich document understanding. The authors, all algorithm engineers from Ad Group, draw from their practical experience in this field. The goal is to understand visually rich documents, which are often complex and contain various types of information, such as images, tables, and text. The paper introduces a novel approach to document understanding, which involves a hierarchical representation of the document structure and a modularized processing pipeline. This allows for efficient and accurate extraction of relevant information from the document. The approach is evaluated on a dataset of visually rich documents and achieves state-of-the-art results. The paper also discusses the challenges and limitations of the approach and potential future directions for improvement. The authors conclude that their method can be applied to a wide range of applications, such as document summarization, information retrieval, and question answering.</sample>

The speaker, Zhang, presents a joint research work with five collaborators to unify multilingual and cross-lingual summarization into a more general setting, called many-to-many summarization. They aim to summarize texts in multiple languages and translate them into another language. The approach is designed to address the limitations of existing multilingual summarization models, which typically focus on summarizing texts in a single language or translating a single text into multiple languages. The proposed many-to-many summarization framework allows for summarizing texts in multiple languages and translating them into a target language. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using several benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. The model is evaluated on various languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, and Chinese, and shows improved performance compared to existing methods. The work has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of multilingual summarization and translation tasks, and can be applied in various real-world applications, such as news summarization, machine translation, and language learning.</sample>

    <sample id="11">Jack Hessell, a research scientist at AI2, presents a study on humor understanding in the context of the New Yorker caption contest. The study, a collaboration with researchers from the University of Utah, Cornell University, University of Washington, Airmail, and OpenAI, investigates whether large language models can generate and explain jokes. The researchers found that these models can indeed create and explain jokes, as demonstrated by the language model ChatGPT, which can be asked to tell a joke. The study's goal is to develop a benchmark for humor understanding, which they call "Do Androids Laugh at Electric Sheep". The benchmark consists of a dataset of 1,000 New Yorker cartoon captions with corresponding explanations, which are used to train and evaluate the models' ability to understand humor. The study aims to improve the understanding of humor in AI systems, enabling them to better comprehend and generate humor, and potentially even create new forms of comedy.</sample>

Hello everyone, my name is Daniel Rotem and I will be presenting my work, "Finding the Sweet Spot Analysis and Improvement of Adaptive Inference in Low Resource Settings", which was done in Professor Roy Schwartz's lab at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Adaptive inference is a method for reducing the inference time of large language models. We rely on the fact that real-world data varies in complexity. Therefore, we can use low-capacity models for simple tasks and high-capacity models for complex tasks. This approach can significantly reduce the inference time and improve the overall performance of the models. However, finding the optimal model capacity for a specific task is challenging, as it depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the task itself. In this work, we propose a novel method for finding the sweet spot of adaptive inference, which balances the trade-off between inference time and performance. Our method uses a combination of automatic relevance determination and model pruning to find the optimal model capacity for a given task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several language modeling tasks and show that it can significantly improve the inference time and performance of the models.</sample>

The framework is designed to provide explanations for a predicted decision made by a classifier. One approach to interpreting this decision is selective rationalization, which highlights important features in a faithful manner. Another approach is counter-focal text generation, which generates an alternative text that contradicts the original prediction. Crest combines these two methods to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the decision-making process. The framework is demonstrated using an input example, where the classifier predicts a particular decision, and Crest provides an explanation by highlighting relevant features and generating a counter-focal text. The goal of Crest is to enable more transparent and accountable AI decision-making by providing users with a deeper understanding of the reasoning behind the predictions.</sample>

Title: Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection: Addressing the Rare Class Challenge

We present our work on Transfer Learning for Dissonance Detection, accepted into ACL 2023 as a long paper. Cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort caused by holding two conflicting beliefs or actions. This phenomenon is crucial to study in language, as it can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and miscommunication. We tackle the rare class challenge of detecting dissonance in text, where the majority of text does not exhibit dissonance. We propose a transfer learning approach, leveraging pre-trained language models to adapt to the dissonance detection task. Our approach demonstrates improved performance and robustness, achieving a significant improvement over baseline models. Our work has implications for natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and dialogue systems, where dissonance detection can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of these systems.</sample>

    <sample id="62">Ntai Kaldaron, the main author of an ACL paper, presents a systematic study on Nord distillation for natural language generation. This collaboration with Amir and Subha from Microsoft and his PhD advisor Roy aims to address the issue of large language models becoming increasingly complex, slow, and costly. These models are the foundation of natural language generation systems, but their growth in size and complexity leads to significant computational and financial burdens. The study focuses on Nord distillation, a technique that can improve the efficiency and performance of these models. The authors explore the benefits of using pseudo-target training, which involves training a smaller model to mimic the behavior of a larger, pre-trained model. This approach can significantly reduce the computational resources required to train and deploy large language models, making them more feasible for practical applications. The study's findings demonstrate the potential of Nord distillation and pseudo-target training to improve the efficiency and scalability of natural language generation systems, paving the way for more widespread adoption in industries and applications.</sample>

Uri discusses the concept of interference in multilingual translation models, where synergy between different language pairs can either improve or hinder the quality of translation. For instance, training a model to translate English to Finnish may enhance the performance on English to Estonian, while English to Chinese might have a negative impact. To mitigate interference, various methods have been proposed, but most are demonstrated using small models and may not generalize well to larger models. Uri suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of interference is needed to develop effective solutions. He also notes that the problem of interference is particularly challenging in low-resource languages, where there is limited data and limited computational resources.</sample>

    <sample id="84">Shih-He presents his paper "Pardonate: An Efficient Framework for Dynamic Networks" at the ACL 2023 conference. He begins by discussing the limitations of traditional static networks, which only accept fixed input values. He argues that real-world networks are often dynamic, with changing node relationships and evolving patterns. This necessitates the development of dynamic networks that can adapt to these changes. Shih-He's framework, Pardonate, aims to address this challenge by introducing a novel architecture that efficiently processes dynamic networks. The framework is designed to handle various types of node relationships, including edges, nodes, and their attributes. Pardonate uses a combination of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to learn representations of the dynamic network, enabling it to adapt to changes in the network structure and node relationships. The framework is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing methods in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Overall, Pardonate presents a promising approach to handling dynamic networks, with potential applications in areas such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and traffic prediction.</sample>

The paper highlights the growing concern of backdoor wordmark, which is a technique used to embed a hidden message or code into a model's output. This technique can be used to manipulate the model's behavior and compromise its integrity. The authors of the paper argue that this is a significant threat to the security and reliability of language models, which are increasingly being used in various applications such as chatbots, language translation, and text summarization. They propose several measures to prevent backdoor wordmark attacks, including using secure embedding techniques and monitoring model behavior.

The speaker, Shetanya, introduces a paper called Quest, a collaborative work with Pete, Mingwei, Kenton, and Christina from Google DeepMind. The motivation for this work is illustrated through two examples. Firstly, a zoologist named Jane is on a field trip in Costa Rica and encounters an unknown species of reptile. Secondly, the speaker describes a scenario where a person is trying to identify a species of tree in a forest. The speaker argues that these scenarios highlight the challenges of identifying unknown entities, whether they are species or objects. The Quest paper proposes a new approach to tackle this problem by combining multimodal embeddings, which integrate visual, textual, and auditory information, with a hierarchical neural network architecture. The goal is to enable machines to recognize and identify unknown entities more accurately.</sample>

    <sample id="108">The paper "Language Model Acceptability Judgments are not always robust to context" by Kostav Sinha et al. challenges the common practice of evaluating language models using the minimal pair paradigm. The authors argue that this approach is not robust to context and can lead to inaccurate results. The minimal pair paradigm involves presenting language models with a pair of sentences, one of which is acceptable and the other not, and evaluating the model's ability to identify the unacceptable sentence. However, the authors demonstrate that this approach can be influenced by various factors such as the linguistic context, the presence of ambiguity, and the model's prior knowledge. They propose an alternative approach, which involves evaluating language models on their ability to predict human acceptability judgments in a more nuanced and context-dependent manner. The authors also provide experimental results that support their claims and demonstrate the limitations of the minimal pair paradigm. Overall, the paper highlights the need for more robust and context-aware evaluation methods for language models.</sample>

The speaker, Or, introduces a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can generalize to unseen tasks without human intervention. This is achieved through instruction tuning, which allows language models to learn from instructions rather than solely relying on large amounts of data. One way to obtain examples for instruction tuning is to reformulate existing datasets, such as those used in language understanding and processing (LAP) tasks. However, this approach is limited to existing academic benchmarks, whereas instructions can be used to describe any textual task. The speaker suggests that this approach has the potential to expand the scope of NLP tasks that can be tackled without human intervention. The model can be trained on a wide range of tasks, from simple language translation to complex tasks such as text summarization and question answering. The goal is to enable language models to learn from natural language instructions, allowing them to generalize to new tasks and domains without requiring extensive human annotation or fine-tuning.</sample>

Hello, I'm James Finch. And I'm Sarah Finch. And today we'll tell you all about ABC eval, a new dimensional approach to evaluating conversational AI. This work was done by the Emory NLP Lab, led by Professor Geno Choi at Emory University, and in collaboration with Amazon Alexa AI. So let's say that you just developed a dialogue model and you want to see how well it compares against the current state of the art. The common practice is to use human evaluation. However, human evaluation is time-consuming, expensive, and subjective. Moreover, it's hard to scale and it doesn't provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. ABC eval addresses these limitations by providing a new framework for evaluating conversational AI. It's based on three dimensions: fluency, coherence, and engagement. Fluency measures the model's ability to generate grammatically correct and natural-sounding language. Coherence assesses the model's ability to generate responses that are relevant and logical. Engagement evaluates the model's ability to hold the user's attention and keep them interested.</sample>

Sissong from the Singapore University of Technology and Design presents their research project "Tell-To Design", which focuses on generating floor plans from natural language descriptions. The project was published in ACL2023. Recent advancements in conditional generative AI models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality images from sentence-level descriptions. These models excel in understanding high-level visual concepts and producing realistic and creative images. However, most of these models are limited to image generation and lack the ability to generate 2D or 3D floor plans. The Tell-To Design project aims to bridge this gap by developing a data cell that can generate floor plans from language-based descriptions. The system uses a novel architecture that combines a language model with a generative design model to produce floor plans that are both realistic and functional. The system is designed to be flexible and can be applied to various scenarios, including urban planning, interior design, and architecture. The project has the potential to revolutionize the way we design and plan spaces, making it easier and more efficient to create functional and aesthetically pleasing spaces.</sample>

Zhou Yicheng, a PhD student from Fudan University, introduces his paper on analyzing omissions in dialogue summarization. He briefly explains the background of dialogue summarization, which is a subtask of text summarization that condenses a dialogue into a concise summary of its most important information. There are various scenarios in dialogue summarization, such as summarizing meetings, conversations, or interviews. The speaker will present his research on identifying omissions in dialogue summarization, which is a challenging task due to the complexity of human communication. Omissions can occur when important information is missing or not explicitly stated, making it difficult to create an accurate summary. The speaker aims to develop a method to detect and fill these omissions, enabling more accurate dialogue summarization. He will discuss the approach, results, and potential applications of his research in the field of natural language processing and human-computer interaction.</sample>

Meetings generate vast amounts of transcripts, which can be a new domain for NLP research. The meeting domain is unique and interesting due to its structured and informal nature, as well as the presence of multiple speakers, topics, and domains. The paper focuses on extractive question answering, which involves identifying relevant parts of the transcript to answer questions. The authors propose a multi-task learning approach that combines question classification, answer selection, and answer extraction. They use a dataset of meeting transcripts and evaluate their approach on this dataset. The results show that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The paper contributes to the development of more effective question answering systems for meeting transcripts and has potential applications in areas such as summarization, information retrieval, and virtual assistants.</sample>

    <sample id="158">Xiang Guanhu from AWS introduces the topic of dual cache for long document neural coreference resolution. He starts by explaining the task of coreference resolution, which involves identifying and clustering mentions of entities across a text that refer to the same entity. This is a challenging task, especially for long documents. The traditional approach uses a single cache to store the context and entity information, which can lead to limited scalability and accuracy. To address this issue, Xiang proposes the use of a dual cache system, which consists of two caches: a sentence-level cache and a document-level cache. The sentence-level cache stores information about the context of each sentence, while the document-level cache stores information about the entire document. This dual cache approach allows for more accurate and efficient coreference resolution, especially for long documents. Xiang also discusses the architecture and implementation of the dual cache system, including the use of neural networks and attention mechanisms. The proposed system shows promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making it a potential solution for large-scale coreference resolution tasks.</sample>

We present a novel work on neural divide and concrete reasoning framework for image retrieval from statistically complex text. This task is challenging due to highly similar images and long descriptions. Traditional methods, such as visual language models, struggle to effectively retrieve images from complex text descriptions. Our approach addresses this issue by introducing a neural divide and concrete reasoning framework, which leverages the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning. The framework consists of two main components: a neural network-based image encoder and a concrete reasoning module. The image encoder extracts visual features from images, while the concrete reasoning module generates a set of concrete features from text descriptions. The two components are then combined to retrieve images from complex text descriptions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.</sample>

This talk, given by Melanie Sklar, explores the concept of "Minding Language" in the context of Theory of Mind, a cognitive ability to reason about others' mental states. The speaker discusses the application of this concept to language models, particularly in reading comprehension tasks involving multiple characters. False belief questions are introduced as a means to assess the understanding of these models. These questions present situations where reality does not align with the beliefs of certain story characters, allowing for the evaluation of the model's ability to accurately infer the mental states of others. The talk aims to demonstrate how this concept can be applied to language models in a "plug-and-play" manner, enabling the creation of more advanced and human-like language understanding capabilities.</sample>

Our research, Distinguished Script Knowledge from Language Models for Constrained Language Planning, focuses on planning actions by following step-by-step instructions, similar to how people plan their daily activities. Previous work has utilized language models to plan for abstract goals in stereotypical activities, such as cooking or traveling. However, these approaches often rely on a limited set of pre-defined scripts and may not generalize well to novel situations. Our approach, on the other hand, leverages language models to learn from a large corpus of text data and generate scripts for constrained language planning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a range of tasks, including generating scripts for everyday activities like making a reservation or sending an email. Our results show that our approach can produce high-quality scripts that are tailored to specific contexts and constraints, outperforming traditional approaches in terms of fluency, coherence, and relevance.</sample>

    <sample id="185">Based on the provided audio, I analyzed the content and found that it is not in English, but in French. Therefore, I will provide an answer in English, focusing on the difference between DrBERT and ChiuBERT, which are both language models.

DrBERT (Distilled BERT) is a smaller version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained language model developed by Google. DrBERT is a distilled version of BERT, which means it is a smaller and more efficient model that has been trained to mimic the performance of the original BERT model.

ChuBERT (Contextualized BERT) is a variant of BERT that is specifically designed for Chinese text. It is trained on a large corpus of Chinese text and is optimized for Chinese language understanding. ChuBERT is similar to DrBERT in that it is a pre-trained language model, but it is specifically tailored for the Chinese language.

In summary, the main difference between DrBERT and ChiuBERT is that DrBERT is a general-purpose language model for English, while ChiuBERT is a language model specifically designed for Chinese.</sample>

SQA aims to answer a given question and provide an explanation for the selected answer. The work can be categorized into two directions: neural-symbolic methods and neural-symbolic methods. Neural-symbolic methods translate natural language questions into formal representations, such as SPARQL, to reason over knowledge graphs. The decomposition tree is a hierarchical structure that breaks down the question into sub-questions, allowing for a more detailed and accurate answer. The approach can be applied to various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. The authors propose a novel framework that integrates neural networks and symbolic reasoning to address the limitations of traditional SQA approaches. The framework is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. The authors conclude that the hierarchical question decomposition tree is a promising approach for SQA, enabling more accurate and transparent answers.</sample>

The C4 corpus, a dataset of web pages, reveals that popular news sources such as the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Huffington Post are well-represented in the pre-training data. This raises concerns about the potential for biased language models to perpetuate unfair outcomes in downstream applications, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and language translation.

He mentions that different theories and corpus approaches assume different dependency structures for coordinated phrases. For instance, in universal dependencies, the first conjunct is considered the head of the coordinate structure, as in the example "Lisa, Bart and Maggie", where "Lisa" is the head. Igor Milnik's meaning text approach also assumes a similar structure. In contrast, other approaches, such as the Prague Dependency Treebank, consider the coordinator (e.g. "and") as the head. Szpirkowski also touches on the idea that the dependency structure of coordination can be influenced by the type of coordination, such as additive, adversative, or causal coordination. He notes that the choice of dependency structure can affect the interpretation of the coordinated phrase, and that a better understanding of the dependency structure is necessary for natural language processing and machine translation. Overall, Szpirkowski's talk highlights the importance of considering the dependency structure of coordination in linguistic theories and applications.</sample>

The first step involves filtering out workers who consistently provide low-quality summaries, and the second step involves selecting workers who have a high agreement rate with other high-quality workers. The pipeline is demonstrated through a picture, showing the two steps.</sample>

Gio Kim from KAIST AI presents a paper on Fact-Vertification via reasoning on Dolly's Crafts. The authors propose a novel approach to fact-checking and verifying the credibility of online content, particularly in the context of social media and online forums. The method, dubbed "Fact-Vertification," leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze user-generated content and identify potential misinformation.

The system uses a multi-step process to verify the accuracy of online claims. First, it extracts relevant information from the text using named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. Next, it applies logical reasoning and semantic analysis to identify potential inconsistencies and contradictions. Finally, it uses a knowledge graph to validate the information against a trusted dataset.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Fact-Vertification on a dataset of user-generated content, achieving an accuracy of 92%. They also compare their approach with existing fact-checking methods and demonstrate its superiority in detecting misinformation. The system's ability to identify and flag potentially false information can help mitigate the spread of disinformation and promote a more informed online discourse.</sample>

    <sample id="254">Sun Qi from Nanjing University of Science and Technology presents research on certainty-guided level denoising for document-level distance relation extraction. The goal is to extract relations among entities in a document. Previous methods rely on large-scale human-annotated corpora, which is time-consuming and costly. The proposed approach uses a certainty-guided level denoising method to improve the accuracy of document-level relation extraction. The method consists of two main steps: sentence-level denoising and entity-level denoising. Sentence-level denoising uses a neural network to identify and remove noisy sentences that do not contain relevant information. Entity-level denoising uses a graph-based method to identify and remove noisy entities that are not related to the target entities. The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and F1-score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the certainty-guided level denoising approach in improving the accuracy of document-level relation extraction.</sample>

Zhang Sunhan introduces a new work that explores the potential of large language models as an alternative to human evaluations in natural language processing. The research proposes using these models to assess the quality of text, by providing them with instructions and having them evaluate samples accordingly. The models are trained on a large dataset and can analyze the text based on various criteria, such as coherence, fluency, and relevance. The authors claim that this approach can be more efficient and cost-effective than human evaluation, which is time-consuming and subjective. The large language models can also provide more consistent and objective results, reducing the need for human judgment and bias. The work demonstrates the potential of large language models in automating the evaluation process, which can have significant implications for various NLP applications, such as language translation, text summarization, and question-answering systems. The authors conclude that their approach can be a valuable addition to the NLP toolkit, offering a new way to evaluate the quality of text and improve the performance of language models.</sample>

The speaker is presenting work on mitigating label biases in in-context learning, a popular approach for utilizing large language models. However, in-context learning is known to be unstable due to various design choices, such as the selection and order of examples. Previous research has shown that this instability arises from the interaction between the model and the examples. The speaker's work aims to address this issue by developing methods to mitigate label biases in in-context learning. The approach involves using a combination of techniques, including data augmentation, regularization, and attention mechanisms, to reduce the impact of biases in the training data. The results show that the proposed methods can significantly improve the stability and accuracy of in-context learning, allowing the model to learn more robust and generalizable representations of language. The speaker concludes that the proposed methods can help to overcome the limitations of in-context learning and enable more effective use of large language models in a variety of applications.</sample>
    <sample id="264">Lin Wo, a graduate student at Zhizhan University in China, presents his paper on "TABT: Transferable Audiovisual Tech Generation for Transferable Audiovisual Task Generation". He notes that unimodal tech generation tasks, such as machine translation and image captioning, have received significant attention due to their large-scale production and high model capacity. In contrast, multimodal tech generation tasks have been less explored. The speaker aims to address this gap by proposing a novel approach called TABT, which enables the transfer of knowledge between different audiovisual tasks. The approach is based on a shared latent space, where audio and visual features are embedded and aligned. This allows for the generation of transferable audiovisual content that can be adapted to various tasks, such as image-to-video generation, video-to-audio generation, and audio-to-image generation. The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality audiovisual content. The speaker concludes that TABT has the potential to revolutionize the field of multimodal tech generation and open up new possibilities for applications in areas such as entertainment, education, and communication.</sample>

Title: Story Trans: Non-Parallel Story Style Transfer with Course Representation

We present Story Trans, a novel approach to non-parallel story style transfer, addressing an important task in natural language generation. Unlike previous studies focusing on token-level or sentence-level sentimental transfer, our method enhances the representation of the entire story. We introduce a course representation that captures the overall narrative structure, enabling the transfer of style from a source story to a target story while maintaining its original meaning and coherence. Our approach consists of three components: a style encoder, a course encoder, and a decoder. The style encoder extracts relevant features from the source story, while the course encoder captures the narrative structure. The decoder generates the target story by combining the style features and course representation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in transferring styles across stories while preserving their meaning and coherence.</sample>

Peng Pian Shuo from Wuhan University is presenting a paper at the ACL MEN conference on a novel few-shot learning mechanism for enhancing universal information extraction, titled "SSUIE". The current SBAN-based UI model identifies and labels the SBAN boundaries of targets in text, which has limitations due to over-utilization of boundary positions. The proposed SSUIE mechanism aims to address this issue by introducing a few-shot learning approach that leverages a small amount of labeled data to adapt to new domains and tasks. The approach involves a novel few-shot learning framework that combines the advantages of both supervised and unsupervised learning. The framework consists of a pre-trained language model, a task-specific adapter, and a few-shot learning module. The pre-trained language model provides a general understanding of language, while the task-specific adapter adapts the model to the target task. The few-shot learning module enables the model to learn from a small amount of labeled data and adapt to new domains and tasks. The proposed SSUIE mechanism is expected to improve the performance of universal information extraction tasks and reduce the need for large amounts of labeled data.</sample>

He highlights that natural language understanding and processing rely heavily on supervised machine learning and data-driven approaches. To develop these approaches, large amounts of data are required. However, collecting and labeling this data is a time-consuming and expensive process, which can limit the development of new models. To address this issue, the team aimed to create a new approach that uses self-supervised learning, which can learn from unlabeled data. The proposed method, called "Self-Supervised Learning for Natural Language Processing" (SSL-NLP), uses a combination of techniques, including masked language modeling and contrastive learning, to learn meaningful representations of language without relying on labeled data. The results show that SSL-NLP outperforms traditional supervised learning methods on several natural language processing tasks, including language modeling, sentiment analysis, and question answering. The team believes that this approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing and make it more accessible to a wider range of applications.</sample>
    <sample id="297">The speaker discusses the use of coded language, specifically "dog whistles", in political rhetoric.

He is joined by co-author Andreas Vlahos from the University of Cambridge. Despite NLiModels achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks, recent studies have shown that their success is partly due to learning and exploiting shortcuts. To address this issue, Michalis and Andreas propose a minimax training framework that encourages the model to learn robust representations by maximizing the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels, while minimizing the difference between the model's predictions and the labels it predicts with high confidence. This approach aims to reduce the model's reliance on shortcuts and improve its ability to generalize to unseen data. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several benchmarks, showing that it can improve the robustness of NLiModels and enhance their ability to generalize to new situations.</sample>

He defines morality as the internal compass that helps humans distinguish right from wrong, determining whether an action or concept is morally right or wrong. He argues that morality is fundamental to human decision-making and behavior. Enrico's research focuses on text classification, where he trains a model to classify texts as morally good, bad, or neutral. He uses a dataset of texts from various sources, including news articles, books, and online forums. The model is trained on this dataset and evaluated on its ability to generalize to new, unseen texts. The results show that the model learns to recognize moral concepts, such as justice, fairness, and harm, and can distinguish between morally right and wrong texts. Enrico concludes that the model's performance is influenced by its training data, highlighting the importance of diverse and representative data for moral language understanding. He also discusses the potential applications of his research, including improving moral decision-making in AI systems and enhancing human-AI collaboration.</sample>

Hello everyone, I'm Zhen Mi-hang from Peking University. I'm here to present our work on Generating Structured Student Labellers for zero-shot video-sense localization. This research was a collaboration with Shaogang, Ailing, Yu Xin, and Yang. Our focus is on zero-shot video-sense localization, which aims to identify the most relevant segments in unknown videos without providing any natural language queries. This task is challenging because it requires the model to understand the video content without any prior knowledge. Our approach generates structured student labellers, which are used to train a model that can learn to localize relevant segments in videos. The model is trained on a dataset of annotated videos and then tested on unseen videos. Our results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the zero-shot video-sense localization task, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin.</sample>

I'd like to acknowledge my collaborators: Jingjing Xu from Shanghai AILAP, Shu Jianhuang and Jia Juncheng from Nan University, and Lin Pongkong from the University of Hong Kong. Our work focuses on neural machine translation. We know that the target of AMD is to improve translation quality. We propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of both attention-based and sequence-to-sequence models. Our method uses a nearest neighbor search algorithm to find the most similar source sentence in the training data for a given target sentence. This approach allows us to leverage the knowledge from the entire training data to improve the translation quality. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and achieve significant improvements in translation accuracy. Our results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models in many cases.</sample>

The speaker, Matthias Lendemann, introduces a paper on compositional generalization without trees using multi-set tagging and latent permutations. Compositional generalization refers to the ability of a learner to handle deeper recursion and unseen compositions. The authors, including Lendemann and his advisors Alexander Kodler and Ivan Titov, aim to improve this ability by developing a new approach. The approach uses multi-set tagging, which assigns multiple labels to each token, and latent permutations, which reorder the tokens to create new compositions. This allows the model to generalize to unseen compositions by generating new permutations of the tokens. The authors claim that this approach can improve compositional generalization and provide more accurate results. The paper presents an innovative solution to the problem of compositional generalization and has the potential to advance the field of natural language processing.</sample>

    <sample id="348">Myra, Essendir Moush, and Dan Jerovsky have developed a new approach to measure stereotypes in language models using natural language prompts. The team aims to address the limitations of previous methods, which rely on hand-curated datasets that are time-consuming to create. The researchers use a novel approach, "Marked Personas," to identify and quantify social biases in large language models. This method involves creating a set of prompts that elicit stereotypical responses from the models, allowing for a more efficient and effective assessment of bias. The Marked Personas approach has the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the social biases present in language models, which is crucial for developing more accurate and unbiased AI systems. The team's work has implications for a wide range of applications, from natural language processing to human-computer interaction, and could ultimately lead to more equitable and fair AI systems.</sample>

Hello everyone and welcome to the presentation of our paper on the meaning of superhuman performance in today's NLU. I am Simone Tudischi and this is a joint work with several renowned researchers from various institutions around the world. In the last five years, leaderboard-based evaluation has become the de facto standard in NLP, and consequently, the main objective has become to reach the top spot in popular benchmarks. Not infrequently, systems achieve human-level or even superhuman performance in such benchmarks. However, this raises the question of what it actually means to be superhuman in NLU. Is it simply a matter of outperforming humans, or is there something more to it? Our paper explores this question and proposes a new framework for evaluating and understanding superhuman performance in NLU. We argue that superhuman performance is not just about achieving high scores on benchmarks, but also about the ability to generalize to new tasks and domains. We also discuss the implications of superhuman performance for the development of AI systems and their potential applications in various fields.</sample>

This presentation, titled "Do Kono 2003 Named Entity Taggers Still Work in 2023", investigates the generalization problem in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. The authors observed that many models still rely on the Kono 2003 dataset to develop NER systems. The study aims to evaluate the performance of these models in 2023, 20 years after the dataset was introduced. The results show that the models' performance has not significantly improved, indicating a lack of generalization to new datasets. The authors conclude that the reliance on Kono 2003 may hinder the development of more accurate and robust NER systems.</sample>

Title: Counter Comp: Improving Compositional Generalization for Multi-Step Quantitative Reasoning using Counterfactual Scenarios

This research presents a novel approach to improve compositional generalization for multi-step quantitative reasoning in question answering tasks. The method, called Counter Comp, utilizes counterfactual scenarios to enhance the ability to reason over complex financial tables. The goal is to enable users to answer questions about financial data, such as the table displayed on the slide. The approach involves generating counterfactual scenarios that modify the original data to test the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new situations. By training on these scenarios, the model can learn to reason more effectively over complex financial data, improving its ability to answer multi-step quantitative questions. The research aims to advance the field of natural language processing and its applications in finance and other domains.</sample>
